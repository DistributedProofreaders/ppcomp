<h3 id="THE_NOVEL">THE NOVEL</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THOSE who read no books but new ones have this much 
to say for themselves in mitigation of censure: they do not read all the
 new ones. They can not; with the utmost diligence and devotion—never 
weary in ill doing—they can not hope to get through one in a hundred. 
This, I should suppose, must make them unhappy. They probably feel as a 
small boy of limited capacity would in a country with all the springs 
running treacle and all the trees loaded with preserved fruits.</p>
<p>The annual output of books in this country alone is something 
terrible—not fewer, I am told, than from seven thousand to nine 
thousand. This should be enough to gratify the patriot who “points with 
pride” to the fact that Americans are a reading people, but does not 
point with anything to the quality of what they read. There are 
apparently more novels than anything else, and these have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> incomparably the largest sales. The “best seller” is always a novel and a bad one.</p>
<p>In my poor judgment there have not been published in any one 
quarter-century a half dozen novels that posterity will take the trouble
 to read. It is not to be denied that some are worth reading, for some 
have been written by great writers; and whatever is written by a great 
writer is likely to merit attention. But between that which is worth 
reading and that which was worth writing there is a distinction. For a 
man who can do great work, to do work that is less great than the best 
that he can do is not worthwhile, and novel-writing, I hold, does not 
bring out the best that is in him.</p>
<p>The novel bears the same relation to literature that the panorama 
bears to painting. With whatever skill and feeling the panorama is 
painted, it must lack that basic quality in all art, unity, totality of 
effect. As it can not all be seen at once, its parts must be seen 
successively, each effacing the one seen before; and at the last there 
remains no coherent and harmonious memory of the work. It is the same 
with a story too long to be read with a virgin attention at a single 
sitting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>
<p>A novel is a diluted story—a story cumbered with trivialities and 
nonessentials. I have never seen one that could not be bettered by 
cutting out a half or three-quarters of it.</p>
<p>The novel is a snow plant; it has no root in the permanent soil of 
literature, and does not long hold its place. It is of the lowest form 
of imagination—imagination chained to the perch of probability. What 
wonder that in this unnatural captivity it pines and dies? The novelist 
is, after all, but a reporter of a larger growth. True, he invents his 
facts (which the reporter of the newspaper is known never to do) and his
 characters; but, having them in hand, what can he do? His chains are 
heavier than himself. The line that bounds his little Dutch garden of 
probability, separating it from the golden realm of art—the sun and 
shadow land of fancy—is to him a dead-line. Let him transgress it at his
 peril.</p>
<p>In England and America the art of novel-writing (in so far as it is 
an art) is as dead as Queen Anne; in America as dead as Queen Ameresia. 
(There never was a Queen Ameresia—that is why I choose her for the 
comparison.)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> As a literary 
method it never had any other element of vitality than the quality from 
which it has its name. Having no legitimate place in the scheme of 
letters, its end was inevitable.</p>
<p>When Richardson and Fielding set the novel going, hardly more than a 
century-and-a-half ago, it charmed a generation to which it was new. 
From their day to ours, with a lessening charm, it has taken the 
attention of the multitude, and grieved the judicious, but, its impulse 
exhausted, it stops by its inherent inertia. Its dead body we shall have
 with us, doubtless, for many years, but its soul “is with the saints, I
 trust.”</p>
<p>This is true, not only locally but generally. So far as I am able to 
judge, no good novels are now “made in Germany,” nor in France, nor in 
any European country except Russia. The Russians are writing novels 
which so far as one may venture to judge (dimly discerning their quality
 through the opacity of translation, for one does not read Russian) are,
 in their way, admirable; full of fire and light, like an opal. 
Tourgenieff, Pushkin, Gogol and the early Tolstoi—these be big names. In
 their hands the novel grew great (as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
 did in those of Richardson and Fielding, and as it would have done in 
those of Thackeray and Pater if greatness in that form of fiction had 
been longer possible in England) because, first, they were great men, 
and second, the novel was a new form of expression in a world of new 
thought and life. In Russia the soil is not exhausted: it produces 
without fertilizers. There we find simple, primitive conditions, and the
 novel holds something of the elemental passions of the race, 
unsophisticated by introspection, analysis of motive, problemism, 
dissection of character, and the other “odious subtleties” that go 
before a fall. But the blight is upon it even there, with an 
encroachment visible in the compass of a single lifetime. Compare 
Tolstoy’s <i>The Cossacks</i> with his latest work in fiction, and you 
will see an individual decadence prefiguring a national; just as one was
 seen in the interval between <i>Adam Bede</i> and <i>Daniel Deronda</i>.
 When the story-teller is ambitious to be a philosopher there is an end 
to good storytelling. Novelists are now all philosophers—excepting those
 who have “stumbled to eternal mock” as reformers.</p>
<p>With the romance—which in form so resembles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
 the novel that many otherwise worthy persons are but dimly aware of the
 essential distinction—matters are somewhat otherwise. The romancist has
 not to encounter at a disadvantage the formidable competition of his 
reader’s personal experience. He can represent life, not as it is, but 
as it might be; character, not as he finds it, but as he wants it. His 
plot knows no law but that of its own artistic development; his 
incidents do not require the authenticating hand and seal of any 
censorship but that of taste. The vitality of his art is eternal; it is 
perpetually young. He taps the great permanent mother-lode of human 
interest. His materials are infinite in abundance and cosmic in 
distribution. Nothing that can be known, or thought, or felt, or 
dreamed, but is available if he can manage it. He is lord of two worlds 
and may select his characters from both. In the altitudes where his 
imagination waves her joyous wing there are no bars for her to beat her 
breast against; the universe is hers, and unlike the sacred bird 
Simurgh, which is omnipotent on condition of never exerting its power, 
she may do as she will. And so it comes about that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
 while the novel is accidental and transient, the romance is essential 
and permanent. The novelist, whatever his ability, writes in the 
shifting sand; the only age that understands his work is that which has 
not forgotten the social conditions environing his characters—namely, 
their own period; but the romancist has cut his work into the living 
rock. Richardson and Fielding already seem absurd. We are beginning to 
quarrel with Thackeray, and Dickens needs a glossary. Thirty years ago I
 saw a list of scores of words used by Dickens that had become obsolete.
 They were mostly the names of homely household objects no longer in 
use; he had named them in giving “local color” and the sense of 
“reality.” Contemporary novels are read by none but the reviewers and 
the multitude—which will read anything if it is long, untrue and new 
enough. Men of sane judgment and taste still illuminate their minds and 
warm their hearts in Scott’s suffusing glow; the strange, heatless 
glimmer of Hawthorne fascinates more and more; the Thousand-and-One 
Nights holds its captaincy of tale-telling. Whatever a great man does he
 is likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> to do greatly, 
but had Hugo set the powers of his giant intellect to the making of mere
 novels his superiority to the greatest of those who have worked in that
 barren art might have seemed somewhat less measureless than it is.</p>

<h3 id="ON_LITERARY_CRITICISM">ON LITERARY CRITICISM</h3>
</div>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="drop-cap">THE saddest thing about the trade of writing is that
 the writer can never know, nor hope to know, if he is a good workman. 
In literary criticism there are no criteria, no accepted standards of 
excellence by which to test the work. Sainte-Beuve says that the art of 
criticism consists in saying the first thing that comes into one’s head.
 Doubtless he was thinking of his own head, a fairly good one. There is a
 difference between the first thing that comes into one head and the 
first thing that comes into another; and it is not always the best kind 
of head that concerns itself with literary criticism.</p>
<p>Having no standards, criticism is an erring guide. Its pronouncements
 are more interesting than valuable, and interesting chiefly from the 
insight that they give into the mind, not of the writer criticised, but 
of the writer criticising. Hence the greater interest that they have 
when delivered by one of whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
 the reader already knows something. So the newspapers are not 
altogether unwise when asking an eminent merchant to pass judgment on a 
new poet, or a distinguished soldier to “sit” in the case of a rising 
young novelist. We learn something about the merchant or the soldier, 
and that may amuse. As a guide to literary excellence even the most 
accomplished critic’s judgment on his contemporaries is of little value.
 Posterity more frequently reverses than affirms it.</p>
<p>The reason is not far to seek. An author’s work is usually the 
product of his environment. He collaborates with his era; his co-workers
 are time and place. All his neighbors and all the conditions in which 
they live have a hand in the work. His own individuality, unless 
uncommonly powerful and original, is “subdued to what it works in.” But 
this is true, too, of his critic, whose limitations are drawn by the 
same iron authority. Subject to the same influences, good and bad, 
following the same literary fashions, the critic who is contemporary 
with his author holds his court in the market-place and polls a 
fortuitous jury. In diagnosing the disorder of a person suspected of 
hydrophobia the physician<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> ought not to have been bitten by the same dog.</p>
<p>The taste of the many being notoriously bad and that of the few 
dubious, what is the author to do for judgment on his work? He is to 
wait. In a few centuries, more or less, may arise a critic that we call 
Posterity. This fellow will have as many limitations, probably, as the 
other had—will bow the knee to as many literary Baäls and err as widely 
from the paths leading to the light. But his false gods will not be 
those of to-day, whose hideousness will disclose itself to his undevout 
vision, and in his deviations from the true trail he will cross and 
chart our tracks. Better than all, he will know and care little about 
the lives and characters, the personalities, of those of us whose work 
has lasted till his time. On that coign of vantage he will stand and 
deliver a juster judgment. It will enable him to judge our work with 
impartiality, as if it had fallen from the skies or sprung up from the 
ground without human agency.</p>
<p>One can hardly overrate the advantage to the critic of ignorance of 
his author. Biographies of men of action are well enough; the lives that
 such men live are all there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
 of them except themselves. But men of thought—that is different. You 
can not narrate thought, nor describe it, yet it is the only relevant 
thing in the life of an author. Anything else darkens counsel. We go to 
biography for side lights on an author’s work; to his work for side 
lights on his character. The result is confusion and disability, for 
personal character and literary character have little to say to each 
other, despite the fact that so tremendous a chap as Taine builded an 
entire and most unearthly biography of Shakspeare on no firmer 
foundation than the “internal evidence” of the plays and sonnets. Of all
 the influences that make for incapable criticism the biographer of 
authors is the most pernicious. One needs not be a friend to organized 
labor to wish that the fellow’s working hours might be reduced from 
twenty-four to eight.</p>
<p>Neither the judgment of the populace nor that of the critics being of
 value to an author concerned about his rank in the hierarchy of 
letters, and that of posterity being a trifle slow, he seems to be 
reduced to the expedient of taking his own word for it. And his opinion 
of himself may not be so far out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> the way. Read Goethe’s conversations with Eckermann and see how accurately the great man appraised himself.</p>
<p>When scratched in a newspaper Heine said: “I am to be judged in the assizes of literature. I know who I am.”</p>
<p>About the shrine of every famous author awaits a cloud of critics to 
pay an orderly and decorous homage to his genius. There is no crowding: 
if one of them sees that he can not perform his prostration until after 
his saint shall have been forgotten along with the intellectual miracles
 he wrought, that patient worshiper turns aside to level his shins at 
another shrine. There are shrines enough for all, God knows!</p>
<p>The most mischievous, because the ablest, of all this sycophantic 
crew is Mr. Howells, who finds every month, and reads, two or three 
books—always novels—of high literary merit. As no man who has anything 
else to do can critically read more than two or three books in a 
month—and I will say for Mr. Howells that he is a conscientious 
reader—and as some hundreds are published in the same period, one is 
curious to know how many books of high literary merit he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
 find if he could read them all. But Mr. Howells is no ordinary 
sycophant—not he. True, having by mischance read a book divinely bad, 
even when judged according to his own test, and having resolved to 
condemn nothing except in a general way—as the artillerists in the early
 days of the Civil War used to “shell the woods”—he does not purpose to 
lose his labor, and therefore commends the book along with the others; 
but as a rule he distributes the distinctions that he has to confer 
according to a system—to those, namely, whose work in fiction most 
nearly resembles his own. That is his way of propagating the Realistic 
faith which his poverty of imagination has compelled him to adopt and 
his necessities to defend. “Ah, yes, a beautiful animal,” said the camel
 of the horse—“if he only had a hump!”</p>
<p>To show what literary criticism has accomplished in education of the 
public taste I beg to refer the reader to any number of almost any 
magazine. Here is one, for instance, containing a paper by one Bowker on
 contemporary English novelists—he novelists and she novelists—to the 
number of about forty. And only the “eminent” ones are mentioned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
 To most American readers some of the books of most of these authors are
 more or less familiar, and nine in ten of these readers will 
indubitably accept Mr. Bowker’s high estimate of the genius of the 
authors themselves. These have one good quality—they are industrious: 
most of them have published ten to forty novels each, the latter number 
being the favorite at this date and eliciting Mr. Bowker’s lively 
admiration. The customary rate of production is one a year, though two 
are not unusual, there being nothing in the law forbidding. Mr. Bowker 
has the goodness to tell us all he knows about these persons’ methods of
 work; that is to say, all that they have told him. The amount of 
patient research, profound thought and systematic planning that go to 
the making of one of their books is (naturally) astonishing. 
Unfortunately it falls just short of the amount that kills.</p>
<p>Add to the forty eminent English novelists another forty American, 
equally eminent—at least in their own country—and similarly industrious.
 We have then an average annual output of, say, eighty novels which have
 the right to expect to be widely read and enthusiastically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
 reviewed. This in two countries, in one of which the art of novel 
writing is dead, in the other of which it has not been born. Truly this 
is an age of growing literary activity; our novelists are as lively and 
diligent as maggots in the carcass of a horse. There is a revival of 
baseball, too.</p>
<p>If our critics were wiser than their dupes could this mass of 
insufferable stuff be dumped upon the land? Could the little men and 
foolish women who write it command the persevering admiration of their 
fellow-creatures, who think it a difficult thing to do? I make no 
account here of the mere book-reporters of the newspapers, whose purpose
 and ambition are, not to guide the public taste but to follow it, and 
who are therefore in no sense critics. The persons whom I am considering
 are those ingenious gentlemen who in the magazines and reviews are 
expected to, and do, write of books with entire independence of their 
own market. Are there anywhere more than one, two or three like Percival
 Pollard, with “Gifford’s heavy hand” to “crush without remorse” the 
intolerable rout of commonplace men and women swarming innumerous upon 
the vacant seats of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> dead giants and covering the slopes of Parnassus like a flock of crows?</p>
<p>Your critic of widest vogue and chief authority among us is he who is
 best skilled in reading between the lines; in interpreting an author’s 
purpose; in endowing him with a “problem” and noting his degree of skill
 in its solution. The author—stupid fellow!—did not write between the 
lines, had no purpose but to entertain, was unaware of a problem. So 
much the worse for him; so much the better for his expounder. 
Interlinear cipher, purpose, problem, are all the critic’s own, and he 
derives a lively satisfaction in his creation—looks upon it and 
pronounces it good. Nothing is more certain than that if a writer of 
genius should “bring to his task” of writing a book the purposes which 
the critics would surely trace in the completed work the book would 
remain forever unwritten, to the unspeakble advantage of letters and 
morals.</p>
<p>In illustration of these remarks and suggesting them, take these book reviews in a single number of <i>The Atlantic</i>. There we learn, concerning Mr. Cable, that his controlling purpose in <i>The Grandissimes</i> was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> of “presenting the problem of the reorganization of Southern society”—that “the book was in effect a parable”; that in <i>Dr. Sevier</i>
 he “essayed to work out through personal relations certain problems 
[always a problem or two] which vexed him regarding poverty and labor”; 
that in <i>Bonaventure</i> he “sets himself another task,” which is “to 
work out [always something to ‘work out’] the regeneration of man 
through knowledge”—a truly formidable “task.” Of the author of <i>Queen Money</i>,
 we are told by the same expounder that she has “set herself no task 
beyond her power,” but “had it in mind to trace the influence of the 
greed for wealth upon a section of contemporaneous society.” Of Mr. 
Bellamy, author of <i>Looking Backward</i> (the heroine of which is not 
Mrs. Lot) we are confidently assured in ailing metaphor that “he feels 
intensely the bitter inequalities of the present order” of things and 
“thinks he sees a remedy,”—our old friends again: the “problem” and the 
“solution”—both afterthoughts of Mr. Bellamy. The “task” which in <i>Marzio’s Crucifix</i> Marion Crawford “sets himself” is admirably simple—by a “characteristic outwardness” to protect us against “a too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
 intimate and subtle corrosive of life.” As a savior of the world 
against this awful peril Crawford may justly have claimed a vote of 
thanks; but possibly he was content with that humbler advantage, the 
profit from the sale of his book. But (it may be protested) the critic 
who is to live by his trade must say <i>something</i>. True, but is it necessary that he live by his trade?</p>
<p>Carlyle’s prophecy of a time when all literature should be one vast 
review is in process of fulfilment. Aubrey de Vere has written a 
critical analysis of poetry, chiefly that of Spenser and Wordsworth. An <i>Atlantic</i> man writes a critical analysis of Aubrey de Vere’s critical analysis. Shall I not write a critical analysis of the <i>Atlantic</i> man’s critical analysis of Aubrey de Vere’s critical analysis of poetry? I can do so adequately in three words: It is nonsense.</p>
<p>Spenser, also, it appears, “set himself a task,” had his “problem,” 
“worked it out.” “The figures of his embroidered poem,” we are told, 
“are conceived and used in accordance with a comprehensive doctrine of 
the nature of humanity, which Spenser undoubtedly meant to enforce 
through the medium of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> his imagination.” That is to say, the author of <i>The Faerie Queene</i>
 did not “sing because he could not choose but sing,” but because he was
 burdened with a doctrine. He had a nut to crack and, faith! he must 
crack it or he would be sick. “Resolved into its moral elements” 
(whether by Aubrey de Vere or the <i>Atlantic</i> man I can only guess 
without reading de Vere’s work in two volumes, which God forbid!) the 
glowing work of Spenser is a sermon which “teaches specifically how to 
attain self-control and how to meet attacks from without; or rather how 
to seek those many forms of error which do mischief in the world, and to
 overcome them for the world’s welfare.” Precisely: the animal is a pig 
and a bird; or rather it is a fish. So much for Spenser, whom his lovers
 may re-read if they like in the new light of this person’s critical 
analysis. It is rather hard that, being dead, he can not have the 
advantage of going over his work with so intelligent a guide as Aubrey 
de Vere. He would be astonished by his own profundity.</p>
<p>How literary reviewing may be acceptably done in Boston may be judged by the following passage from the Boston <i>Literary Review</i>:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>
<p>“When Miss Emma Frances Dawson wrote <i>An Itinerant House</i> she 
was plainly possessed of a desire to emulate Poe and turn out a 
collection of stories which, once read, the mention of them would make 
the blood curdle. There is no need to say that Poe’s position is still 
secure, but Miss Dawson has succeeded in writing some very creditable 
stories of their kind.”</p>
<p>The reviewer that can discern in Miss Dawson’s work “a desire to 
emulate Poe,” or can find in it even a faint suggestion of Poe, may 
justly boast himself accessible to any folly that comes his way. There 
is no more similarity between the work of the two writers than there is 
between that of Dickens and that of Macaulay, or that of Addison and 
that of Carlyle. Poe in his prose tales deals sometimes with the 
supernatural; Miss Dawson always. But hundreds of writers do the same; 
if that constitutes similarity and suggests intentional “emulation” what
 shall be said of those tales which resemble one another in that 
element’s omission? The truth probably is that the solemn gentleman who 
wrote that judgment had not read Poe since childhood, and did not read 
Miss Dawson at all. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
 no excellence in her work would have saved it from his disparaging 
comparison if he had read it. “Poe’s position” would still have been a 
“secure,” for to such minds as his it is unthinkable that an established
 fame (no matter how, when or where established) should not signify an 
unapproachable merit. If he had lived in Poe’s time how he would have 
sneered at that writer’s attempt to emulate Walpole! And had he been a 
contemporary of Walpole that ambitious person would have incurred a 
stinging rap on the head for aspiring to displace the immortal Gormley 
Hobb.</p>
<p>The fellow goes on:</p>
<p>“To one steeped in the gruesome weirdness of a master of the gentle 
art of blood-curdling the stories are not too impressive, but he who 
picks up the book fresh from a fairy tale is apt to become somewhat 
nervous in the reading. The tales allow Miss Dawson to weave in some 
very pretty verse.”</p>
<p>The implication that Miss Dawson’s tales are intended to be 
“gruesome,” “blood-curdling,” and so forth, is a foolish implication. 
Their supernaturalism is not of that kind. The blood that they could 
curdle is diseased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> blood 
which it would be at once a kindly office and a high delight to shed. 
And fancy this inexpressible creature calling Miss Dawson’s verse 
“pretty”!—the <i>ballade</i> of “The Sea of Sleep” “pretty”! My compliments to him:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Dull spirit, few among us be your days,</div>
<div class="i0">The bright to damn, the fatuous to praise;</div>
<div class="i0">And God deny, your flesh when you unload,</div>
<div class="i0">Your prayer to live as tenant of a toad,</div>
<div class="i0">With powers direr than your present sort:</div>
<div class="i0">Able the wights you jump on to bewart.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The latest author of “uncanny” tales to suffer from the ready 
reckoner’s short cut to the solution of the problem of literary merit, 
the ever-serviceable comparison with Edgar Allan Poe, is Mr. W. C. 
Morrow. Doubtless he had hoped that this cup might pass by him—had 
implored the rosy goddess Psora, who enjoys the critic’s person and 
inspires his pen, to go off duty, but it was not to be; that diligent 
deity is never weary of ill doing and her devotees, pursuing the evil 
tenor of their way, have sounded the Scotch fiddle to the customary 
effect. Mr. Morrow’s admirable book, <i>The Ape, the Idiot and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> Other People</i>,
 is gravely ascribed to the paternity of Poe, as was Miss Dawson’s 
before it, and some of mine before that. And until Gabriel, with one 
foot upon the sea and the other upon the neck of the last living critic,
 shall swear that the time for doing this thing is up, every writer of 
stories a little out of the common must suffer the same sickening 
indignity. To the ordinary microcephalous bibliopomps—the book-butchers 
of the newspapers—criticism is merely a process of marking upon the 
supposed stature of an old writer the supposed stature of a new, without
 ever having taken the trouble to measure that of the old; they accept 
hearsay evidence for that. Does one write “gruesome stories”?—they 
invoke Poe; essays?—they out with their Addison; satirical verse?—they 
have at him with Pope—and so on, through the entire category of literary
 forms. Each has its dominant great name, learned usually in the 
district school, easily carried in memory and obedient to the call of 
need. And because these strabismic ataxiates, who fondly fancy 
themselves shepherding auctorial flocks upon the slopes of Parnassus, 
are unable to write of one writer without thinking of another, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
 naturally assume that the writer of whom they write is affected with 
the same disability and has always in mind as a model the standard name 
dominating his chosen field—the impeccant hegemon of the province.</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>Mr. Hamlin Garland, writing with the corn-fed enthusiasm of the 
prairies, “hails the dawn of a new era” in literature—an era which is to
 be distinguished by dominance of the Western man. That a great new 
literature is to “come out of the West” because of broad prairies and 
wide rivers and big mountains and infrequent boundary lines—that is a 
conviction dear indeed to the Western mind which has discovered that 
marks can be made on paper with a pen. A few years ago the Eastern mind 
was waiting wide-eyed to “hail the dawn” of a literature that was to be 
“distinctively American,” for the Eastern mind in those days claimed a 
share in the broad prairies, the wide rivers and the big mountains, with
 all the competencies, suggestions, inspirations and other appurtenances
 thereunto belonging—a heritage which now Mr. Garland austerely denies 
to any one born and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> “raised”
 on the morning side of the Alleghanies. The “distinctively American 
literature” has not materialized, excepting in the works of Americans 
distinctively illiterate; and there are no visible signs of a 
distinctively Western one. Even the Californian sort, so long heralded 
by prophets blushing with conscious modesty in the foretelling, seems 
loth to leave off its damnable faces and begin. The best Californian, 
the best Western, the best American books have the least of geographical
 “distinctiveness,” and most closely conform to the universal and 
immutable laws of the art, as known to Aristotle and Longinus.</p>
<p>The effect of physical-geographical environment on literary 
production is mostly nil; racial and educational considerations only are
 of controlling importance. Despite Madame de Staël’s engaging dictum 
that “every Englishman is an island,” the natives of that scanty plot 
have produced a literature which in breadth of thought and largeness of 
method we sons of a continent, brothers to the broad prairies, wide 
rivers and big mountains, have not matched and give no promise of 
matching. It is all very fine to be a child o’ natur’ with a home in the
 settin’ sun, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> when the 
child o’ natur’ with a knack at scribbling pays rent to Phœbus by 
renouncing the incomparable advantage of strict subjection to literary 
law he pays too dearly.</p>
<p>Nothing new is to be learned in any of the great arts—the ancients 
looted the whole field. Nor do first-rate minds seek anything new. They 
are assured of primacy under the conditions of their art as they find 
it—under any conditions. It is the lower order of intelligence that is 
ingenious, inventive, alert for original methods and new forms. Napoleon
 added nothing to the art of war, in either strategy or tactics. 
Shakspeare tried no new meters, did nothing that had not been done 
before—merely did better what had been done. In the Parthenon was no new
 architectural device, and in the Sistine Madonna all the effects were 
got by methods as familiar as speech. The only way in which it is worth 
while to differ from others is in point of superior excellence. Be 
“original,” ambitious Westerner—always as original as you please. But 
know, or if you already know remember, that originality strikes and 
dazzles only when displayed within the limiting lines of form. Above 
all, remember that the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> 
ineffective thing in literature is that quality, whatever in any case it
 may be, which is best designated in terms of geographical 
classification. The work of whose form and methods one naturally thinks 
as—not “English”; that is a racial word, but—“American” or “Australian” 
or (in this country) “Eastern,” “Mid-Western,” “Southern” or 
“Californian” is worthless. The writer who knows no better than to make 
or try to make his work “racy of the soil” knows nothing of his art 
worth knowing.</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p>Charles A. Dana held that California could not rightly claim the 
glory of such literature as she had, for none of her writers of 
distinction—such distinction as they had—was born there. We were 
austerely reminded that “even the sheen of gold is less attractive than 
the lustre of intellectual genius.” “California!” cried this severe but 
not uncompassionate critic—“California! how musical is the word. And 
again we cry out, California! Give us the letters of high thought: give 
us philosophy and romance and poetry and art. Give us the soul!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>
<p>How many men and women who scorn delights and live laborious days to 
glorify our metropolis with “the letters of high thought” are on Fame’s 
muster-roll as natives of Manhattan island? Doubtless the state of New 
York, as also the city of that name, can make an honorable showing in 
the matter of native authors, but it has certain considerable advantages
 that California lacks. In the first place, there are many more births 
in New York, supplying a strong numerical presumption that more geniuses
 will turn up there. Second, it has (I hope) enjoyed that advantage for 
many, many years; whereas California was “settled” (and by the 
non-genius-bearing sex) a good deal later. In this competition the 
native Californian author is handicapped by the onerous condition that 
in order to have his nose counted he must have been born in the 
pre-Woman period or acquired enough of reputation for the rumor of his 
merit to have reached New York’s ears, and for the noise of it to have 
roused her from the contemplation of herself, before he has arrived at 
middle age. This is not an “impossible” condition; it is only an 
exceedingly hard one. How hard it is a little reflection on facts will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
 show. The rule is, the world over, that the literary army of the 
“metropolis” is recruited in the “provinces,” or, more accurately, <i>from</i>
 the provinces. The difference denoted by the prepositions is important:
 for every provincial writer who, like Bret Harte, achieves at home 
enough distinction to be sought out and lured to a “literary 
metropolis,” ten unknown ones go there of their own motion, like Rudyard
 Kipling, and become distinguished afterward. They wrote equally well 
where they were, but they might have continued to write there until dead
 of age, and but for some lucky accident or fortuitous concurrence of 
favoring circumstances they would never have been heard of in the 
“literary metropolis.”</p>
<p>We may call it so, but New York is not a literary metropolis, nor is 
London, nor is Paris. In letters there is no metropolis. The literary 
capital is not a mother-city, founding colonies; it is the creature of 
its geographical environment, giving out nothing, taking in everything. 
If not constantly fed with fresh brains from beyond and about, its 
chance of primacy and domination would be merely proportional to its 
population. This centripetal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
 tendency—this converging movement of provincial writers upon the 
literary capital, is itself the strongest possible testimony to the 
disadvantages which they suffer at home; for in nearly every instance it
 is made—commonly at a great sacrifice—in pursuit of recognition. The 
motive may not be a very creditable one; I think myself it is 
ridiculous, as is all ambition, not to excel, but to be known to excel; 
but such is the motive. If the provincial writer could as easily obtain 
recognition at home he would stay there.</p>
<p>For my part, I freely admit that “the Golden State can not ‘boast’ of
 any native literary celebrities of the first rank,” for I do not 
consider the incident of a literary celebrity of the first rank having 
been born in one place instead of another a thing to boast of. If there 
is an idler and more barren work than the rating of writers according to
 merit it is their classification according to birthplace. A racial 
classification is interesting because it corresponds to something in 
nature, but among authors of the same race—and that race the restless 
Americans, who are about as likely to be born in a railway car as 
anywhere, and whose first instinct is to get away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
 home—this classification is without meaning. If it is ever otherwise 
than capitally impudent in the people of a political or geographical 
division to be proud of a great writer (as George the Third was of an 
abundant harvest) it is least impudent in those of the one in which he 
did his worthiest work, most so in those of the one in which he was 
born.</p>

<h3 id="STAGE_ILLUSION">STAGE ILLUSION</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">SUCH to-day is the condition of the drama that the 
“scenic artist” and the carpenter are its hope and its pride. They are 
the props and pillars of the theatre, without which the edifice would 
fall to pieces. But there are “some of us fellows,” as a Bishop of 
Lincoln used to say to his brother prelates, who consider scenery an 
impertinence and its painter a creature for whose existence there is no 
warrant of art nor justification of taste.</p>
<p>I am no <i>laudator temporis acti</i>, but I submit that in this 
matter of the drama the wisdom of the centuries is better than the 
caprice of the moment. For some thousands of years, dramatists, actors 
and audiences got on very well without recourse to the mechanical 
devices that we esteem necessary to the art of stage representation. 
Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Shakspeare—what did they know of scenery
 and machinery? You may say that the Greeks knew little of painting, so 
could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> have no scenery. They 
had something better—imagination. Why did they not use pulleys, and 
trap-doors, and real water, and live horses?—they had <i>them</i>; and 
Ben Jonson and Shakspeare could have had painters enow, God knows. Why, 
in their time the stage was lighted with naked and unashamed candles and
 strewn with rushes, and favored ones of the audience—“gentlemen of wit 
and pleasure about town”—occupied seats upon it! If the action was 
supposed to be taking place in a street in Verona did not the play-bill 
so explain? A word to the wise was sufficient: the gentlemen of wit and 
pleasure went to the play to watch the actor’s face, observe his 
gestures, critically note his elocution. They would have resented with 
their handy hangers an attempt to obtrude upon their attention the 
triumphs of the “scenic artist,” the machinist and the property-man. As 
for the “groundlings,” they were there by sufferance only, and might 
comprehend or not, as it might or might not please their Maker to work a
 miracle in their stupid nowls.</p>
<p><i>Now</i> it is all for the groundlings; the stage has no longer 
“patrons,” and “His Majesty’s Players” are the servants of the masses, 
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> whom the author’s text 
must be presented with explanatory notes by those learned commentators, 
Messrs. Daub and Toggle—whom may the good devil besmear with yellows and
 make mad with a tin moon!</p>
<p>What! shall I go to the theatre to be pleased with colored canvas, 
affrighted with a storm that is half dried peas and t’other half 
sheet-iron? Shall I take any part of my evening’s pleasure from the 
dirty hands of an untidy anarchist who shakes a blue rag to represent 
the Atlantic Ocean, while another sandlot orator navigates a cloth-yard 
three-decker across the middle distance? Am I to be interested in the 
personal appearance of a centre-table and the adventures of half a dozen
 chairs—albeit they are better than the one given me to sit on?</p>
<div class="center-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Shall makers of fine furniture aspire</div>
<div class="i0">To scorn my lower needs and feed my higher?</div>

<div class="i0">My body’s comfort for my mind’s delight?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Where is the sense of all these devices for producing an “illusion?” 
Illusion, indeed! When you look at art do you wish to persuade yourself 
that it is only nature? Take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
 Laocoön—would it be pleasant or instructive to forget, for even a 
moment, that it is a group of inanimate figures, and think yourself 
gazing on a living man and two living children in the folds of two 
living snakes? When you stand before a “nativity” by some old master, do
 you fancy yourself a real ass at a real manger? Deception is no part of
 art, for only in its non-essentials is art a true copy of nature. If it
 is anything more, why, then the Shah of Persia was a judicious critic. 
Shown a picture of a donkey by Landseer and told that it was worth five 
hundred pounds, he contemptuously replied that for five pounds he could 
buy the donkey. The man who holds that art should be a certified copy of
 nature, and produce an illusion in the mind, has no right to smile at 
this anecdote. It is his business in this life not to laugh, but to be 
laughed at.</p>
<p>Seeing that stage illusion is neither desirable nor attainable, the 
determined efforts to achieve it that have been making during these last
 few decades seem very melancholy indeed. It is as if a dog should spin 
himself sick in pursuit of his tail, which he neither can catch nor 
could profit by if he caught it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
 Failure displeases in proportion to the effort, and it would be 
judicious to stop a little short of real water, and live horses, and 
trains of cars that will work. Nay, why should we have streets and 
drawing-rooms (with mantel-clocks and coal scuttles complete) and 
castles with battlements? Or if the play is so vilely constructed as to 
require them, why must the street have numbered house-doors, the 
drawing-room an adjoining library and conservatory, and the battlements a
 growth of ivy? Of course no sane mind would justify poor Boucicault’s 
wall that sinks to represent the ascent of the man “climbing it” by 
standing on the ground and working his legs, but we are only a trifle 
less ridiculous when we have any scenic effects at all. The difference 
is one of degree, and if we are to have representations of inanimate 
objects it is hard to say at what we should stick. Our intellectual 
gorge may now rise at the spectacle of a battered and blood-stained 
“Nancy” dragging her wrecked carcass along the stage to escape the club 
of a “Sykes,” for it is as new as once were the horrible death-agonies 
constituting the charm of the acting of a Croizette; but the line of 
distinction is arbitrary, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
 no one can say how soon we shall expect to see the blood of “Cæsar” 
spouting from his wound instead of being content with “Antony’s” rather 
graphic description of it. It is of the nature of realism never to stop 
till it gets to the bottom.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the actor must wear something—a necessity from which the 
actress is largely free—he may as well wear the costume appropriate to 
his part. But this is about as far as art permits him to go in the way 
of “illusion”; another step and he is on the “unsteadfast footing” of 
popular caprice and vulgar fashion. Of course if the playwright has 
chosen to make a window, a coach, a horse, church spire, or whale one of
 his <i>dramatis personæ</i> we must have it in some form, offensive as 
it is; the mistake which was his in so constructing the play is ours 
when we go to see it. In the old playbooks the “Scene—a Bridge in 
Venice,” “Scene—a Cottage in the Black Forest,” “Scene—a Battle Field,” 
etc., were not intended as instructions to the manager, but to the 
spectator. The author did not expect these things to be shown on the 
stage, but imagined in the auditorium. They were mere hints and helps to
 the imagination,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> which, as 
an artist, it was his business to stimulate and guide, and the modern 
playwright, as a fool, decrees it his duty to discourage and repress. 
The play should require as few accessories as possible, and to those 
actually required the manager should confine himself. We may grant 
Shakspeare his open grave in <i>Hamlet</i>, but the impertinence of real
 earth in it we should resent; while the obtrusion of adjacent tombs and
 headstones at large is a capital crime. If we endure a play in which a 
man is pitched out of a window we must perforce endure the window; but 
the cornice, curtains and tassels; the three or four similar windows 
with nobody pitched out of them; the ancestral portrait on the wall and 
the suit of armor in the niche; what have these to do with the matter? 
We can see them anywhere at any time; we wish to know how not to see 
them. They are of the vulgarities. They distract attention from the 
actor, and under cover of the diversion he plays badly. Is it any wonder
 that he does not care to compete with a gilt cornice and a rep sofa?</p>
<p>On the Athenian stage, a faulty gesture, a sin in rhetoric, a false 
quantity or accent—these were visited with the dire displeasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
 of an audience in whom the art-sense was sweeter than honey and 
stronger than a lion; an audience that went to the play to see the play,
 to discriminate, compare, mark the conformity of individual practice to
 universal principle: in a word, to criticise. They enjoyed that rarest 
and ripest of all pleasures, the use of trained imagination. There was 
the naked majesty of art, there the severe simplicity of taste. And 
there came not the carpenter with his machines, the upholsterer with his
 stuffs, nor the painter with blotches of impertinent color, crazing the
 eye and grieving the heart.</p>

<h3 id="THE_MATTER_OF_MANNER">THE MATTER OF MANNER</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">I&nbsp;HAVE sometimes fancied that a musical 
instrument retains among its capabilities and potentialities something 
of the character, some hint of the soul, some waiting echo from the life
 of each who has played upon it: that the violin which Paganini had 
touched was not altogether the same afterward as before, nor had quite 
so fine a fibre after some coarser spirit had stirred its strings. Our 
language is a less delicate instrument: it is not susceptible to a 
debasing contagion; it receives no permanent and essential impress but 
from the hand of skill. You may fill it with false notes, and these will
 speak discordant when invoked by a clumsy hand; but when the master 
plays they are all unheard—silent in the quickened harmonies of masters 
who have played before.</p>
<p>My design is to show in the lucidest way that I can the supreme 
importance of words, their domination of thought, their mastery of 
character. Had the Scriptures been translated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
 as literally as now, into the colloquial speech of the unlearned, and 
had the originals been thereafter inaccessible, only direct 
interposition of the Divine Power could have saved the whole edifice of 
Christianity from tumbling to ruin.</p>
<p>Max Muller distilled the results of a lifetime of study into two lines:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">No Language without Reason.</div>
<div class="i0">No Reason without Language.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The person with a copious and obedient vocabulary and the will and 
power to apply it with precision thinks great thoughts. The mere glib 
talker—who may have a meagre vocabulary and no sense of discrimination 
in the use of words—is another kind of creature. A nation whose language
 is strong and rich and flexible and sweet—such as English was just 
before the devil invented dictionaries—has a noble literature and, 
compared with contemporary nations barren in speech, a superior 
morality. A word is a crystallized thought; good words are precious 
possessions, which nevertheless, like gold, may be mischievously used. 
The introduction of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> bad 
word, its preservation, the customary misuse of a good one—these are 
sins affecting the public welfare. The fight against faulty diction is a
 fight against insurgent barbarism—a fight for high thinking and right 
living—for art, science, power—in a word, civilization. A motor without 
mechanism; an impulse without a medium of transmission; a vitalizing 
thought with no means to impart it; a fertile mind with a barren 
vocabulary—than these nothing could be more impotent. Happily they are 
impossible. They are not even conceivable.</p>
<p>Conduct is of character, character is of thought, and thought is 
unspoken speech. We think in words; we can not think without them. 
Shallowness or obscurity of speech means shallowness or obscurity of 
thought. Barring a physical infirmity, an erring tongue denotes an 
erring brain. When I stumble in my speech I stumble in my thought. Those
 who have naturally the richest and most obedient vocabulary are also 
the wisest thinkers; there is little worth knowing but what they have 
thought. The most brutish savage is he who is most meagrely equipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> with words; fill him with words to the top of his gift and you would make him as wise as he is able to become.</p>
<p>The man who can neither write well nor talk well would have us 
believe that, like the taciturn parrot of the anecdote, he is “a devil 
to think.” It is not so. Though such a man had read the Alexandrian 
library he would remain ignorant; though he had sat at the feet of Plato
 he would be still unwise. The gift of expression is the measure of 
mental capacity; its degree of cultivation is the exponent of 
intellectual power. One may choose not to utter one’s mind—that is 
another matter; but if he choose he can. He can utter it all. His mind, 
not his heart; his thought, not his emotion. And if he do not sometimes 
choose to utter he will eventually cease to think. A mind without 
utterance is like a lake without an outlet: though fed with mountain 
springs and unfailing rivers, its waters do not long keep sweet.</p>
<p>Human speech is an imperfect instrument—imperfect by reason of its 
redundancy, imperfect by reason of its poverty. We have too many words 
for our meaning, too many meanings for our words. The effect is so 
confusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> and embarrassing 
that the ability to express our thoughts with force and accuracy is 
extremely rare. It is not a gift, but a gift and an accomplishment. It 
comes not altogether by nature, but is achieved by hard, technical 
study.</p>
<p>In illustration of the poverty of speech take the English word 
“literature.” It means the art of writing and it means the things 
written—preferably in the former sense by him who has made it a study, 
almost universally in the latter by those who know nothing about it. 
Indeed, the most of these are unaware that it has another meaning, 
because unaware of the existence of the thing which in that sense it 
means. Tell them that literature, like painting, sculpture, music and 
architecture, is an art—the most difficult of arts—and you must expect 
an emphatic dissent. The denial not infrequently comes from persons of 
wide reading, even wide writing, for the popular writer commonly utters 
his ideas as, if he pursued the vocation for which he is better fitted, 
he would dump another kind of rubbish from another kind of cart—pull out
 the tailboard and let it go. The immortals have a different method.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>
<p>Among the minor trials of one who has a knowledge of the art of 
literature is the book of one who has not. It is a light affliction, for
 he need not read it. The worthy bungler’s conversation about the books 
of others is a sharper disaster, for it can not always be evaded and 
must be courteously endured; and, goodness gracious! how comprehensively
 he does not know! How eagerly he points out the bottomless abyss of his
 ignorance and leaps into it! The <i>censor literarum</i> is perhaps the most widely distributed species known to zoology.</p>
<p>The ignorance of the reading public and the writing public concerning
 literary art is the eighth wonder of the world. Even its rudiments are 
to these two great classes a thing that is not. From neither the talk of
 the one nor the writing of the other would a student from Mars ever 
learn, for illustration, that a romance is not a novel; that poetry is a
 thing apart from the metrical form in which it is most acceptable; that
 an epigram is not a truth tersely stated—is, in fact, not altogether 
true; that fable is neither story nor anecdote; that the speech of an 
illiterate doing the best he knows how is another thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
 than dialect; that prose has its prosody no less exacting than verse. 
The ready-made critic and the ready-made writer are two of a kind and 
each is good enough for the other. To both, writing is writing, and that
 is all there is of it. If we had two words for the two things now 
covered by the one word “literature” perhaps the benighted could be 
taught to distinguish between, not only the art and the product, but, 
eventually, the different kinds of the product itself. As it is, they 
are in much the same state of darkness as that of the Southern young 
woman before she went North and learned, to her astonishment, that the 
term “damned Yankee” was two words—she had never heard either without 
the other.</p>
<p>In literature, as in all art, manner is everything and matter 
nothing; I mean that matter, however important, has nothing to do with 
the <i>art</i> of literature; that is a thing apart. In literature it 
makes very little difference what you say, but a great deal how you say 
it. It is precisely this thing called style which determines and fixes 
the place of any written discourse; the thoughts may be the most 
interesting, the statements the most important,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
 that it is possible to conceive; yet if they be not cast in the 
literary mold, the world can not be persuaded to accept the work as 
literature. What could be more important and striking than the matter of
 Darwin’s books, or Spencer’s? Does anyone think of Darwin and Spencer 
as men of letters? Their manner, too, is admirable for its purpose—to 
convince. Conviction, though, is not a literary purpose. What can depose
 Sterne from literature? Yet who says less than Sterne, or says it 
better?</p>
<p>It is so in painting. One man makes a great painting of a sheepcote; 
another, a bad one of Niagara. The difference is not in the subject—in 
that the Niagara man has all the advantage; it is in the style. 
Art—literary, graphic, or what you will—is not a matter of matter, but a
 matter of manner. It is not the What but the How. The master enchants 
when writing of a pebble on the beach; the bungler wearies us with a 
storm at sea. Let the dullard look to his theme and thought; the artist 
sets down what comes. He pickles it sweet with a salt savor of verbal 
felicity, and it charms like Apollo’s lute.</p>
<hr class="chap">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
<h3 id="ON_READING_NEW_BOOKS">ON READING NEW BOOKS</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT is hereby confessed too—nay, affirmed—that this 
our time is as likely to produce great literary work as any of the ages 
that have gone before. There is no reason to suppose that the modern 
mind is any whit inferior in creative power to the ancient, albeit the 
moderns have not, as the ancients had, “the first rifling of the 
beauties of nature.” For our images, our metaphors, our similes and what
 not we must go a bit further afield than Homer had to go. We can no 
longer—at least we no longer should, though many there be who do—say “as
 red as blood,” “as white as snow,” and so forth. Our predecessors 
harvested that crop and threshed it out before we had the bad luck to be
 born. But much that was closed to them is open to us, for still 
creation widens to man’s view.</p>
<p>No; the <i>laudatores temporis acti</i> are not to be trusted when 
they say that the days of great literature are past. At any time a 
supreme genius may rise anywhere on the literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
 horizon and, flaming in the sky, splendor the world with a new glory. 
But the readers of new books need not put on colored spectacles to 
protect their eyes. It is not they that will recognize him. They will 
not be able to distinguish him from the little luminaries whose advent 
they are always “hailing” as the dawn of a new and wonderful day. It is 
unlikely, indeed, that he will be recognized at all in his own day for 
what he is. It may be that when he “swims into our ken” we shall none of
 us eye the blue vault and bless the useful light, but swear that it is a
 malign and baleful beam. Nay, worse, he may never be recognized by 
posterity. Great work in letters has no inherent quality, no innate 
vitality, that will necessarily preserve it long enough to demand 
judgment from those qualified by time to consider it without such 
distractions as the circumstances and conditions under which it was 
produced. And only so can a true judgment be given. It is likely that 
more great writers have died and been forever forgotten than have had 
their fame bruited about the world. Ah, well, they must take their 
chances. I, for my part, am not going to read dozens of the very newest 
books annually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> lest I 
overlook a genius now and then. Dozens are large numbers when it is 
books that one is talking about. Probably not so many worth reading were
 written in either half of the Nineteenth Century.</p>
<p>The reader of new books is in the position of one who, having at hand
 a mine of precious metals, easy of working and by his utmost diligence 
inexhaustible, suffers it to lie untouched and goes prospecting on the 
chance of finding another as good. He may find one, though the odds are a
 thousand to one that he will not. If he does, he will find also that he
 did not need to be in a hurry about it. Every book that is worth 
reading is founded on something permanent in human nature or the 
constitution of things, and constructed on principles of art which are 
themselves eternal. Whether it is read in one decade or another—even in 
one century or another—is of no importance; its value and charm are 
unchanging and unchangeable. Reverting to my simile of the mine, a good 
book is located on the great mother-lode of human interest; whereas the 
work that immediately prospers in the praise of the multitude commonly 
taps some “pocket” in the country rock and the accidental deposit is 
soon exhausted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>
<p>The world is full of great books in lettered languages. If any one 
has lived long enough, and read with sufficient assiduity, to have 
possessed his mind of all the literary treasures accessible to him; if 
he has mastered all the tongues in which are any masterworks of genius 
yet untranslated; if the ages have nothing more to offer him; if he has 
availed himself of the utmost advantages that he can derive from the 
infallible censorship of time and advice of the posterity which he calls
 his ancestors—let him commit himself to the blind guidance of chance, 
stand at the tail end of a modern press and devour as much of its daily 
output as he can. That will, at least, enable him to shine in a 
conversation; and the social <i>illuminati</i> whose achievements in 
that way are most admired will themselves assure you that such are the 
purpose and advantage of “literary culture”. And of all drawing-room 
authorities, he or she is most reverently esteemed who can most readily 
and accurately say what dullard wrote the latest and stupidest novel, 
but can not say why.</p>

<h3 id="ALPHABETES_AND_BORDER_RUFFIANS">ALPHABÊTES AND BORDER RUFFIANS</h3>
</div>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="drop-cap">IT is hoped that Divine Justice may find some 
suitable affliction for the malefactors who invent variations upon the 
letters of the alphabet of our fathers—our Roman fathers. Within the 
past thirty years our current literature has become a spectacle for the 
gods. The type-founder, worthy mechanic, has asserted himself with an 
overshadowing individuality, defacing with his monstrous creations and 
revivals every publication in the land. Everywhere secret, black and 
midnight wags are diligently studying the alphabet to see how many of 
the letters are susceptible to mutation into something new and strange. 
Some of the letters are more tractable than others: the O, for example, 
can be made as little as you please and set as far above the line as 
desired, with or without a flyspeck in the center or a dash (straight or
 curved) below. Why should one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
 think that O looks better when thrown out of relation to the other 
letters when Heaven has given him eyes to see that it does not?</p>
<p>Then there is the M—the poor M, who for his distinction as the 
biggest toad in the alphabetical puddle is subjected to so dreadful 
though necessary indignity in typoscript—the wanton barbarity of his 
treatment by the type-founders makes one blush for civilization, or at 
least wish for it. There are two schools of M-sters; when their warfare 
is accomplished we shall know whether that letter is to figure 
henceforth as two sides of a triangle or three sides of a square. In A 
the ruffians have an easy victim; they can put his cross-bar up or down 
at will; it does not matter, so that it is put where it was not. For it 
must be understood that all these alterations are made with no thought 
of beauty: the sole purpose of the ruffians is to make the letters, as 
many as possible of them, different from what they were before. That is 
true generally, but not universally: in the titles of books and weekly 
newspapers, and on the covers of magazines, there is frequently an 
obvious revival, not merely of archaic forms, but of crude and primitive
 printing, as if from wooden blocks. Doubtless it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
 beautiful, but it does not look so. In our time the reversionaries have
 so far prevailed against common sense that in several periodicals the 
long-waisted s is restored, and we have a renewal of the scandalous 
relations between the c and the t.</p>
<p>The most fantastic and grotesque of these reversions (happily it has 
not yet affected the text of our daily reading) is the restoration of 
the ancient form of U, which is now made a V again. This would seem to 
be bad enough, but it appears that it has not sated the passion for 
change; so the V also has again become a U! What advantage is got by the
 transposition those who make it have not condescended to explain. 
Altogether the unhappy man who conceives himself obliged to read the 
literature of the day—especially the part that shouts and screams in 
titles and catalogues, headlines, and so forth—may justly claim 
remission of punishment in the next world, so poignant are his 
sufferings in this.</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>Coincidently in point of time with these indisposing pranks, came in,
 and has remained in, a companion-fad of the artists who illustrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
 newspapers, magazines and books. These probably well-meaning but most 
undesirable persons, who could be spared by even the most unsparing 
critic, are affected with a weakness for borders to pictures. By means 
of borders—borders rectangular, borders triangular, borders circular, 
borders omniform and nulliform they can put pictures into pictures, like
 cards in a loose pack, stick pictures through pictures, and so confuse,
 distract and bewilder the attention that it turns its back upon the 
display, occupying itself with the noble simplicity and naturalness of 
the wish that all artists were at the devil. Nor are they satisfied with
 all that: they must make pictures of pictures by showing an irrelevant 
background outside their insupportable borders; by representing their 
pictures as depending from hooks; nailed upon the walls; spitted on 
pins, and variously served right. And still they are not happy: the 
picture must, upon occasion, transgress its border—a mast, a steeple, or
 a tree thrust through and rejoicing in its escape; an ocean spilling 
over and taking to its heels as hard as ever it can hook it. The taste 
that accepts this fantastic nonsense is creature to the taste that 
supplies it; in an age and country having any sense of the seriousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> of art the taste could not exist long enough to outlast its victim’s examination on a charge of lunacy.</p>
<p>No picture should have a border; that has no use, no meaning, and 
whatever beauty is given to it the picture pays for through the nose. It
 is what may be called a contemporary survival: it stands for the frame 
of a detached picture—a picture on a wall. The frame is necessary for 
support and protection; but an illustration, like the female of the 
period, needs neither protection nor support, and the border would give 
none if it were needed. It is an impertinence without a mandate; its 
existence is due to unceasing suggestions flowing from the frames into 
heads where there is plenty of room.</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p>Apropos of illustrations and illustrators, I should like to ask what 
is the merit or meaning of that peculiar interpretation of nature which 
consists in representing men and women with white clothing and black 
faces and hands. I do not say that it is not sufficiently realistic—that
 it is too conventional; I only “want to know.” I should like to know, 
too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> if in illustrating, 
say, a football match in Ujiji the gentlemen addicted to that method 
here would show the players in black clothing, with white faces and 
hands? Or in default of clothing would they be shown white all over? If 
anybody can endarken my lightness on this subject I shall be glad to 
hear from him. I am groping in a noonday of doubt and plunged in a gulf 
of white despair.</p>
<p>Possibly these pictures are called silhouettes—I have heard them 
called so. Possibly if they were silhouettes they would be acceptable, 
for the genius of a Kanewka may lift the spectator above such 
considerations as right and left in the matter of legs and arms. But 
they are not silhouettes; the faces and hands are in shadow, the 
clothing in light. The figures are like Tennyson’s lotus eaters: 
“between the sun and moon”; the former has power upon the skin only, the
 latter upon the apparel. The spectator is supposed to be upon the same 
side as the moon. That is where the artist is. He draws the figures, the
 moon draws him, and I draw a veil over the affecting scene.</p>

<h3 id="TO_TRAIN_A_WRITER">TO TRAIN A WRITER</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THERE is a good deal of popular ignorance about 
writing; it is commonly thought that good writing comes of a natural 
gift and that without the gift the trick can not be turned. This is true
 of great writing, but not of good. Any one with good natural 
intelligence and a fair education can be taught to write well, as he can
 be taught to draw well, or play billiards well, or shoot a rifle well, 
and so forth; but to do any of these things greatly is another matter. 
If one can not do great work it is worth while to do good work and think
 it great.</p>
<p>I have had some small experience in teaching English composition, and
 some of my pupils are good enough to permit me to be rather proud of 
them. Some I have been able only to encourage, and a few will recall my 
efforts to profit them by dissuasion. I should not now think it worth 
while to teach a pupil to write merely well, but given one capable of 
writing greatly, and five years in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
 which to train him, I should not permit him to put pen to paper for at 
least two of them—except to make notes. Those two years should be given 
to broadening and strengthening his mind, teaching him how to think and 
giving him something to think about—to sharpening his faculties of 
observation, dispelling his illusions and destroying his ideals. That 
would hurt: he would sometimes rebel, doubtless, and have to be subdued 
by a diet of bread and water and a poem on the return of our heroes from
 Santiago.</p>
<p>If I caught him reading a newly published book, save by way of 
penance, it would go hard with him. Of our modern education he should 
have enough to read the ancients: Plato, Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, 
Seneca and that lot—custodians of most of what is worth knowing. He 
might retain what he could of the higher mathematics if he had been so 
prodigal of his time as to acquire any, and might learn enough of 
science to make him prefer poetry; but to learn from Euclid that the 
three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles, yet not to 
learn from Epictetus how to be a worthy guest at the table of the gods, 
would be accounted a breach of contract.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>
<p>But chiefly this fortunate youth with the brilliant future should 
learn to take comprehensive views, hold large convictions and make wide 
generalizations. He should, for example, forget that he is an American 
and remember that he is a Man. He should be neither Christian, nor Jew, 
nor Buddhist, nor Mahometan, nor Snake Worshiper. To local standards of 
right and wrong he should be civilly indifferent. In the virtues, 
so-called, he should discern only the rough notes of a general 
expediency; in fixed moral principles only time-saving predecisions of 
cases not yet before the court of conscience. Happiness should disclose 
itself to his enlarging intelligence as the end and purpose of life; art
 and love as the only means to happiness. He should free himself of all 
doctrines, theories, etiquettes, politics, simplifying his life and 
mind, attaining clarity with breadth and unity with height. To him a 
continent should not seem wide, nor a century long. And it would be 
needful that he know and have an ever present consciousness that this is
 a world of fools and rogues, blind with superstition, tormented with 
envy, consumed with vanity, selfish, false, cruel, cursed with 
illusions—frothing mad!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>
<p>We learn in suffering what we teach in song—and prose. I should pray 
that my young pupil would occasionally go wrong, experiencing the 
educational advantages of remorse; that he would dally with some of the 
more biting vices. I should be greatly obliged if Fortune would lay upon
 him, now and then, a heavy affliction. A bereavement or two, for 
example, would be welcome, although I should not care to have a hand in 
it. He must have joy, too—O, a measureless exuberance of joy; and hate, 
and fear, hope, despair and love—love inexhaustible, a permanent 
provision. He must be a sinner and in turn a saint, a hero, a wretch. 
Experiences and emotions—these are necessaries of the literary life. To 
the great writer they are as indispensable as sun and air to the rose, 
or good, fat, edible vapors to toads. When my pupil should have had two 
years of this he would be permitted to try his ’prentice hand at a pig 
story in words of one syllable. And I should think it very kind and 
friendly if Mr. George Sylvester Vierick would consent to be the pig.</p>

<h3 id="AS_TO_CARTOONING">AS TO CARTOONING</h3>
</div>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="drop-cap">I&nbsp;WISH that the American artists whose lot is 
cast in the pleasant domain of caricature would learn something of the 
charm of moderation and the strength of restraint. Their “cartoons” 
yell; one looks at them with one’s fingers in one’s ears.</p>
<p>Did you ever observe and consider the dragon in Chinese art? With 
what an awful ferocity it is endowed by its creator—the expanded mouth 
with its furniture of curling tongue and impossible teeth, its big, 
fiery eyes, scaly body, huge claws and spiny back! All the horrible 
qualities the artist knows he lavishes upon this pet of his imagination.
 The result is an animal which one rather wishes to meet and would not 
hesitate to cuff. Unrestricted exaggeration has defeated its own purpose
 and made ludicrous what was meant to be terrible. That is, the artist 
has lacked the strength of restraint. A true artist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
 could so represent the common domestic bear, or the snake of the field,
 as to smite the spectator with a nameless dread. He could do so by 
merely giving to the creature’s eye an expression of malevolence which 
would need no assistance from claw, fang or posture.</p>
<p>The American newspaper cartoonist errs in an infantile way similar to
 that of the Chinese; by intemperate exaggeration he fails of his 
effect. His men are not men at all, so it is impossible either to 
respect or detest them, or to feel toward them any sentiment whatever. 
As well try to evoke a feeling for or against a wooden Indian, a 
butcher’s-block, or a young lady’s favorite character in fiction. His 
deformed and distorted creations are entirely outside the range of human
 sympathy, antipathy, or interest. They are not even amusing. They are 
disgusting and, as in the case of foul names, the object of the disgust 
which they inspire is not the person vilified, but the person vilifying.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am not the average reader, but it is a fact that I 
frequently read an entire newspaper page of which one of these cartoons 
is the most conspicuous object, without once glancing at the picture’s 
title or observing what it is all about. I have the same unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> reluctance to see it that I have to see anything else offensive.</p>
<p>I once sat reading a Republican newspaper. The whole upper half of 
the page consisted of a cartoon by a well-known artist. It represented 
Mr. Bryan, the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, standing on his 
head in a crowd (which I think he would do if it would make him 
President, and I don’t know that it would not) but I did not then 
observe it. The artist himself sat near by, narrowly watching me, which I
 did observe. A little while after I had laid down the paper he said 
carelessly: “O, by the way, what do you think of my cartoon of Bryan 
with his heels in the air?” And—Heaven help me!—I replied that I had 
been a week out of town and had not seen the newspapers!</p>
<p>A peculiarity of American caricature is that few of its “masters” 
know how to draw. They are like our great “humorists,” who are nearly 
all men of little education and meagre reading. As soon as they have 
prospered, got a little polish and some knowledge of books, they cease 
to be “humorists.”</p>
<p>One of the most popular of the “cartoonists” knows so little of anatomy that in most of his work the human arm is a fourth too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
 short, and seems to be rapidly dwindling to a pimple; and so little of 
perspective that in a certain cartoon one of his figures was leaning 
indolently against a column about ten feet from where he stood.</p>
<p>A fashion has recently come in among the comic artists of getting 
great fun out of the lower forms of life. They have discovered and 
developed a mine of humor in the beasts and the birds, the reptiles, 
fishes and insects. Some of the things they make them say and do are 
really amusing. But here is where they all go wrong and spoil their 
work: they put upon these creatures some article of human attire—boots, a
 coat or a hat. They make them carry umbrellas and walking-sticks. They 
put a lightning rod on a bird’s nest, a latch on a squirrel-hole in a 
tree, and supply a beehive with a stovepipe. Why? They don’t know why; 
they have a vague feeling that incongruity is witty, or that to outfit 
an animal with human appurtenances brings it, somehow, closer to one’s 
bosom and business. The effect is otherwise.</p>
<p>When you have drawn your cow with a skirt she has not become a woman,
 and is no longer a cow. She is nothing that a sane taste can feel an 
interest in. An animal, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> 
any living thing, in its natural state—is always interesting. Some 
animals we know to have the sense of humor and all probably have 
language; so in making them do and say funny things, even if their 
speech has to be translated into ours, there is nothing unnatural, 
incongruous or offensive. But a cat in a shirtwaist, a rabbit with a 
gun—ah, me!</p>
<p>Obviously it is futile to say anything to those “dragons of the 
prime” who draw the combination map-and-picture—the map whereon cities 
are represented by clusters of buildings, each cluster extending half 
way to the next. It would be useless to protest that these horrible 
things are neither useful as maps nor pleasing as pictures. They 
are—well, to put it quite plainly, they sicken. Sometimes the savages 
who draw them sketch-in a regiment or so of soldiers—this in “war-maps” 
of course—whose height is about five miles each, except that of the 
commander, which is ten. And if there is a bit of sea the villain who 
draws it will show us a ship two hundred miles long, commonly sailing up
 hill or down. It is useless to remonstrate against this kind of thing. 
The men guilty of it are little further advanced intellectually than the
 worthy cave-dweller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> who has
 left us his masterpieces scratched on rocks and the shoulder blades of 
victims of his appetite—the illustrious inventor of the six-legged 
mammoth and the feathered pig.</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>When in the course of human events I shall have been duly instated as
 head of the art department of an American newspaper, a decent respect 
for the principles of my trade will compel me to convene my cartoonists 
and utter the hortatory remarks here following:</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, you will be pleased to understand some of the limitations
 of your art, for therein lies the secret of efficiency. To know and 
respect one’s limitations, not seeking to transcend them, but ever to 
occupy the entire area of activity which they bound—that is to 
accomplish all that it is given to man to do. Your limitations are of 
two kinds: those inconsiderable ones imposed by nature, and the less 
negligible ones for which you will have to thank the tyrant that has the
 honor to address you.</p>
<p>“Your first and highest duty, of course, is to afflict the Eminent 
Unworthy. To the service of that high purpose I invite you with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
 effusion, but shall limit you to a single method—ridicule. You may not 
do more than make them absurd. Happily that is the sharpest affliction 
that Heaven has given them the sensibility to feel. When one is 
conscious of being ridiculous one experiences an incomparable and 
immedicable woe. Ridicule is the capital punishment of the unwritten 
law.</p>
<p>“I shall not raise the question of your natural ability to make an 
offender hateful, but only say that it is not permitted to you to do so 
in this paper. The reason should be obvious: you can not make him 
hateful without making a hateful picture, and a paper with hateful 
pictures is a hateful paper. Some of you, I am desolated to point out, 
have at times sinned so grievously as to make the victim—or attempt to 
make him—not only hateful but offensive, not only offensive but 
loathsome. Result: hateful, offensive, loathsome cartoons, imparting 
their unpleasant character to the paper containing them; for the 
contents of a paper are the paper.</p>
<p>“And, after all, this folly fails of its purpose—does not make its 
subject offensive. An eminently unworthy person—a political ‘boss,’ a 
‘king of finance,’ or a ‘gray wolf of the Senate’—is a man of normal 
appearance;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> his face, his 
figure, his postures, are those of the ordinary human being. In the 
attempt to make him offensive the caricaturist’s art of exaggeration is 
carried to such an extreme as to remove the victim from the domain of 
human interest. The loathing inspired by the impossible creation is not 
transferred to the person so candidly misrepresented; the picture is 
made offensive, but its subject is untouched. As well try to hate a 
faulty triangle, a house upside down, a vacuum, or an abracadabra. Let 
there be surcease of so mischievous work; it is not desired that this 
paper shall be prosperous in spite of its artists, but partly because of
 them.</p>
<p>“True, to make a man ridiculous you must make a ridiculous picture, 
but a ridiculous picture is not displeasing. If well done, with only the
 needful, that is to say artistic, exaggeration, it is pleasing. We like
 to laugh, but we do not like—pardon me—to retch. The only person 
pleased by an offensive cartoon is its author; the only person pained by
 a ridiculous one is its victim.”</p>

<h3 id="THE_S_P_W">THE S. P. W.</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">WILL not some Christian gentleman of leisure have 
the benevolence to organize The Society for the Protection of Writers? 
Its work will be mainly educational; not much permanent good can be 
done, I fear, by assassination, though as an auxiliary means, that may 
be worthy of consideration. The public must be led to understand, each 
individual in his own way, that some part of a writer’s time belongs to 
himself and has a certain value to him. If the experience of other 
writers equally ill known is the same as mine the sum of our wrongs is 
something solemn. Everybody, it would seem, feels at liberty to request a
 writer to do whatever the wild and wanton requester may wish to have 
done—to criticise (commend) a manuscript; send his photograph, or a copy
 of his latest book; write poetry in an album forwarded for the purpose 
and already well filled with unearthly sentiments by demons of the pit;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
 set down a few rules for writing well, and so forth. It is God’s truth 
that compliance with one-half of the “requests” made of me would leave 
me no time for my meals, and no meals for my time.</p>
<p>Of course I speak of strangers—persons without the shadow of a claim 
to my time and attention, and with very little to those of their 
heavenly Father. Indeed, they belong, as a rule, to a class that is more
 profited by escaping divine attention than by courting it: nothing 
should so fill them with consternation as a glance from the All-seeing 
Eye—though some of the finer and freer spirits of their bright band 
would think nothing of inviting the Recording Angel to forsake his 
accounts and scratch an appropriate sentiment on “the enclosed 
headstone.”</p>
<p>When Mr. Rudyard Kipling once visited Montreal he gave orders at his 
hotel that he was not to be disturbed—whereby many worthy persons who 
called to “pay their respects” were sadly disappointed. One “prominent 
merchant,” a “great admirer,” took the trouble to introduce himself, and
 had the infelicitous fate to be informed by Mr. Kipling that he did not
 wish any new acquaintances—and sorrow perched upon that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
 man’s prominent soul. To a club of “literary” folk and “artists” who 
“tendered him a reception” he did not deign a reply; and those whose 
hope construed his silence as assent were made acquainted with the taste
 of their own teeth. In short, Mr. Kipling seems to have acted in 
Montreal very much like a modest gentleman desiring to be let alone and 
having a gentleman’s fine scorn of vulgarity and intrusion.</p>
<p>When, I wonder, will Americans—Canadian Americans and United States 
Americans—learn that their admiration of a man’s work in letters or art 
gives them no right to occupy his time and lengthen the always 
intolerably long muster-roll of his acquaintance? One would think that 
so wholesome a lesson in manners as Dickens gave us during his first 
visit, and later in the <i>American Notes</i> and <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>,
 would suffice, and that for lack of students he would have no successor
 in the Chair of Deportment. But sycophancy, like hope, springs eternal 
in the human breast, and, crushed to earth, impudence like truth, will 
rise again, inviting a fresh humiliation. Well, as the homely proverb 
hath it, there is no great loss without some small gain—albeit the same 
usually accrues to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> the 
author of the loss. Montreal’s Pen and Pencil Club having passed through
 the fire and been purified of its own respect, is now, by that 
privation and the affining stress of a common sorrow, fitted to 
affiliate with the Bohemian Club of San Francisco, which also knows the 
lift of the Kipling superior lip, and how he kipples.</p>
<p>Mr. Kipling’s explanation that he did not desire any new 
acquaintances goes pretty nearly to the root of the matter. What man of 
sense does?—unless he is so ghastly unfortunate as to need them in his 
business. A man of brains has commonly a better use for his head than to
 make it serve as a rogues’ gallery for an interminable succession of 
mental portraits, each of which he must be prepared to outfit with its 
appropriate name on demand. One can not, of course, and none but a fool 
would wish to, go through life without now and again making an 
acquaintance, even a friendship, as circumstances, civility and 
character may determine. Even chance may without absolutely uniform 
disaster play a part in such matters, though, as a rule, persons in 
whose lives accidental meetings entail lasting social relations are not 
particularly agreeable to meet. Your man of sense cares to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
 those whom he daily meets under such circumstances as would make it 
awkward if he did not know them; and he is accessible to all good souls 
whose wish to know him is supplemented by the frankness to ask an 
introduction and the civility to obtain his assent. It is thus that he 
will himself approach those whom he wishes to know, and in some cases 
those whom he merely suspects of the wish to know him. As to that 
invention of the devil, the purposeless and meaningless “chance 
introduction,” it is the hatefulest thing in all the wild welter of 
social irritants. As a claim to acquaintance it has about the same 
validity as had, in the case of Kipling, the fact that Montreal’s 
“prominent merchant” was a “great admirer.”</p>
<p>If a man, like a red worm, could be multiplied by section he might 
perhaps undertake to know all whom the irritating freedom of American 
manners permits to be introduced to him, and, if he is a distinguished 
writer, all who “greatly admire” him. At least if they were properly 
brigaded he might undertake to commit to his multiplied memory the names
 or numerals of the several brigades. Even then it should be understood 
that failure through preoccupation with his own affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
 should not be counted against him as proof of pride and an evil 
disposition. Some allowance should be made, too, for the probability 
that a man of letters may be unfitted for prodigious feats of 
recollection by the necessity of preserving some part of his time for 
use in—well, for example, in letters. As to “receptions,” “banquets,” 
and so forth, “tendered” him, and “calls” “paid” him by strangers not of
 his profession, unless he is a literary impostor he will not accept the
 hospitality, nor, unless he is a social coward, submit to the 
intrusion. He knows that beneath these dreary and dispiriting 
“attentions” are motives transcending in ugliness a tangle of snakes 
under a warm rock.</p>
<p>There are other reasons why men of letters are not usually hot to 
make acquaintances. A good writer is a man of thought, for good writing,
 whatever else it may be, is, first of all, clear thinking. However much
 or little of his actual opinions he may choose to put into his work, he
 necessarily, as a man of thought, has convictions not commonly 
entertained by “persons whom one meets”—when one must. He is likely to 
be a dissenter from the established order of things—to hold in scant 
esteem the institutions, faiths, laws,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
 customs, habits, morals and manners that are the natural outgrowth and 
expression of our barbarous race; the enactments of God’s governing 
majority, the rogues and fools. To utter his views in conversation with 
Philistines and Prudes is to smite them sick with dismay and fill them 
topful of resentment and antagonism; to incite a contention in which the
 appurtenant stalled ox itself is imperiled in the bones of it. Yet in 
making the acquaintance of even a fairly educated person not a vulgarian
 and having no outward and visible signs of an inner disgrace the 
chances are ten to one that you are meeting a Philistine and prude by 
whom natural conduct and rational convictions are accounted immoral, and
 with whom conversation outside the worn ways of commonplace and 
platitude is impossible. If it is a woman she will probably insult you, 
all unconsciously, in a thousand and fifty ways by savage scruples 
inherited from a long line of pithecan ancestresses eared to hear in the
 rustle of every leaf the tonguefall of the arboreal Mrs. Grundy. If it 
is a man there should be no needless delay in insulting <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>Another imminent peril to him who travels the hard road of letters 
lies in the mad desire and iron resolution of his new acquaintances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
 to talk about his work, with, of course, imperfect knowledge, 
understanding and discretion. This if he will not permit he is accounted
 proud; if he will, vain. Poor Hawthorne’s experience with the worthy 
person who thought it the proper thing to make a graceful reference to 
his book, “The Red Letter A,” is typical and the record of that dreadful
 encounter comes home to every author’s bosom and business with a 
peculiar personal interest.</p>

<h3 id="PORTRAITS_OF_ELDERLY_AUTHORS">PORTRAITS OF ELDERLY AUTHORS</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IF by good or much writing a modest old man have the
 misfortune to incur the curiosity of the public regarding his personal 
appearance, how shall he gratify it—and gratified it will somehow 
be—with the least distress to himself? Every public writer is familiar 
with the demand, from editor or publisher, “Please send photograph.” Of 
course he may easily decline, but also, alas! editor or publisher may 
easily decline the work for embellishment or advertisement of which the 
photograph was sought. So what can the poor man do? And what photograph 
shall he send—that of yesteryear, or that of a decade or two ago? 
Concerning this singularly solemn matter I venture to quote from a 
letter of one who conducts an editorium:</p>
<p>“One sees the printed counterfeit of a dashing young chap whom all know as the distinguished author of ‘The Bean Pot,’ which, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
 is true, appeared twenty years ago. But the portrait is the familiar 
one always used by publishers to herald later books by the same author. 
One day the author himself calls. You have always thought of him as 
having a smooth, high brow topped with a fine cluster of coal-black 
curls, and the devil in his eyes. When this wrinkled, bald, and squeaky 
old man tells you that he is the author of ‘The Bean Pot’ you suffer a 
shock. All your self-restraint is invoked to inhibit contumelious word 
and inhospitable act.”</p>
<p>True, O king, but there is more to the matter. Every writer that is 
fore and fit cherishes a natural expectation of being known to 
posterity. If that hope is fulfilled he will be known to posterity by 
his last portrait. Who knows Bryant, Longfellow, Whittier, Holmes or 
Whitman as other than a venerable ruin? Who has in mind a middle-aged 
Hugo, or a young Goethe? It is with an effort that we grasp the fact 
that all these excellent gentlemen of letters were not born old. They 
were merely indiscreet; they sat for their portraits when they could no 
longer stand. By the happy mischance of early death, Byron, Shelley, 
Keats and Poe escaped the caricaturing of the years, and can snap their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> finger-bones at Age, the merciless cartoonist.</p>
<p>The portrait of twenty years ago no more faultily represents the old 
man as he is than that of yesterday represents him as he was. Either is 
false to some period of his life, and he may reasonably enough prefer 
that posterity shall know how he looked in his prime, rather than that 
his contemporaries shall know how he looked in his decay. It may be that
 it was in his prime that he did the characteristic work that begot the 
desire to know him.</p>
<p>With what portrait, then, shall one well stricken in years meet the 
contemporary demand? Perhaps it is best, and not unfair, to supply it 
with one made in one’s prime, conscientiously and conspicuously 
inscribed with its date—and that is what I have usually done myself. But
 I grieve to observe that the date is, as a rule, ingeniously effaced in
 the reproduction. But what does posterity find that is peculiarly 
pleasing in the portrait of a patient in the last stage of his fatal 
disorder?</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IF without the faculty of observation one could acquire a thorough knowledge of literature, the <i>art</i>
 of literature, one would be astonished to learn “by report divine” how 
few professional writers can distinguish between one kind of writing and
 another. The difference between description and narration, that between
 a thought and a feeling, between poetry and verse, and so forth—all 
this is commonly imperfectly understood, even by most of those who work 
fairly well by intuition.</p>
<p>The ignorance of this sort that is most general is that of the 
distinction between wit and humor, albeit a thousand times expounded by 
impartial observers having neither. Now, it will be found that, as a 
rule, a shoemaker knows calfskin from sole-leather and a black-smith can
 tell you wherein forging a clevis differs from shoeing a horse. He will
 tell you that it is his business to know such things, so he knows them.
 Equally and manifestly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> it 
is a writer’s business to know the difference between one kind of 
writing and another kind, but to writers generally that advantage seems 
to be denied: they deny it to themselves.</p>
<p>I was once asked by a rather famous author why we laugh at wit. I 
replied: “We don’t—at least those of us who understand it do not.” Wit 
may make us smile, or make us wince, but laughter—that is the cheaper 
price that we pay for an inferior entertainment, namely, humor. There 
are persons who will laugh at anything at which they think they are 
expected to laugh. Having been taught that anything funny is witty, 
these benighted persons naturally think that anything witty is funny.</p>
<p>Who but a clown would laugh at the maxims of Rochefoucauld, which are
 as witty as anything written? Take, for example, this hackneyed 
epigram: “There is something in the misfortunes of our friends which we 
find not entirely displeasing”—I translate from memory. It is an 
indictment of the whole human race; not altogether true and therefore 
not altogether dull, with just enough of audacity to startle and just 
enough of paradox to charm, profoundly wise, as bleak as steel—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> a piece of ideal wit, as admirable as a well cut grave or the headsman’s precision of stroke, and about as funny.</p>
<p>Take Rabelais’ saying that an empty stomach has no ears. How 
pitilessly it displays the primitive beast alurk in us all and moved to 
activity by our elemental disorders, such as the daily stress of hunger!
 Who could laugh at the horrible disclosure, yet who forbear to smile 
approval of the deftness with which the animal is unjungled?</p>
<p>In a matter of this kind it is easier to illustrate than to define. 
Humor (which is not inconsistent with pathos, so nearly allied are 
laughter and tears) is Charles Dickens; wit is Alexander Pope. Humor is 
Dogberry; wit is Mercutio. Humor is “Artemus Ward,” “John Phoenix,” 
“Josh Billings,” “Petroleum V. Nasby,” “Orpheus C. Kerr,” “Bill” Nye, 
“Mark Twain”—their name is legion; for wit we must brave the perils of 
the deep: it is “made in France” and hardly bears transportation. Nearly
 all Americans are humorous; if any are born witty, Heaven help them to 
emigrate! You shall not meet an American and talk with him two minutes 
but he will say something humorous; in ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
 days he will say nothing witty; and if he did, your own, O most witty 
of all possible readers, would be the only ear that would give it 
recognition. Humor is tolerant, tender; its ridicule caresses. Wit 
stabs, begs pardon—and turns the weapon in the wound. Humor is a sweet 
wine, wit a dry; we know which is preferred by the connoisseur. They may
 be mixed, forming an acceptable blend. Even Dickens could on rare 
occasions blend them, as when he says of some solemn ass that his ears 
have reached a rumor.</p>
<p>My conviction is that while wit is a universal tongue (which few, however, can speak) humor is everywhere a <i>patois</i>
 not “understanded of the people” over the province border. The best 
part of it—its “essential spirit and uncarnate self,” is indigenous, and
 will not flourish in a foreign soil. The humor of one race is in some 
degree unintelligible to another race, and even in transit between two 
branches of the same race loses something of its flavor. To the American
 mind, for example, nothing can be more dreary and dejecting than an 
English comic paper; yet there is no reason to doubt that <i>Punch</i> and <i>Judy</i> and the rest of them have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> done much to dispel the gloom of the Englishman’s brumous environment and make him realize his relationship to Man.</p>
<p>It may be urged that the great English humorists are as much read in 
this country as in their own; that Dickens, for example, has long “ruled
 as his demesne” the country which had the unhappiness to kindle the 
fires of contempt in him and Rudyard Kipling; that “the excellent Mr. 
Twain” has a large following beyond the Atlantic. This is true enough, 
but I am convinced that while the American enjoys his Dickens with 
sincerity, the gladness of his soul is a tempered emotion compared with 
that which riots in the immortal part of John Bull when that singular 
instrument feels the touch of the same master. That a jest of Mark Twain
 ever got itself all inside the four corners of an English understanding
 is a proposition not lightly to be accepted without hearing counsel.</p>

<h3 id="WORD_CHANGES_AND_SLANG">WORD CHANGES AND SLANG</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THAT respectable words lose caste, becoming the 
yellow dogs and very lepers of language, is a familiar fact hospitable 
to abundant illustration. One of these words has just fallen from my 
pen; fifty or a hundred years from now it will be impossible, probably, 
for any writer having a decent regard to the value of words to use the 
word “respectable” of anything truly meriting respect. For the past 
half-century it has been taking on a new and opprobrious character. 
Already the type of the “respectable” man, for example, is the 
prosperous, wool-witted Philistine, who complacently interlocks his fat 
fingers under the overhang of his stomach, and surveying the world from 
the eminence of his own esteem, tries vainly to imagine what it would be
 without him.</p>
<p>The word “respectable” is indubitably doomed: etymology can not save 
it, any more than it could save the word “miscreant,” which means by 
derivation, as at one time it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
 meant actually, infidel, unbeliever. In its present abasement we may 
hear a faint, far whisper of the old, old days of religious intolerance.
 It stands in modern speech a verbal monument to the <i>odium theologicum</i> reposing beneath in the sure and certain hope of a blessed resurrection.</p>
<p>A half-century ago the word “awful” was plumped into the mire of 
slang, where it has weltered ever since, without actual immersion, but 
apparently with no hope of extrication. The writer who would use it 
to-day in a serious sense has need to be well assured of his hold upon 
the reader’s mood. It may perchance whisk that person away from the 
sublime to the ridiculous, with the neat-handed nimbleness of Satan 
snatching a soul from the straight and narrow way, to send it spinning 
aslant into the red-and-black billows of everlasting damnation!</p>
<p>There are transformations of a contrary sort—promotions and 
elevations of words, as from slang to poetry. Between the extremes of 
speech which are the extremes of thought, for speech is thought—between 
the upper and the lower deep, the heaven and the earth, is a 
Jacob’s-ladder which these winged messengers of mind ascend and descend.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>
<p>Grave advocacy of slang is not lacking: Professor Manley, of Harvard,
 is afield in defence of it. Some slang, he justly says, is “strong and 
poetical.” It is “strong” because graphic and vivid, “poetical” because 
metaphorical; for the life and soul of poetry is metaphor.</p>
<p>Professor Manley thinks that the story of the Prodigal Son could have been better told this way:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>The world gave him the marble heart, but his father extended the glad hand.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Yes, if those phrases had then been first used professors of 
literature might, as he suggests, be now expatiating on the beautiful 
simplicity of the diction and bewailing the inferiority of modern 
speech. But that is no defence of slang. It would not have been slang, 
any more than avowed or manifest quotations from the Scriptures as we 
have them are slang.</p>
<p>Professor Manley is especially charmed with the phrase “bats in his 
belfry,” and would indubitably substitute it for “possessed of a devil,”
 the Scriptural diagnosis of insanity. I don’t think the good man meant 
to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> irreverent, but I should not care for his Revised Edition.</p>
<p>Somewhat more than a generation ago John Camden Hotten, of London, a 
publisher of “rare and curious books,” put out a slang dictionary. Its 
editor-in-chief was that accomplished scholar, George Augustus Sala. It 
was afterward revised by Henry Sampson, famous later as an authority in 
matters of sport, to whom I gave such assistance as my little learning 
and no sportsmanship permitted. The volume was a thick one, but 
contained little that in this country and period we know (and suffer) as
 “slang.” Slang, as the word was then used, is defined in the <i>Century Dictionary</i> thus: “The cant words or jargon used by thieves, peddlers, beggars, and the vagabond classes generally.”</p>
<p>To-day we mean by it something different and more offensive. It is no longer the <i>argot</i>
 of criminals and semi-criminals, “whom one does not meet,” and whose 
distance—when they keep it—lends a certain enchantment to the ear, but 
the intolerable diction of more or less worthy persons who obey all laws
 but those of taste. In its present generally accepted meaning the word 
is thus defined by the authority already quoted: “Colloquial words and 
phrases which have originated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
 the cant or rude speech of the vagabond or unlettered classes, or, 
belonging in form to standard speech, have acquired or have had given 
them restricted, capricious, or extravagantly metaphorical meanings, and
 are regarded as vulgar or inelegant.”</p>
<p>It is not altogether comprehensible how a sane intelligence can 
choose to utter itself in that kind of speech, yet speech of that kind 
seems almost to be driving good English out of popular use. Among large 
classes of our countrymen, it is held in so high esteem that whole books
 of it are put upon the market with profit to author and publisher. One 
of the most successful of these, reprinted from many of our leading 
newspapers, is called, I think, <i>Fables in Slang</i>—containing, by 
the way, nothing that resembles a fable. This unspeakable stuff made its
 author rich, and naturally he “syndicated” a second series of the same.
 Another was entitled <i>Love Sonnets of a Hoodlum</i>, and contained 
not a line of clean English. And it is hardly an exaggeration to say 
that in this country the writing of humorous and satirical verse is a 
lost art; slang has taken the place of wit; the jest that smacks not of 
the slum finds no prosperity in any ear.</p>
<p>Slang has as many hateful qualities as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
 dog bad habits, but its essential vice is its hideous lack of 
originality; for until a word or phrase is common property it is not 
slang. Wherein, then, is the sense or humor of repeating it? The dullest
 dunce in the world may have an alert and obedient memory for current 
locutions. For skill in the use of slang no other mental equipment is 
required. However apt and picturesque a particular expression may be, 
the wit of it is his only who invented and first used it: in all others 
its use is forbidden by the commandment “Thou shalt not steal.” A 
self-respecting writer would no more parrot a felicitous saying of 
unknown origin and popular currency than he would plagiarize a lively 
sentiment from Catullus or an epigram from Pope.</p>

<h3 id="THE_RAVAGES_OF_SHAKSPEARITIS">THE RAVAGES OF SHAKSPEARITIS</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">A&nbsp;FAMOUS author says that there is some kind of
 immoral emanation from the horse, and that it affects the character of 
every one who has much to do with the animal. I suppose it is something 
like that which suspires from the earth that is thrown out in digging a 
canal. Perhaps it is possible to construct a short and shallow waterway 
without stirring up enough of this badness to corrupt “all those in 
authority” along the line of it, but if the enterprise is of magnitude, 
like the Suez or the Panama project, results most disastrous to the 
morals of all engaged in the work, excepting those who do it, will 
certainly ensue, as we may soon have the happiness to observe.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon is seen in the case of Shakspeare, whose 
resemblance to a horse and a canal has not, I flatter myself, been 
heretofore pointed out. The subtle suspiration from the work of the 
great dramatist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> however, 
attacks, not the morals, but the intellect. It does not prostrate the 
sense of right and wrong, except in so far as this is dependent on 
mental health; it simply lays waste the judgment by dispersing the 
faculties, as the shadow of a hawk squanders a flock of feeding pigeons.
 Some time we shall perhaps have an English-speaking critic who will be 
immune to Shakspearitis, but as yet Heaven has not seen fit to “raise 
him up.” And when we have him his inaccessibility to the infection will 
do him no good, for we shall indubitably put him to death.</p>
<p>The temptation to these reflections is supplied by looking into Mr. Arlo Bates’s book, <i>Talks on Writing English</i>, where I find this passage quoted from Jeffrey:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Everything in him (Shakspeare) is in unmeasured abundance and 
unequaled perfection—but everything so balanced and kept in 
subordination as not to jostle or disturb or take the place of another. 
The most exquisite poetical conceptions, images and descriptions are 
given with such brevity and introduced with such skill as merely to 
adorn without loading the sense they accompany.... All his excellences, 
like those of Nature herself, are thrown out together; and, instead of 
interfering with, support and recommend each other.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is so fine as to be mostly false. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
 true that Shakspeare throws out his excellences in unmeasured abundance
 and all together; and nothing else in this passage is true. His 
poetical conceptions, images and descriptions are not “given” at all; 
they are “turned loose.” They came from his brain like a swarm of bees. 
They race out, as shouting children from a country school. They 
distract, stun, confuse. So disorderly an imagination has never itself 
been imagined. Shakspeare had no sense of proportion, no care for the 
strength of restraint, no art of saying just enough, no art of any kind.
 He flung about him his enormous and incalculable wealth of jewels with 
the prodigal profusion of a drunken youth mad with the lust of spending.
 Only the magnificence and value of the jewels could blind us to the 
barbarian method of distribution. They dazzle the mind and confound all 
the criteria of the judgment. Small wonder that the incomparable 
Voltaire, French, artistic in every fiber and trained in the severe 
dignities of Grecian art, called this lawless and irresponsible 
spendthrift a drunken savage.</p>
<p>Of no cultivated Frenchman is the judgment on Shakspeare much milder; the man’s “art,” his “precision,” his “perfection”—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
 these are creations of our Teutonic imaginations, heritages of the time
 when in the rush-strewn baronial hall our ancestors surfeited 
themselves on oxen roasted whole and drank to insensibility out of 
wooden flagons holding a gallon each.</p>
<p>In literature, as in all else—in work, in love, in trade, in every 
kind of action or acquisition the Germanic nations are gluttons and 
drunkards. We want everything, as we want our food and drink, in savage 
profusion. And, by the same token, we rule the world.</p>

<h3 id="ENGLANDS_LAUREATE">ENGLAND’S LAUREATE</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">DOUBTLESS there are competent critics of poetry in 
this country, but it is Mr. Alfred Austin’s luck not to have drawn their
 attention. Mr. Austin is not a great poet, but he is a poet. The head 
and front of his offending seems to be that he is a lesser poet than his
 predecessor—his immediate predecessor—for his austerest critic will 
hardly affirm his inferiority to the illustrious Nahum Tate. Nor is Mr. 
Austin the equal by much of Mr. Swinburne, who as Poet Laureate was 
impossible—or at least highly improbable. If he had been offered the 
honor Mr. Swinburne would very likely have knocked off the Prime 
Minister’s hat and jumped upon it. He is of a singularly facetious turn 
of mind, is Mr. Swinburne, and has to be approached with an orange in 
each hand.</p>
<p>Below Swinburne the differences in mental stature among British poets
 are inconsiderable; none is much taller than another, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> Henley only could have written the great lines beginning,</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Out of the dark that covers me,</div>
<div class="i2">Black as the Pit from pole to pole,</div>
<div class="i0">I thank whatever gods may be</div>
<div class="i2">For my unconquerable soul—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="noindent">and he is not likely to do anything like that again; on that proposition</p>
<div class="center small">You your existence might put to the hazard and turn of a wager.</div>
<p>I wonder how many of the merry gentlemen who find a pleasure in 
making mouths at Mr. Austin for what he does and doesn’t do have ever 
read, or reading, have understood, his sonnet on</p>
<div class="center mt5">LOVE’S BLINDNESS.</div>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Now do I know that Love is blind, for I</div>
<div class="i2">Can see no beauty on this beauteous earth,</div>
<div class="i2">No life, no light, no hopefulness, no mirth,</div>
<div class="i0">Pleasure nor purpose, when thou art not nigh.</div>
<div class="i0">Thy absence exiles sunshine from the sky,</div>
<div class="i2">Seres Spring’s maturity, checks Summer’s birth,</div>
<div class="i0">Leaves linnet’s pipe as sad as plover’s cry,</div>
<div class="i2">And makes me in abundance find but dearth.</div>
<div class="i0">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>But when thy feet flutter the dark, and thou</div>
<div class="i2">With orient eyes dawnest on my distress,</div>
<div class="i0">Suddenly sings a bird on every bough,</div>
<div class="i2">The heavens expand, the earth grows less and less,</div>
<div class="i0">The ground is buoyant as the ether now,</div>
<div class="i2">And all looks lovely in thy loveliness.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The influence of Shakspeare is altogether too apparent in this, and 
it has as many faults as merits; but it is admirable work, nevertheless.
 To a poet only come such conceptions as “orient eyes” and feet that 
“flutter the dark.”</p>
<p>Here is another sonnet in which the thought, quite as natural, is 
less obvious. In some of his best work Mr. Austin runs rather to love (a
 great fault, madam) and this is called</p>
<div class="center mt5">LOVE’S WISDOM.</div>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Now on the summit of Love’s topmost peak</div>
<div class="i2">Kiss we and part; no further can we go;</div>
<div class="i2">And better death than we from high to low</div>
<div class="i0">Should dwindle, and decline from strong to weak.</div>
<div class="i0">We have found all, there is no more to seek;</div>
<div class="i2">All we have proved, no more is there to know;</div>
<div class="i0">And Time can only tutor us to eke</div>
<div class="i2">Out rapture’s warmth with custom’s afterglow.</div>
<div class="i0">We cannot keep at such a height as this;</div>
<div class="i2">For even straining souls like ours inhale</div>
<div class="i0">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>But once in life so rarefied a bliss.</div>
<div class="i2">What if we lingered till love’s breath should fail!</div>
<div class="i0">Heaven of my earth! one more celestial kiss,</div>
<div class="i2">Then down by separate pathways to the vale.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Will the merry Pikes of the Lower Mississippi littoral and the 
gamboling whale-backers of the Duluth hinterland be pleased to say what 
is laughable in all this?</p>
<p>It is not to be denied that Mr. Austin has written a good deal of 
“mighty poor stuff,” but I humbly submit that a writer is not to be 
judged by his poorest work, but by his best,—as an athlete is rated, not
 by the least weight that he has lifted, but by the greatest—not by his 
nearest cast of the discus, but by his farthest. Surely a poet, as well 
as a race-horse, is entitled to the benefit of his “record performance.”</p>

<h3 id="HALL_CAINE_ON_HALL_CAINING">HALL CAINE ON HALL CAINING</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">MR. HALL CAINE once took the trouble to explain that he put in three years of hard work on his novel, <i>The Christian</i>,
 rewriting it many times and submitting the several and various parts of
 the work to experts. One kind of expert he failed to consult—a person 
having some knowledge of the English language. Amongst other 
insupportable characteristics the very first sentence in the book 
contains twelve prepositions and several clashing relatives and 
concludes with a sequence of four dactyls! The first sentence is as far 
as I have gone into the book, of which I know only that the manuscript 
was sold for a considerable fortune and that by many thousands of my 
fellow-creatures it is regarded as a distinctly immortaler work than the
 immortalest work of the week immediately preceding the date of its 
publication. Of Mr. Caine himself I know a little more: for example, 
that if he were cast away on an island<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
 never before seen by a white man, in a few months every native would 
have a brand-new novel and Mr. Caine all the cowry-shells in the island.</p>
<p>Following a well-established precedent, he was good enough also to 
impart the secret of his success as a writer of “best-selling” 
books—novels, of course. The secret is genius. That seems simple enough 
and easy enough, but I submit that it was known before. Every author of a
 popular novel has been entirely conscious of his genius and the 
reviewers have known it as well as he. Nevertheless, it is always 
pleasing to find a workman who not only does not quarrel with his tools,
 but exhibits them with pride and affection, for we know then that he is
 a good workman, or—which means much the same thing—gets a good price 
for his product. Mr. Caine gets as good a price as any and is therefore 
as fit as any to expound his methods to the curious.</p>
<p>For it should be said that Mr. Caine does not hold that genius—even 
such genius as his—will produce so great work as his without some 
assistance from industry; one must take the trouble to write or dictate 
the great thoughts that genius inspires. One can not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
 do this without some degree of application to the homely task. Indeed, 
Mr. Caine explains that he writes his novels twice before he permits us 
to read them once. One is glad to know that; it shows that, like the 
country editor, whose burning office attracted a large and intelligent 
class of spectators, he “strives to please.” He took fourteen months to 
write <i>The Eternal City</i>. That was most commendable, for with him 
time is money, but his patient diligence was equaled by that of a man 
that I know, who took fourteen months to read it.</p>
<p>Not only does Mr. Caine work slowly and surely; he advises lesser 
mortals to do so. “Write only when in the humor,” he says. This is good 
advice to any man, of whatever degree of genius, who is ambitious to 
turn out a “best seller,” but better advice would be: Don’t write at 
all. There are less fame in that, less profit and less taking of one’s 
self seriously; but there must be a feeling of greater security 
regarding the next world; for the author of a “best seller” is so 
conspicuous a figure in this world that he may be very sure that God 
sees him.</p>
<p>“Some people,” says Mr. Caine, meaning some persons, doubtless—he writes in Bestsellerese—“say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
 that they can work best when they hurry most, but it is not the case 
with me, and I feel that inspiration does not come to the hurried mind 
so readily as it does when one is able to ponder deeply and shape one’s 
thoughts into some truly perfected form.”</p>
<p>That is an impressive picture. One can almost see Mr. Caine, sitting 
at his table, head in hand, pondering profoundly on his inspiration and 
shaping his thoughts into that truly perfected form demanded by his 
exacting market. This really great man, with chestnuts in his lap, 
arointing the designing witch of spontaneity who would abstract them, is
 a spectacle that will linger long in his own memory. It is one of the 
most pleasing revelations of self that can be found in the literature of
 how to do it. Probably it will have the distinction of surviving all 
Mr. Caine’s other work by as much as six months. If done into bronze by a
 competent sculptor it may outlast even Mr. Caine himself, delighting 
and instructing an entire generation of Indiana novelists, the best in 
the world. Of course it is “on the cards” that he who has given us this 
solemn picture of himself in the veritable act of literary parturition 
may “whack up” something even better.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
 He is not so very old, and in the years remaining to him (may they be 
many and prosperous) he may produce something so incomparably popular 
that even the greatest of his previous work will be, in the luminous 
French of John Phoenix, “<i>frappé parfaitment froid!</i>” Indeed, Mr. 
Caine himself discerns that possibility very clearly. He says: “I do not
 believe I have yet produced my best work”—best selling work—“by any 
means.” It is to be hoped that he has not: yet it is also to be 
regretted that he has had the cruelty to add a new terror to death by 
saying so. To one engaged in dying, the thought of what he may be 
missing by leaving this vale of tears before Mr. Caine has written his <i>Eternalest City</i>
 must generate the wrench and stress of an added pang. It would have 
been kinder to make that forecast to his publisher only. Even <i>in articulo mortis</i>
 (if he have the bad luck to die first) that gentleman’s tantalizing 
vision of an unattainable earthly joy will come with enough of healing 
in its wings partly to salve the smart: coupled with the thought of what
 he will miss will come the consciousness of what he will not have to 
pay for it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I&nbsp;HOLD the belief that the Gift of Dreams is a 
valuable literary endowment—that if by some art not now understood the 
elusive fancies that it supplies could be caught and fixed and made to 
serve we should have a literature “exceeding fair.” In captivity and 
domestication the gift could doubtless be wonderfully improved, as 
animals bred to service acquire new capacities and powers. By taming our
 dreams we shall double our working hours and our most fruitful labor 
will be done in sleep. Even as matters are, Dreamland is a tributary 
province, as witness “Kubla Khan.”</p>
<p>What is a dream? A loose and lawless collocation of memories—a 
disorderly succession of matters once present in the waking 
consciousness. It is a resurrection of the dead, pell-mell—ancient and 
modern, the just and the unjust—springing from their cracked tombs, each
 “in his habit as he lived,” pressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
 forward confusedly to have an audience of the Master of the Revel, and 
snatching one another’s garments as they run. Master? No; he has 
abdicated his authority and they have their will of him; his own is dead
 and does not rise with the rest. His judgment, too, is gone, and with 
it the capacity to be surprised. Pained he may be and pleased, terrified
 and charmed, but wonder he can not feel. The monstrous, the 
preposterous, the unnatural—these all are simple, right and reasonable. 
The ludicrous does not amuse, nor the impossible amaze. The dreamer is 
your only true poet; he is “of imagination all compact.”</p>
<p>Imagination is merely memory. Try to imagine something that you have 
never observed, experienced, heard of or read about. Try to conceive an 
animal, for example, without body, head, limbs or tail—a house without 
walls or roof. But, when awake, having assistance of will and judgment, 
we can somewhat control and direct; we can pick and choose from memory’s
 store, taking that which serves, excluding, though sometimes with 
difficulty, what is not to the purpose; asleep, our fancies “inherit 
us.” They come so grouped, so blended and compounded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
 one with another, so wrought of one another’s elements, that the whole 
seems new; but the old familiar units of conception are there, and none 
beside. Waking or sleeping, we get from imagination nothing new but new 
adjustments: “the stuff that dreams are made on” has been gathered by 
the physical senses and stored in memory, as squirrels hoard nuts. But 
one, at least, of the senses contributes nothing to the fabric of the 
dream: no one ever dreamed an odor. Sight, hearing, feeling, possibly 
taste, are all workers, making provision for our nightly entertainment; 
but Sleep is without a nose. It surprises that those keen observers, the
 ancient poets, did not so describe the drowsy god, and that their 
obedient servants, the ancient sculptors, did not so represent him. 
Perhaps these latter worthies, working for posterity, reasoned that time
 and mischance would inevitably revise their work in this regard, 
conforming it to the facts of nature.</p>
<p>Who can so relate a dream that it shall seem one? No poet has so 
light a touch. As well try to write the music of an Æolian harp. There 
is a familiar species of the genus Bore (<i>Penetrator intolerabilis</i>) who having read a story—perhaps by some master of style—is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
 at the pains elaborately to expound its plot for your edification and 
delight; then thinks, good soul, that now you need not read it. “Under 
substantially similar circumstances and conditions” (as the interstate 
commerce law hath it) I should not be guilty of the like offence; but I 
purpose herein to set forth the plots of certain dreams of my own, the 
“circumstances and conditions” being, as I conceive, dissimilar in this,
 that the dreams themselves are not accessible to the reader. In 
endeavoring to make record of their poorer part I do not indulge the 
hope of a higher success. I have no salt to put upon the tail of a 
dream’s elusive spirit.</p>
<p>I was walking at dusk through a great forest of unfamiliar trees. 
Whence and whither I did not know. I had a sense of the vast extent of 
the wood, a consciousness that I was the only living thing in it. I was 
obsessed by some awful spell in expiation of a forgotten crime 
committed, as I vaguely surmised, against the sunrise. Mechanically and 
without hope, I moved under the arms of the giant trees along a narrow 
trail penetrating the haunted solitudes of the forest. I came at length 
to a brook that flowed darkly and sluggishly across my path, and saw 
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> it was blood. Turning
 to the right, I followed it up a considerable distance, and soon came 
to a small circular opening in the forest, filled with a dim, unreal 
light, by which I saw in the center of the opening a deep tank of white 
marble. It was filled with blood, and the stream that I had followed up 
was its outlet. All round the tank, between it and the enclosing 
forest—a space of perhaps ten feet in breadth, paved with immense slabs 
of marble—were dead bodies of men—a score; though I did not count them I
 knew that the number had some significant and portentous relation to my
 crime. Possibly they marked the time, in centuries, since I had 
committed it. I only recognized the fitness of the number, and knew it 
without counting. The bodies were naked and arranged symmetrically 
around the central tank, radiating from it like spokes of a wheel. The 
feet were outward, the heads hanging over the edge of the tank. Each lay
 upon its back, its throat cut, blood slowly dripping from the wound. I 
looked on all this unmoved. It was a natural and necessary result of my 
offence, and did not affect me; but there was something that filled me 
with apprehension and terror—a monstrous pulsation, beating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
 with a slow, inevitable recurrence. I do not know which of the senses 
it addressed, or if it made its way to the consciousness through some 
avenue unknown to science and experience. The pitiless regularity of 
this vast rhythm was maddening. I was conscious that it pervaded the 
entire forest, and was a manifestation of some gigantic and implacable 
malevolence.</p>
<p>Of this dream I have no further recollection. Probably, overcome by a
 terror which doubtless had its origin in the discomfort of an impeded 
circulation, I cried out and was awakened by the sound of my own voice.</p>
<p>The dream whose skeleton I shall now present occurred in my early 
youth. I could not have been more than sixteen. I am considerably more 
now, yet I recall the incidents as vividly as when the vision was “of an
 hour’s age” and I lay cowering beneath the bed-covering and trembling 
with terror from the memory.</p>
<p>I was alone on a boundless level in the night—in my bad dreams I am 
always alone and it is usually night. No trees were anywhere in sight, 
no habitations of men, no streams nor hills. The earth seemed to be 
covered with a short, coarse vegetation that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
 was black and stubbly, as if the plain had been swept by fire. My way 
was broken here and there as I went forward with I know not what purpose
 by small pools of water occupying shallow depressions, as if the fire 
had been succeeded by rain. These pools were on every side, and kept 
vanishing and appearing again, as heavy dark clouds drove athwart those 
parts of the sky which they reflected, and passing on disclosed again 
the steely glitter of the stars, in whose cold light the waters shone 
with a black luster. My course lay toward the west, where low along the 
horizon burned a crimson light beneath long strips of cloud, giving that
 effect of measureless distance that I have since learned to look for in
 Doré’s pictures, where every touch of his hand has laid a portent and a
 curse. As I moved I saw outlined against this uncanny background a 
silhouette of battlements and towers which, expanding with every mile of
 my journey, grew at last to an unthinkable height and breadth, till the
 building subtended a wide angle of vision, yet seemed no nearer than 
before. Heartless and hopeless I struggled on over the blasted and 
forbidding plain, and still the mighty structure grew until I could no 
longer compass it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> a 
look, and its towers shut out the stars directly overhead; then I passed
 in at an open portal, between columns of cyclopean masonry whose single
 stones were larger than my father’s house.</p>
<p>Within all was vacancy; everything was coated with the dust of 
desertion. A dim light—the lawless light of dreams, sufficient unto 
itself—enabled me to pass from corridor to corridor, and from room to 
room, every door yielding to my hand. In the rooms it was a long walk 
from wall to wall; of no corridor did I ever reach an end. My footfalls 
gave out that strange, hollow sound that is never heard but in abandoned
 dwellings and tenanted tombs. For hours I wandered in this awful 
solitude, conscious of a seeking purpose, yet knowing not what I sought.
 At last, in what I conceived to be an extreme angle of the building, I 
entered a room of the ordinary dimensions, having a single window. 
Through this I saw the same crimson light still lying along the horizon 
in the measureless reaches of the west, like a visible doom, and knew it
 for the lingering fire of eternity. Looking upon the red menace of its 
sullen and sinister glare, there came to me the dreadful truth which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> years later as an extravagant fancy I endeavored to express in verse:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Man is long ages dead in every zone,</div>
<div class="i0">The angels all are gone to graves unknown;</div>
<div class="i2">The devils, too, are cold enough at last,</div>
<div class="i0">And God lies dead before the great white throne!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The light was powerless to dispel the obscurity of the room, and it 
was some time before I discovered in the farthest angle the outlines of a
 bed, and approached it with a prescience of ill. I felt that here 
somehow the bad business of my adventure was to end with some horrible 
climax, yet could not resist the spell that urged me to the fulfilment. 
Upon the bed, partly clothed, lay the dead body of a human being. It lay
 upon its back, the arms straight along the sides. By bending over it, 
which I did with loathing but no fear, I could see that it was 
dreadfully decomposed. The ribs protruded from the leathern flesh; 
through the skin of the sunken belly could be seen the protuberances of 
the spine. The face was black and shriveled and the lips, drawn away 
from the yellow teeth, cursed it with a ghastly grin. A fulness under 
the closed lids seemed to indicate that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
 the eyes had survived the general wreck; and this was true, for as I 
bent above them they slowly opened and gazed into mine with a tranquil, 
steady regard. Imagine my horror how you can—no words of mine can assist
 the conception; the eyes were my own! That vestigial fragment of a 
vanished race—that unspeakable thing which neither time nor eternity had
 wholly effaced—that hateful and abhorrent scrap of mortality, still 
sentient after death of God and the angels, was I!</p>
<p>There are dreams that repeat themselves. Of this class is one of my own,<a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor pginternal" id="FNanchor_1">[1]</a>
 which seems sufficiently singular to justify its narration, though 
truly I fear the reader will think the realms of sleep are anything but a
 happy hunting-ground for my night-wandering soul. This is not true; the
 greater number of my incursions into dreamland, and I suppose those of 
most others, are attended with the happiest results. My imagination 
returns to the body like a bee to the hive, loaded with spoil which, 
reason assisting, is transmuted to honey and stored away in the cells of
 memory to be a joy forever. But the dream which</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>
<p>I am about to relate has a double character; it is strangely dreadful
 in the experience, but the horror it inspires is so ludicrously 
disproportionate to the one incident producing it, that in retrospection
 the fantasy amuses.</p>
<p>I am passing through an open glade in a thinly wooded country. 
Through the belt of scattered trees that bound the irregular space there
 are glimpses of cultivated fields and the homes of strange 
intelligences. It must be near daybreak, for the moon, nearly at full, 
is low in the west, showing blood-red through the mists with which the 
landscape is fantastically freaked. The grass about my feet is heavy 
with dew, and the whole scene is that of a morning in early summer, 
glimmering in the unfamiliar light of a setting full moon. Near my path 
is a horse, visibly and audibly cropping the herbage. It lifts its head 
as I am about to pass, regards me motionless for a moment, then walks 
toward me. It is milk-white, mild of mien and amiable in look. I say to 
myself: “This horse is a gentle soul,” and pause to caress it. It keeps 
its eyes fixed upon my own, approaches and speaks to me in a human 
voice, with human words. This does not surprise, but terrifies, and 
instantly I return to this our world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>
<p>The horse always speaks my own tongue, but I never know what it says.
 I suppose I vanish from the land of dreams before it finishes 
expressing what it has in mind, leaving it, no doubt, as greatly 
terrified by my sudden disappearance as I by its manner of accosting me.
 I would give value to know the purport of its communication.</p>
<p>Perhaps some morning I shall understand—and return no more to this our world.</p>

<h3 id="EDWIN_MARKHAMS_POEMS">EDWIN MARKHAM’S POEMS</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN Edwin Markham’s book, <i>The Man With the Hoe and Other Poems</i>,
 many of the “other poems” are excellent, some are great. If asked to 
name the most poetic—not, if you please, the “loftiest” or most 
“purposeful”—I think I should choose “The Wharf of Dreams.” I venture to
 quote it:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Strange wares are handled on the wharves of sleep;</div>
<div class="i2">Shadows of shadows pass, and many a light</div>
<div class="i2">Flashes a signal fire across the night;</div>
<div class="i0">Barges depart whose voiceless steersmen keep</div>
<div class="i0">Their way without a star upon the deep;</div>
<div class="i2">And from lost ships, homing with ghostly crews,</div>
<div class="i2">Come cries of incommunicable news,</div>
<div class="i0">While cargoes pile the piers a moon-white heap—</div>
<div class="i0">Budgets of dream-dust, merchandise of song,</div>
<div class="i0">Wreckage of hope and packs of ancient wrong,</div>
<div class="i0">Nepenthes gathered from a secret strand,</div>
<div class="i2">Fardels of heartache, burdens of old sins,</div>
<div class="i2">Luggage sent down from dim ancestral inns,</div>
<div class="i0">And bales of fantasy from No-Man’s Land.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Really, one does not every year meet with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
 a finer blending of imagination and fancy than this; and I know not 
where to put a finger on two better lines in recent work than these:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And from lost ships, homing with ghostly crews,</div>
<div class="i0">Come cries of incommunicable news.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The reader to whom these strange lines do not give an actual physical
 thrill may rightly boast himself impregnable to poetic emotion and 
indocible to the meaning of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Markham has said of Poetry—and said greatly:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">She comes like the hush and beauty of the night,</div>
<div class="i2">And sees too deep for laughter;</div>
<div class="i0">Her touch is a vibration and a light</div>
<div class="i2">From worlds before and after.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>But she comes not always so. Sometimes she comes with a burst of 
music, sometimes with a roll of thunder, a clash of weapons, a roar of 
winds or a beating of billow against the rock. Sometimes with a noise of
 revelry, and again with the wailing of a dirge. Like Nature, she 
“speaks a various language.” Mr. Markham, no longer content, as once he 
seemed to be, with interpreting her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
 fluting and warbling and “sweet jargoning,” learned to heed her 
profounder notes, which stir the stones of the temple like the bass of a
 great organ.</p>
<p>In his “Ode to a Grecian Urn” Keats has supplied the greatest—almost 
the only truly great instance of a genuine poetic inspiration derived 
from art instead of nature. In his poems on pictures Mr. Markham shows 
an increasingly desperate determination to achieve success, coupled with
 a lessening ability to merit it. It is all very melancholy, the 
perversion of this man’s high powers to the service of a foolish dream 
by artificial and impossible means. Each effort is more ineffectual than
 the one that went before. Unless he can be persuaded to desist—to cease
 interpreting art and again interpret nature, and turn also from the 
murmurs of “Labor” to the music of the spheres—the “surge and thunder” 
of the universe—the end of his good literary repute is in sight. He 
knows—does he know?—the bitter truth which he might have learned 
otherwise than by experience: that the plaudits of “industrial 
discontent,” even when strengthened by scholars’ commendations of a few 
great lines in the poem that evoked it, are not fame. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> should know, and if he live long will know, that when one begins to be a “labor leader” one ceases to be a poet.</p>
<p>In saying to Mr. Markham, “Thou ailest here and here,” Mrs. Atherton 
has shown herself better at diagnosis than he is himself in telling us 
what is the matter with the rich. “Why,” she asks him, “waste a 
beautiful gift in groveling for popularity with the mob?... Striving to 
please the common mind has a fatal commonizing effect on the writing 
faculty.” It is even so—nothing truer could be said, and Mr. Markham is 
the best proof of its truth. His early work, when he was known to only a
 small circle of admirers, was so good that I predicted for him the 
foremost place among contemporaneous American poets. He sang because he 
“could not choose but sing,” and his singing grew greater and greater. 
Every year he took wider outlooks from “the peaks of song”—had already 
got well above the fools’ paradise of flowers and song-birds and bees 
and women and had invaded the “thrilling region” of the cliff, the eagle
 and the cloud, whence one looks down upon man and out upon the world. 
Then he had the mischance to publish “The Man with the Hoe,” a poem with
 some noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> lines, but an 
ignoble poem. In the first place, it is, in structure, stiff, inelastic,
 monotonous. One line is very like another. The cæsural pauses fall 
almost uniformly in the same places; the full stops always at the 
finals. Comparison of the versification with Milton’s blank will reveal 
the difference of method in all its significance. It is a difference 
analogous to that between painting on ivory and painting on 
canvas—between the dead, flat tints of the one and the lively, changing 
ones due to inequalities of surface in the other. If it seem a little 
exacting to compare Mr. Markham’s blank with that of the only poet who 
has ever mastered that medium in English, I can only say that the noble 
simplicity and elevation of Mr. Markham’s work are such as hardly to 
justify his admeasurement by any standard lower than the highest that we
 have.</p>
<p>My chief objection relates to the sentiment of the piece, the thought
 that the work carries; for although thought is no part of the poetry 
conveying it, and, indeed, is almost altogether absent from some of the 
most precious pieces (lyrical, of course) in our language, no elevated 
composition has the right to be called great if the message that it 
delivers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> is neither true 
nor just. All poets, even the little ones, are feelers, for poetry is 
emotional; but all the great poets are thinkers as well. Their 
sympathies are as broad as the race, but they do not echo the peasant’s 
philosophies of the workshop and the field. In Mr. Markham’s poem the 
thought is that of the labor union—even to the workworn threat of rising
 against the wicked well-to-do and taking it out of their hides.</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Who made him dead to rapture and despair,</div>
<div class="i0">A thing that grieves not and that never hopes,</div>
<div class="i0">Stolid and stunned, a brother to the ox?</div>
<div class="i0">Who loosened and let down this brutal jaw?</div>
<div class="i0">Whose was the hand that slanted back this brow?</div>
<div class="i0">Whose breath blew out the light within this brain?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>One is somehow reminded by these lines of Coleridge’s questions in 
the Chamouni hymn, and one is tempted to answer them the same way: God. 
“The Man with the Hoe” is not a product of the “masters, lords and 
rulers in all lands”: they are not, and no class of men is, accountable 
for him, his limitations and his woes, which are not of those “that 
kings or laws can cause or cure.” The “masters, lords and rulers” are as
 helpless “in the fell clutch of circumstance” as he—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
 Mr. Markham would be speedily made to understand if appointed Dictator.
 The notion that the sorrows of the humble are due to the selfishness of
 the great is “natural,” and can be made poetical, but it is silly. As a
 literary conception it has not the vitality of a sick fish. It will not
 carry a poem of whatever excellence through two generations. That a man
 of Mr. Markham’s splendid endowments should be chained to the body of 
this literary death is no less than a public calamity.</p>
<p>For his better work in poetry Mr. Markham merits all the praise that 
he has received for “The Man with the Hoe,” and more. It is not likely 
that he is now under any illusion in the matter. He probably knows the 
real nature of his sudden flare of “popularity”; knows that to-morrow it
 will be “one with Nineveh and Tyre”; knows that its only service to him
 is to arrest attention of competent critics and scholars who would 
otherwise have overlooked him for a time. The “plaudits of the 
multitude” can not long be held by the poet, and are not worth holding. 
The multitude knows nothing of poetry and does not read it. The 
multitude will applaud you to-day, calumniate you to-morrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
 and thwack you athwart the mazzard the day after. He who builds upon 
the sea-sand of its favor holds possession by a precarious tenure; the 
wind veers and the wave</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Lolls out his large tongue—</div>
<div class="i2">Licks the whole labor flat.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If the great have left the humble so wise that the philosophies of 
the factory and the plow-tail are true; if the sentiments and the taste 
of the mob are so just and elevated that its judgment of poetry is 
infallible and its approval a precious possession; if “the masses” have 
more than “a thin veneering of civilization,” and are not in peace as 
fickle as the weather and in anger as cruel as the sea; if these victims
 of an absolutely universal oppression “in <i>all</i> lands” are deep, 
discriminating, artistic, liberal, magnanimous—in brief, wise and 
good—it is difficult to see what they have to complain about. Mr. 
Markham, at least, is forbidden to weep for them, for he is a lover of 
Marcus Aurelius, of Seneca, of Epictetus. These taught, and taught 
truly—one from the throne of an empire, one writing at a gold table, and
 one in the intervals of service as a slave—the supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
 value of wisdom and goodness, the vanity of power and wealth, the 
triviality of privation, discomfort and pain. Mr. Markham is a disciple 
of Jesus Christ, who from the waysides and the fields taught that 
poverty is not only a duty, but indispensable to salvation. So my <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> runs thus: The objects of our poet’s fierce invective and awful threats have suffered his <i>protégés</i>
 to remain rather better off than they are themselves—have appropriated 
and monopolized only what is not worth having. In view of this 
mitigating circumstance I feel justified in demanding in their behalf a 
lighter sentence. Let the portentous effigy of the French Revolution be 
forbidden to make faces at them.</p>
<p>I know of few literary phenomena more grotesque than some of those 
growing out of “The Man with the Hoe”—that sudden popularity being 
itself a thing which “goes neare to be fonny.” Mr. Markham, whom for 
many years those of us who modestly think ourselves <i>illuminati</i> 
considered a great poet whose greatness full surely was a-ripening, 
wrote many things far and away superior to “The Man,” but these brought 
him recognition from the judicious only, with which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
 would all have sworn that he was content. All at once he published a 
poem which, despite some of its splendid lines, is neither true in 
sentiment nor admirable in form—which is, in fact, addressed to peasant 
understandings and soured hearts. Instantly follow a blaze and thunder 
of notoriety, seen and heard over the entire continent; and even the 
coasts of Europe are “telling of the sound.” Straightway before the 
astonished vision of his friends the author stands transfigured! The 
charming poet has become a demagogue, a “labor leader” spreading that 
gospel of hate known as “industrial brotherhood,” a “walking delegate” 
diligently inciting a strike against God and clamoring for repeal of the
 laws of nature. Saddest of all, we find him conscientiously promoting 
his own vogue. He personally appears at meetings of cranks and 
incapables convened to shriek against the creed of law and order; speaks
 at meetings of sycophants eager to shine by his light; introduces 
lecturers to meetings of ninnies and femininnies convened to glorify 
themselves. When he is not waving the red flag of discontent and beating
 the big drum of revolution I presume he is resting—perched, 
St.-Simeon-Styliteswise, atop a lofty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
 capital I, erected in the market place, diligently and rapturously 
contemplating his new identity. All of which is very sad to those of us 
who find it difficult to unlove him.</p>
<p>The trouble with Mr. Markham is that he has formed the habit of 
thinking of mankind as divided on the property line—as comprising only 
two classes, the rich and the poor. When a man has acquired that habit 
he is lost to sense and righteousness. Assassins sometimes reform, and 
with increasing education thieves renounce the error of theft to embrace
 the evangel of embezzlement; but a demagogue never gets again into 
shape unless he becomes wealthy. I hope Mr. Markham’s fame will so 
promote his pecuniary interest that it will convert him from the 
conviction that his birth was significantly coincident in point of time 
with the Second Advent. Only one thing is more disagreeable than a man 
with a mission, namely a woman with a mission, and the superior 
objectionableness of the latter is largely due to her trick of inspiring
 the former.</p>
<p>Mr. Markham seems now to look upon himself as the savior of society; 
to believe with entire sincerity that in his light and leading mankind 
can be guided out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> 
wilderness of Self into the promised land of Altruria; that he can alter
 the immemorial conditions of human existence; that a new Heaven and a 
new Earth can be created by the power of his song. Most melancholy of 
all, the song has lost its power and its charm. Since he became the 
Laureate of Demagogy he has written little that is poetry: in the smug 
prosperity that he reviles in others, his great gift “shrinks to its 
second cause and is no more.” That in the great white light of 
inevitable disillusion he will recover and repossess it, giving us again
 the flowers and fruits of a noble imagination in which the dream of an 
impossible and discreditable hegemony has no part, I should be sorry to 
disbelieve.</p>

<h3 id="THE_KREUTZER_SONATA">“THE KREUTZER SONATA”</h3>
</div>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="drop-cap">NOTHING in this book directly discloses the author’s
 views of the marriage relation. The horrible story of Posdnyschew’s 
matrimonial experience—an experience which, barring its tragic finale, 
he affirms not to be an individual but a general one—is related by 
himself. There is no more in it to show directly what Tolstoi thinks of 
the matters in hand than there is in a play to show what the playwright 
thought. We are always citing the authority of Shakspeare by quotations 
from his plays—in which every sentiment is obviously conceived with a 
view to its fitness to the character of the imaginary person who utters 
it, and supplies no clew to the author’s convictions.</p>
<p>In <i>The Kreutzer Sonata</i>, however, the case is somewhat 
different. Whereas Shakspeare had in view an artistic (and commercial) 
result, Tolstoi’s intention is clearly moral: his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
 aim is not entertainment, but instruction. To that end he foregoes the 
advantage of those literary effects which he so well knows how to 
produce, confining his exceptional powers to bald narrative, overlaid 
with disquisitions deriving their only vitality from the moral purpose 
everywhere visible.</p>
<p>A man marries a woman. They quarrel of course; their life is of 
course wretched beyond the power of words to express. Jealousy naturally
 ensuing, the man murders the woman. That is the “plot,” and it is 
without embellishment. Its amplification is accomplished by “preaching”;
 its episodes are sermons on subjects not closely related to the main 
current of thought. Clearly, the aim of a book so constructed, even by a
 skilful literary artist, is not an artistic aim. Tolstoi desires it to 
be thought that he entertains the convictions uttered by the lips of 
Posdnyschew. He has, indeed, distinctly avowed them elsewhere than in 
this book. Like other convictions, they must stand or fall according to 
the stability of their foundation upon the rock of truth; but the fact 
that they are held by a man of so gigantic powers as Tolstoi gives them 
an interest and importance which the world, strange to say, has been 
quick to recognize.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>
<p>Some of these convictions are peculiarly Tolstoi’s own; others he 
holds in common with all men and women gifted with that rarest of 
intellectual equipments, the faculty of observation, and blessed with 
opportunity for its use. Anybody can see, but observation is another 
thing. It is something more than discernment, yet may be something less 
than accurate understanding of the thing discerned. Such as it is, 
Tolstoi has it in the highest degree. Nothing escapes him: his 
penetration is astonishing: he searches the very soul of things, making 
record of his discoveries with a pitiless frankness which to feebler 
understandings is brutal and terrifying. To him nothing is a mere 
phenomenon; everything is a phenomenon <i>plus</i> a meaning connected 
with a group of meanings. The meanings he may, and in my poor judgment 
commonly does, misread, but the phenomenon, the naked fact, he will see.
 Nothing can hide it from him nor make it appear to him better than it 
is. It is this terrible power of discernment, with this unsparing 
illumination compelling the reluctant attention of others, which 
environs him with animosities and implacable resentments. His is the 
Mont Blanc of minds; about the base of his conspicuous, cold 
intelligence the Arve and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> 
Arvieron of ignorance and optimism rave ceaselessly. It is of the nature
 of a dunce to confound exposure with complicity. Point out to him the 
hatefulness of that which he has been accustomed to admire, and nothing 
shall thenceforward convince him that you have not had a guilty hand in 
making it hateful. Tolstoi, in intellect a giant and in heart a child, a
 man of blameless life, and spotless character, devout, righteous, 
spectacularly humble and aggressively humane, has had the distinction to
 be the most widely and sincerely detested man of two continents. He has
 had the courage to utter a truth of so supreme importance that one-half
 the civilized world has for centuries been engaged in a successful 
conspiracy to conceal it from the other half—the truth that the modern 
experiment of monogamic marriage by the dominant tribes of Europe and 
America is a dismal failure. He is not the first by many who has 
testified to that effect, but he is the first in our time whose 
testimony has arrested so wide and general attention—a result that is to
 be attributed partly to his tremendous reputation and partly to his 
method of giving witness. He does not in this book deal in argument, is 
no controversialist. He says the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> thing that is in him to say and we can take it or leave it.</p>
<p><i>The Kreutzer Sonata</i> is not an obscene nor even an indelicate 
book: the mind that finds it so is an indelicate, an obscene mind. It is
 not, according to our popular notions, “a book for young girls.” 
Nevertheless, it is most desirable that young girls should 
know—preferably through their parents who can speak with authority of 
experience—the truth which it enforces: namely, that marriage, like 
wealth, offers no hope of lasting happiness. Despite the implication 
that “they lived happily ever after,” it is not for nothing that the 
conventional love story ends with the chime of wedding bells. As the 
Genius vanished when Mirza asked him what lay under the cloud beyond the
 rock of adamant, so the story teller prudently forestalls further 
investigation by taking himself off. He has an innate consciousness that
 the course of true love whose troubled current he has been tracing 
begins at marriage to assume something of the character of a raging 
torrent.</p>
<p>Tolstoi strikes hard: not one man nor woman a year married but must 
wince beneath his blows. They are all members of a dishonest conspiracy.
 They conceal their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> wounds
 and swear that all is right and well with them. They give their Hell a 
good character, but in their secret souls they chafe and groan under the
 weight and heat of their chains. They come out from among their 
corruption and dead men’s bones only to give the sepulchre another 
coating of whitewash and call attention to its manifold advantages as a 
dwelling. They are like the members of some “ancient and honorable 
order,” who gravely repeat to others falsehoods by which they were 
themselves cheated into membership. The minatory oath alone is lacking, 
its binding restraint supplied by the cowardice that dares not brave the
 resentment of co-conspirators and the fury of their dupes.</p>
<p>No human institution is perfect, nor nearly perfect. None comes 
within a world’s width of accomplishing the purpose for which it was 
devised, and all in time become so perverted as to serve a contrary one.
 But of all institutions, marriage as we have it here, and as they 
evidently have it in Russia, most lamentably falls short of its design. 
Nay, it is the one of them which is become most monstrously wrenched 
awry to the service of evil. To have observed this—to have had the 
intrepidity to affirm it in a world infested with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
 fools and malevolents who can not understand how anything can be known 
except by the feeble and misleading light of personal experience—that is
 much. It marks Tolstoi in a signal way as one eminent above the 
cloud-region, with a mental and spiritual outlook unaffected by the 
ground-reek of darkened counsel and invulnerable to the slings and 
arrows of defamation. Nevertheless, while admiring his superb courage 
and attesting the clarity of his vision, I think he imperfectly discerns
 the underlying causes of the phenomena that he reports.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer explains the shamefacedness of lovers, their tendency to
 withdraw into nooks and corners to do their wooing, by the circumstance
 that they plan a crime—they conspire to bring a human soul into a world
 of woe. Tolstoi takes something of the same ground as to the nature of 
their offence. Marriage he thinks a sin, and being a religionist regards
 the resulting and inevitable wretchedness as its appointed punishment.</p>
<p>“Little did I think of her physical and intellectual life,” says 
Posdnyschew, in explanation of conjugal antagonism. “I could not 
understand whence sprang our mutual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
 hostility, but how clearly I see now! This hostility was nothing but 
the protest of human nature against the beast that threatened to devour 
it. I could not understand this hatred. And how could it have been 
different? This hostility was nothing else than the mutual hatred of two
 accessories in a crime—that of instigation, that of accomplishment.”</p>
<p>Marriage being a sin, it follows that celibacy is a virtue and a 
duty. Tolstoi has the courage of his convictions in this as in other 
things. He is too sharp not to see where this leads him and too honest 
to stop short of its logical conclusion. Here he is truly magnificent! 
He perceives that his ideal, if attained, would be annihilation of the 
race. That, as he has elsewhere in effect pointed out, is no affair of 
his. He is not concerned for the perpetuity of the race, but for its 
happiness through freedom from the lusts of the flesh. What is it to him
 if the god whom, oddly enough, he worships has done his work so badly 
that his creatures can not be at the same time chaste, happy and alive? 
Every one to his business—God as creator and, if he please, preserver; 
Tolstoi as reformer.</p>
<p>For his views on the duty of celibacy, it is only fair to say, Tolstoi goes directly to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> teaching of Jesus Christ, with what accuracy of interpretation, not being skilled in theology I am unwilling to say.</p>
<p>From his scorn of physicians it may be inferred that our author is 
imperfectly learned in their useful art, and therefore unfamiliar with 
whatever physiological side the question of celibacy may have. It is 
perhaps sufficient to say that in the present state of our knowledge the
 advantages of a life ordered after the Tolstoian philosophy seem rather
 spiritual than physical. Doubtless “they didn’t know everything down in
 Judee,” but St. Paul appears to have had a glimmering sense of this 
fact, if it is a fact.</p>
<p>To attribute the miseries which are inseparable from marriage as the 
modern Caucasian has the heroism to maintain it to any single and simple
 cause is most unphilosophical; our civilization is altogether too 
complex to admit of any such cheap and easy method. Doubtless there are 
many factors in the problem; a few, however, seem sufficiently obvious 
to any mind which, having an historical outlook wider than its immediate
 environment in time and space, with</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The monogamous marriage ignores, for example, the 
truth that Man is a polygamous animal. Of all the men and women who have
 been born into this world, only one in many has ever even so much as 
heard of any other system than polygamy. To suppose that within a few 
brief centuries monogamy has been by law and by talking so firmly 
established as effectually to have stayed the momentum of the original 
instinct is to hold that the day of miracles is not only not past, but 
has really only recently arrived. It implies, too, and entails, a blank 
blindness to the most patent facts of easy observation. With admirable 
gravity the modern Caucasian has legislated himself into theoretical 
monogamy, but he has, as yet, not effected a repeal of the laws of 
nature, and has in truth shown very little disposition to disregard them
 and observe his own. The men of our time and race are in heart and life
 about as polygamous as their good ancestors were before them, and 
everybody knows it who knows anything worth knowing. But not she to whom
 the knowledge would have the greatest practical value; the person whom 
all the powers of modern society seem in league to cheat; the young 
girl.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>
<p>Another cause of the wretchedness of the married state—but of this 
Tolstoi seems inadequately conscious—is that marriage confers rights 
deemed incalculably precious which there is no means whatever of 
confirming and enforcing. The consciousness that these rights are held 
by the precarious tenure of a “vow” which never had, to one of the 
parties, much more than a ceremonial significance, and a good faith 
liable, in the other, to suspension by resentment and the vicissitudes 
of vanity and caprice; the knowledge that these rights are exposed to 
secret invasion invincible to the most searching inquiry; the savage 
superstition that their invasion “dishonors” the one to whom it is most 
hateful, and who of all persons in the world is least an accomplice—all 
this begets an apprehension which grows to distrust, and from distrust 
to madness. The apprehension is natural because reasonable: its 
successive stages of development are what you will, but the culmination 
is disaster and the wreck of peace.</p>
<p>Of the sombre phenomena of the marriage relation observable by men 
like Tolstoi, with eyes in their heads, brains behind the eyes and not 
too much scruple in selecting points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
 of view outside the obscurity and confusion of a personal experience, a
 hundred additional explanations might be adduced, all more valid, in my
 judgment, than that to which he pins his too ready faith; but those 
noted seem sufficient. With regard to any matter touching less nearly 
the unreasoning sensibilities of the human heart, they would, I think, 
be deemed more than sufficient.</p>
<p>What, then—rejecting Tolstoi’s prescription—is the remedy? In view of
 the failure of our experiment should we revert to first principles, 
adopting polygamy with such modifications as would better adapt it to 
the altered situation? Ought we to try free love, requiring the state to
 keep off its clumsy hands and let men and women as individuals manage 
this affair, as they do their religions, their friendships and their 
diet?</p>
<p>For my part I know of no remedy, nor do I believe that one can be 
formulated. It is of the nature of the more gigantic evils to be 
irremediable—a truth against which poor humanity instinctively revolts, 
entailing the additional afflictions of augmented nonsense and wasted 
endeavor. Nevertheless something may be done in mitigation. The marriage
 relation that we have we shall probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
 continue to have, and its Dead Sea fruits will grow no riper and 
sweeter with time. But the lie that describes them as luscious and 
satisfying is needless. Let the young be taught, not celibacy, but 
fortitude. Point out to them the exact nature of the fool’s paradise 
into which they will pretty certainly enter and perhaps ought to enter. 
Teach them that the purpose of marriage is whatever the teacher may 
conceive it to be, but <i>not</i> happiness. Mercifully reduce the terrible disproportion between expectation and result. In so far as <i>The Kreutzer Sonata</i> accomplishes this end, in so far as it teaches this lesson, it is a good book.</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>Tolstoi is a literary giant. He has a “giant’s strength,” and has 
unfortunately learned to “use it like a giant”—which, I take it, means 
not necessarily with conscious cruelty, but with stupidity. Excepting 
when he confines himself to pure romance, and to creation of works 
which, after the manner of Dr. Holmes, may be described as medicated 
fable—the man seems to write with the very faintest possible 
consciousness of anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> 
good or even passably decent, in human nature. His characters are moved 
by motives which are redeemed from monstrous baseness only by being 
pettily base. In <i>War and Peace</i>, for example,—a book so crowded 
with characters, historical and imaginary, that the author himself can 
not carry them in his memory without dropping them all along his 
trail—there is but one person who is not either a small rascal or a 
great fool or both. Such a discreditable multitude of unpleasant persons
 no one but their maker—in whose image they are not made—ever collected 
between the covers of a single book. From Napoleon down to the ultimate 
mujik they go through life with heads full of confusion, hearts 
distended with selfishness and mouths running over with lies. If Tolstoi
 wrote as a satirist, with obvious cynicism, all this would be easily 
enough understood; but nothing, evidently, is further from his 
intention; he is essentially a preacher and honestly believes that his 
powerful caricatures are portraits from life; or rather—for that we may 
admit—that the total impression derived from a comprehensive view of 
them is a true picture of human character, charged in its every shadow 
(there are no lights) with instruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
 and edification. I can not say how it goes with others, but all that is
 left to me by this hideous “march past” of detestables; this sombre 
tableau of the intellectually dead; this fortuitous concourse of a 
random rascalry unlawfully begotten of an exuberant fancy and a pitiless
 observation—“all of it all” that remains with me is a taste in the 
mouth which I can only describe as pallid.</p>
<p>In his personal character Tolstoi seems to be the only living 
Christian, in the sense in which Christ was a Christian—whatever credit 
may inhere in that—of whom we have any account; but in judging his books
 we have nothing to do with that. He has a superb imagination and must 
be master of a matchless style, for we get glimpses of it, even through 
the translations of men who are probably familiar enough with Russian 
and certainly altogether too familiar with English. The trouble with him
 is, as Mr. Matthew Arnold said of Byron, he doesn’t know enough. He 
sees everything, but he has not freed his mind from the captivating 
absurdity, so dominant in the last generation, that human events occur 
without human agency, individual will counting for no more in the 
ordering of affairs than does a floating chip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
 in determining the course of the river. The commander of an army is 
commanded by his men. Napoleon was pushed by his soldiers hither and 
thither all over Europe; they by some blind, occult impulse which 
Tolstoi can not understand. He goes so far as to affirm that an army 
takes one route instead of another by silent consent and understanding 
among its widely separated fractions; infantinely unaware that not one 
of them could move a mile without a dozen sets of detailed instructions 
to commanders, quartermasters, chiefs of ordnance, commissaries of 
subsistence, engineers and so forth. Tolstoi has entered the camp of 
History with a flag of truce and been blindfolded at the outpost.</p>
<p>When Tolstoi trusts to his imagination and doesn’t need to know anything, he is inaccessible to censure. <i>The Cossacks</i>,
 one of his earlier works, is a prodigiously clever novel. About a half 
of the book, as I remember it, concerns itself with the killing of a 
single Circassian by a single Cossack. The shadow of that event is over 
it all, ominous, portentous; and I know of nothing finer nor more 
dramatic in its way than the narrative of the death of the dead man’s 
avengers, knee to knee among the rain-pools of the steppe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
 chanting through their beards their last fierce defiance. What to this 
was the slaughter at Austerlitz, the conflagration at Moscow, flinging 
its black shadows over half a world, if we have not Hugo’s eyes to see 
them through? Only the gods look large upon Olympus.</p>
<p>But do me the favor to compare Tolstoi at his worst with other 
popular writers at their best. It is eagle and hens. It is sun and 
tallow candles. From the heights where he sits conspicuous, they are 
visible as black beetles. Nay, they are slugs; their brilliant work is a
 shine of slime which dulls behind them even as they creep. When one of 
these godlets dies the first man to pass his grave will say: “Why has he
 no monument?”—the second: “What! a monument?”—the third: “Who the devil
 was he?”</p>

<h3 id="EMMA_FRANCES_DAWSON">EMMA FRANCES DAWSON</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN nearly all of Miss Dawson’s work that I have seen
 is an elusive something defying analysis, even description—something 
that is not in the words. I do not know how she gets it where it is; I 
never could either surprise her secret by swift strokes of attention, 
come upon it by patient still-hunting, nor in any way get at the trick 
of it. I can name it only in metaphor as a light behind the words; a 
light like that of Poe’s “red litten eves”; a light such as falls at 
sunset upon desolate marshes, tingeing the plumage of the tall heron and
 prophesying the joyless laugh of the loon. That selfsame light shines 
somewhere through and under Doré’s long parallel cloud-bands along his 
horizons, and I have seen it, with an added bleakness, backgrounding the
 tall rood in the Lone Mountain cemetery of San Francisco. I dare say it
 is all very easy—to Miss Dawson: she simply writes and some “remote, 
unfriended, melancholy” ancestor stands by to “do the rest.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>
<p>The publication of Miss Dawson’s <i>An Itinerant House and Other Stories</i>
 is an event, doubtless, which does not seem at present—at least not to 
that cave-bat, “the general reader”—to cut much of a figure, but I shall
 miss my guess if it do not hold attention when Father Time has much 
that the world admires snugly tucked away in his wallet—“alms for 
oblivion.” This is a guess only: I am not a believer in the doctrine 
that good literary work has some inherent quality compelling recognition
 and conferring vitality. Good literary work, like anything else, 
endures if the conditions favor, perishes if they do not; so my guess, 
upon examination, dwindles to a hope compounded of rather more desire 
than expectation.</p>
<p>Miss Dawson’s book is not to be judged as other books. It will help 
the reader to a just appreciation of this wonderful woman’s work in 
letters if he understand beforehand that the world she sees is not the 
world we see; that her men and women are as unearthly as their 
environment, making no demands whatever on our sympathies, our 
affections, our admiration. Indeed, she cares nothing for them herself, 
putting an end to their strange, unhuman existence when done with them 
as indifferently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> as a 
tired player removes the chessmen from board to box. This, for example, 
is how she disposes of a few that have become superfluous:</p>
<p>“Mrs. Anson proved a hard-faced, cold-hearted Cape Cod woman, a scold
 and drudge, who hated us as much as we disliked her. Homesick and 
unhappy, she soon went East and died. Within a year Anson was found dead
 where he had gone hunting in the Saucelito woods, supposed a suicide; 
Dering was hung by the Vigilantes and the rest were scattered on the 
four winds.”</p>
<p>But when Miss Dawson’s narrative flows with a loitering current you 
may commonly hear the sound of slow music and get glimpses of a darkened
 stage.</p>
<p>These stories have all a good deal of the supernatural and very 
little of the natural. The lover of “realism” (who is sometimes pleased 
to call himself a “veritist”) may with great profit diligently let them 
alone; as may also the mere idler, who reads with a delinquent 
advertence, to pass the time. Miss Dawson is too true an artist to write
 for a slack attention: every page of her book is rich with 
significances underlying the narrative like gold in the bed of a stream.
 And this is especially true of the poems.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>
<p>Those poems, by the way—how came they there? Why is there a poet in 
every story, whose verses have nothing to do with the action of the 
piece, though always in harmony with its spirit? I think I know the 
secret of this irrelevant feature of the work, and a pathetic one it is:
 Miss Dawson puts her poetry into her prose because she can not get it 
published otherwise—the more shame to our schools and public. Not all 
her verse is as good as the prose that carries it. Some of it is 
ungrammatical, and two whole pages of one piece have only the finals 
“ain” and “aining”—an insupportable performance. Much of it lacks ease, 
fluency; but all is worth reading and reading again; and in the “Ballade
 of the Sea of Sleep” are an elevation and largeness that no living poet
 has excelled.</p>
<p>The scene of all Miss Dawson’s stories is San Francisco—her San 
Francisco—San Francisco as she sees it from her eyrie atop of “Russian 
Hill.” To her it is a dream city—a city of wraiths and things forbidden 
to the senses—of half-heard whispers from tombs of men long dead and 
damned—of winds that sing dirges, clouds that are signs and portents, 
fogs peopled with fantastic existences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
 pranking like mad, as is the habit of all sea-folk on shore leave—a 
city where it is never morning, where the birds never sing, where 
children are unknown, and where at night the street-lights at the 
summits of the hills “flare as if out of the sky,” signaling mysterious 
messages from another world. In short, this sister to Hugo has breathed 
into the gross material San Francisco so strange a soul that to him who 
has read her book the name of the town must henceforth have a meaning 
that never before attached to any word of human speech. Wherefore I say 
of this book that it is a work of supreme genius; and I try to have 
faith to believe that whatever else may befall it, while the language in
 which it is written remains intelligible to men it will not fail to 
challenge the attention and engage the interest of the judicious.</p>
<p>To those who have feared the effect upon Miss Dawson’s powers of 
time, sorrow, privation and hope deferred, it is a joy to note that her 
latest and longest story, “A Gracious Visitation”—the one written 
especially for this volume, the others being from twenty to thirty years
 old—is the best. It is indeed a marvelous creation, and I know of 
nothing in literature having a sufficient resemblance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
 to it to serve as a basis of comparison. In point of mere originality, I
 should say it is unsurpassed and unsurpassable; the ability to figure 
to oneself a story more novel and striking would, in a writer, imply the
 ability to write one—which I think the most capable writer would be 
slowest to claim. The best of the other stories is by no means the one 
that gives its title to the book. I shall not undertake to say which is 
best, but shall conclude by quoting the “envoy” of “The Ballade of the 
Sea of Sleep”;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">UPON the cover of the English translation of this 
young artist’s journal is displayed Gladstone’s judgment that it is “a 
book without a parallel.” That is not very high praise, certainly; it 
may be said of many books which the judicious would “willingly let die”;
 and in this case the judicious will hope that a parallel work may be 
long denied to the taste that craves it. The book from cover to cover is
 distinctly unwholesome. It has the merit of candor; its frankness is 
appalling. Yet one can not help suspecting the quality of that 
frankness. Did this young girl, who began at twelve, and for a dozen 
years—almost to the day of her death—poured into her journal her 
heterogenous and undigested thoughts, fancies and feelings with a view 
to publication and a hope of fame as a result of it—did she after all 
make as honest a record as she doubtless supposed herself to be doing? 
It will hardly seem so to one who has written much for publication.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>
<p>Such a one may justly enough distrust, although he can not altogether
 reject, the evidences of the text, which are necessarily studied and 
interpreted in the light of the text itself; but knowing something of 
the conditions of literary composition he will be slow to believe that 
the young diarist could at the same time remember and forget that she 
was writing to be read. Nor will it seem to him that his doubt if she 
put down all that came into her head is too hardy an assumption of 
knowledge of how Russian young women think and feel. Something doubtless
 must be allowed for individual character and disposition in this case 
as in another, but then, too, one must be permitted to remember that 
even a Russian young woman of more or less consuming self-consciousness 
and sex-consciousness is merely human, belonging to the race which daily
 thanks its Maker for not putting windows in breasts. Even a Russian 
maiden with a private method of estimating her intellectual importance 
who should write <i>all</i> her thoughts would probably be invited to 
stay her steps toward the Temple of Fame long enough to make 
acquaintance of the police.</p>
<p>But if the diarist has not written down all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
 her thoughts and feelings, how can the reader be quite sure that she 
has accurately reported those of them that she professes to give?—how 
that they are not afterthoughts, some of them, at least, evolved in the 
process of revision for the press? I do not know if upon this point 
there is any other than internal evidence and the probabilities; my 
reading in the somewhat raw and raucous literature of the subject has 
not been quite exhaustive. The internal evidence and the probabilities 
point pretty plainly to revision of the text, for which the reader might
 have been more grateful if it had been more thoroughly made. Much of 
the book, in truth, might advantageously have been revised out of 
existence—much of what is left, I mean.</p>
<p>Marie Bashkirtseff was born in 1860 and died of consumption in 1884. 
She was given a good education and knew some of the advantages of 
travel. Having a love of art—which she mistook for ability to produce 
works of art—she became a painter and by dint of study under the spur of
 vanity performed some fairly creditable work which, while the fashion 
of reading her journal was “on,” commanded fair prices and brought 
gladness and sunshine into the homes of good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
 Americans of long purses and short schooling. She was perhaps rather 
more than less successful in painting than in expounding the excellences
 of the paintings of others. In such criticism as she gives us in her 
journal one does not detect any understanding. “This is not art; it is 
Nature herself”; “the face is real; it is flesh and blood”—such 
judgments as these are sprinkled all through the book, recalling the 
dear old familiar jargon of the “dramatic critics” of the newspapers; 
“Jonesmith was no longer himself but Hamlet”; “Brown-Robinson completely
 identified himself with his rôle, and it was Julius Cæsar himself that 
we saw before our eyes.” The crudest and most meaningless form of art 
criticism is to declare the representation the thing represented, and 
poor Marie Bashkirtseff seldom goes further in accounting for her 
adoration of the works of such masters as Bastien-Lepage, Corot and 
Duran.</p>
<p>There must have been something engaging in the girl, for she seems to
 have acquired the friendship of such men, and to have retained it. Her 
account of those last days when she and Bastien-Lepage—each with a leg 
in the grave, like a caught fox dragging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
 its trap—caused themselves to be brought together to compare the 
ravages of their disorders in silence is pathetic with the pathos of the
 morgue. One would rather have been spared it. It leaves a bad taste in 
the memory and fitly concludes a book which is morbid, hysterical and 
unpleasant beyond anything of its kind in literature—“a book without a 
parallel.” It enforces and illustrates a useful truth: that when 
suffering from internal disorders one can not afford to turn oneself 
inside out as an exercise in literary calisthenics.</p>

<h3 id="A_POET_AND_HIS_POEM">A POET AND HIS POEM</h3>
</div>
<div class="center">(<i>From “The Cosmopolitan” Magazine, September, 1907</i>)</div>
<p class="drop-cap">WHATEVER length of days may be accorded to this 
magazine, it is not likely to do anything more notable in literature 
that it accomplishes in this issue by publication of Mr. George 
Sterling’s poem, “A Wine of Wizardry.” Doubtless the full significance 
of this event will not be immediately apprehended by more than a select 
few, for understanding of poetry has at no time been a very general 
endowment of our countrymen. After a not inconsiderable acquaintance 
with American men of letters and men of affairs I find myself unable to 
name a dozen of whom I should be willing to affirm their possession of 
this precious gift—for a gift it indubitably is; and of these not all 
would, in my judgment, be able to discern the light of genius in a poem 
not authenticated by a name already famous, or credentialed by a general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
 assent. It is not commonly permitted to even the luckiest of poets to 
“set the Thames on fire” with his first match; and I venture to add that
 the Hudson is less combustible than the Thames. Anybody can see, or can
 think that he sees, what has been pointed out, but original discovery 
is another matter. Carlyle, indeed, has noted that the first impression 
of a work of genius is disagreeable—which is unfortunate for its author 
if he is unknown, for upon editors and publishers a first impression is 
usually all that he is permitted to make.</p>
<p>From the discouraging operation of these uncongenial conditions Mr. 
Sterling is not exempt, as the biography of this poem would show; yet 
Mr. Sterling is not altogether unknown. His book, <i>The Testimony of the Suns, and Other Poems</i>,
 published in 1903, brought him recognition in the literary Nazareth 
beyond the Rocky Mountains, whose passes are so vigilantly guarded by 
cismontane criticism. Indeed, some sense of the might and majesty of the
 book’s title poem succeeded in crossing the dead-line while watch-worn 
sentinels slept “at their insuperable posts.” Of that work I have the 
temerity to think that in both subject and art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
 it nicks the rock as high as anything of the generation of Tennyson, 
and a good deal higher than anything of the generation of Kipling; and 
this despite its absolute destitution of what contemporary taste insists
 on having—the “human interest.” Naturally, a dramatist of the heavens, 
who takes the suns for his characters, the deeps of space for his stage,
 and eternity for his “historic period,” does not “look into his heart 
and write” emotionally; but there is room in literature for more than 
emotion. In the “other poems” of the book the lower need is supplied 
without extravagance and with no admixture of sentimentality. But what 
we are here concerned with is “A Wine of Wizardry.”</p>
<p>In this remarkable poem the author proves his allegiance to the 
fundamental faith of the greatest of those “who claim the holy Muse as 
mate”—a faith which he has himself “confessed” thus:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Remiss the ministry they bear</div>
<div class="i2">Who serve her with divided heart;</div>
<div class="i2">She stands reluctant to impart</div>
<div class="i0">Her strength to purpose, end, or care.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, as in all his work, we shall look in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
 vain for the “practical,” the “helpful.” The verses serve no cause, 
tell no story, point no moral. Their author has no “purpose, end, or 
care” other than the writing of poetry. His work is as devoid of motive 
as is the song of a skylark—it is merely poetry. No one knows what 
poetry is, but to the enlightened few who know what is poetry it is a 
rare and deep delight to find it in the form of virgin gold. “Gold,” 
says the miner “vext with odious subtlety” of the mineralogist with his 
theories of deposit—“gold is where you find it.” It is no less precious 
whether you have crushed it from the rock, or washed it from the gravel,
 but some of us care to be spared the labor of reduction, or sluicing. 
Mr. Sterling’s reader needs no outfit of mill and pan.</p>
<p>I am not of those who deem it a service to letters to “encourage” 
mediocrity—that is one of the many ways to starve genius. From the 
amiable judgment of the “friendly critic” with his heart in his head, 
otherwise unoccupied, and the <i>laudator literarum</i> who finds every 
month, or every week—according to his employment by magazine or 
newspaper—more great books than I have had the luck to find in a 
half-century, I dissent. My notion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
 is that an age which produces a half-dozen good writers and twenty 
books worth reading is a memorable age. I think, too, that contemporary 
criticism is of small service, and popular acclaim of none at all, in 
enabling us to know who are the good authors and which the good books. 
Naturally, then, I am not overtrustful of my own judgment, nor hot in 
hope of its acceptance. Yet I steadfastly believe and hardily affirm 
that George Sterling is a very great poet—incomparably the greatest that
 we have on this side of the Atlantic. And of this particular poem I 
hold that not in a lifetime has our literature had any new thing of 
equal length containing so much poetry and so little else. It is as full
 of light and color and fire as any of the “ardent gems” that burn and 
sparkle in its lines. It has all the imagination of “Comus” and all the 
fancy of “The Faerie Queene.” If Leigh Hunt should return to earth to 
part and catalogue these two precious qualities he would find them in so
 confusing abundance and so inextricably interlaced that he would fly in
 despair from the impossible task.</p>
<p>Great lines are not all that go to the making of great poetry, but a poem with many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
 great lines is a great poem, even if it have—as usually it has, and as 
“A Wine of Wizardry” has not—prosaic lines as well. To quote all the 
striking passages in Mr. Sterling’s poem would be to quote most of the 
poem, but I will ask the reader’s attention to some of the most graphic 
and memorable.</p>

<p>One of a poet’s most authenticating credentials may be found in his 
epithets. In them is the supreme ordeal to which he must come and from 
which is no appeal. The epithets of the versifier, the mere metrician, 
are either contained in their substantives or add nothing that is worth 
while to the meaning; those of the true poet are instinct with novel and
 felicitous significances. They personify, ennoble, exalt, spiritualize,
 endow with thought and feeling, touch to action like the spear of 
Ithuriel. The prosaic mind can no more evolve such than ditch-water in a
 champagne-glass can sparkle and effervesce, or cold iron give off 
coruscations when hammered. Have the patience to consider a few of Mr. 
Sterling’s epithets, besides those in the lines already quoted:</p>
<p>“Purpled” realm; “striving” billows; “wattled” monsters; “timid” sapphires of the snow; “lit” wastes; a “stainèd” twilight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
 of the South; “tiny” twilight in the jacinth, and “wintry” orb of the 
moonstone; “winy” agate and “banded” onyx; “lustrous” rivers; 
“glowering” pyres of the burning-ghaut, and so forth.</p>
<p>Do such words come by taking thought? Do they come ever to the made 
poet?—to the “poet of the day”—poet by resolution of a “committee on 
literary exercises”? Fancy the poor pretender, conscious of his pretense
 and sternly determined to conceal it, laboring with a brave confusion 
of legs and a copious excretion of honest sweat to evolve felicities 
like these!</p>

</div>
<div class="center">(<i>From “The Cosmopolitan” Magazine, December, 1907</i>)</div>
<p class="drop-cap">WHEN a man of genius who is not famous writes a 
notable poem he must expect one or two of three things: indifference, 
indignation, ridicule. In commending Mr. George Sterling’s “A Wine of 
Wizardry,” published in the September number of this magazine, I had 
this reception of his work in confident expectation and should have 
mistrusted my judgment if it had not followed. The promptitude of the 
chorus of denunciation and scorn has attested the superb character of 
the poet’s work and is most gratifying.</p>
<p>The reason for the inevitable note of dissent is not far to seek; it 
inheres in the constitution of the human mind, which is instinctively 
hostile to what is “out of the common”—and a work of genius is pretty 
sure to be that. It is by utterance of uncommon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
 thoughts, opinions, sentiments and fancies that genius is known. All 
distinction is difference, unconformity. He who is as others are—whose 
mental processes and manner of expression follow the familiar order—is 
readily acceptable because easily intelligible to those whose narrow 
intelligence, barren imagination, and meager vocabulary he shares. “Why,
 that is great!” says that complacent dullard, “the average man,” 
smiling approval. “I have thought that a hundred times myself!”—thereby 
providing abundant evidence that it is not great, nor of any value 
whatever. To “the average man” what is new is inconceivable, and what he
 does not understand affronts him. And he is the first arbiter in 
letters and art. In this “fierce democracie” he dominates literature 
with a fat and heavy hand—a hand that is not always unfamiliar with the 
critic’s pen.</p>
<p>In returning here to the subject of Mr. Sterling’s poem I have no 
intention of expounding and explaining it to persons who know nothing of
 poetry and are inaccessible to instruction. Those who, in the amusing 
controversy which I unwittingly set raging round Mr. Sterling’s name, 
have spoken for them are in equal mental darkness and somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> thicker moral, as it is my humble hope to show.</p>
<p>When the cause to be served is ignorance, the means of service is 
invariably misrepresentation. The champion of offended Dulness falsifies
 in statement and cheats in argument, for he serves a client without a 
conscience. A knowledge of right and wrong is not acquired to-day, as in
 the time of Adam and Eve, by eating an apple; and it is attained by 
only the highest intelligences.</p>
<p>But before undertaking the task of pointing out the moral unworth of 
my honorable opponents, it seems worth while to explain that the 
proponent of the controversy has had the misfortune to misunderstand the
 question at issue. He has repeatedly fallen into the error of 
affirming, with all the emphasis of shouting capitals, that “Ambrose 
Bierce says it [“A Wine of Wizardry”] is the greatest poem ever written 
in America,” and at least once has declared that I pronounced it “the 
only great poem ever written in America.” If the dispute had been 
prolonged I shudder to think that his disobedient understanding might 
have misled him to say that I swore it was the only great poem ever 
written, in all the world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>
<p>To those who know me it is hardly needful, I hope, to explain that I 
said none of the words so generously put into my mouth, for it is 
obvious that I have not seen, and could not have seen, all the poems 
that have been written in America. To have pronounced such a judgment 
without all the evidence would have been to resemble my opponents—which 
God forbid! In point of fact, I do not consider the poem the greatest 
ever written in America; Mr. Sterling himself, for example, has written a
 greater. Exposed to so hardy and impenitent misrepresentation I feel a 
need of the consolations of religion: I should like positively to know 
where my critics are going to when they die. From my present faltering 
faith in their future I derive an imperfect comfort.</p>
<p>Naturally, not all protagonists of the commonplace who have uttered 
their minds about this matter are entitled to notice. The Baseball 
Reporter who, says Mr. Brisbane, “like Mr. Sterling, is a poet,” the 
Sweet Singer of Slang, the Simian Lexicographer of Misinformation, and 
the Queen of Platitudinaria who has renounced the sin-and-sugar of youth
 for the milk-and-morality of age must try to forgive me if I leave them
 grinning through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span> their respective horse-collars to a not unkind inattention.</p>
<p>But Deacon Harvey is a person of note and consequence. On a question 
of poetry, I am told, he controls nearly the entire Methodist vote. 
Moreover, he has a notable knack at mastery of the English language, 
which he handles with no small part of the ease and grace that may have 
distinguished the impenitent thief carrying his cross up the slope of 
Calvary. Let the following noble sentences attest the quality of his 
performance when he is at his best:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>A natural hesitation to undertake analysis of the unanalyzable, 
criticism of the uncriticizable, or, if we may go so far, mention of the
 unmentionable, yields to your own shrewd forging of the links of 
circumstance into a chain of duty. That the greatest poem ever written 
on this hemisphere, having forced its way out of a comfortable lodgment 
in the brain of an unknown author, should be discovered and heralded by a
 connoisseur whose pre-eminence is yet to be established, is perhaps in 
itself not surprising, and yet we must admit that the mere rarity of 
such a happening would ordinarily preclude the necessity, which 
otherwise might exist, of searching inquiry as to the attributed 
transcendentalism of merit.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Surely a man who habitually writes such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
 prose as that must be a good judge of poetry or he would not be a good 
judge of anything in literature. And what does this Prince Paramount of 
grace and clarity find to condemn in poor Mr. Sterling’s poem? Listen 
with at least one ear each:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>We are willing to admit at the outset that in the whole range of 
American, or, for that matter, English, poetry there is no example of a 
poem crowded with such startling imagery, ambitiously marshaled in lines
 of such lurid impressiveness, all of which at once arrest attention and
 would bewilder the esthetic sensibility of a Titan. The poem is made up
 of an unbroken series of sententious and striking passages, any one of 
which would have distinguished a whole canto of Dante or Keats, neither 
of whom would have ventured within that limit to use more than one—such 
was their niggardly economy.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here is something “rich and strange” in criticism. Heretofore it has 
been thought that “wealth of imagery” was about the highest quality that
 poetry could have, but it seems not; that somewhat tiresome phrase is 
to be used henceforth to signify condemnation. Of the poem that we wish 
to commend we must say that it has an admirable poverty of imagination. 
Deacon Harvey’s notion that poets like Dante and Keats deliberately 
refrained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span> from using more 
than one “sententious and striking passage” to the canto “goes neare to 
be fonny.” They used as many as occurred to them; no poet uses fewer 
than he can. If he has only one to a canto, that is not economy; it is 
indigence.</p>
<p>I observe that even so good a poet and so appreciative a reader of 
Mr. Sterling as Miss Ina Coolbrith has fallen into the same error as 
Deacon Harvey. Of “the many pictures presented in that wondrous ‘Wine of
 Wizardry,’” this accomplished woman says: “I think it is a ‘poem’—a 
great poem—but one which, in my humble estimate, might have been made 
even greater could its creator have permitted himself to drop a little 
of what some may deem a weakening superfluity of imagery and 
word-painting.”</p>
<p>If one is to make “pictures” in poetry one must do so by 
word-painting. (I admit the hatefulness of the term “word-painting,” 
through overuse of the name in praise of the prose that the thing 
defaces, but it seems that we must use it here.) Only in narrative and 
didactic poetry, and these are the lowest forms, can there be too much 
of imagery and word-painting; in a poem essentially graphic, like the 
one under consideration, they are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
 strength and soul of the work. “A Wine of Wizardry” is, and was 
intended to be, a series, a succession, of unrelated pictures, colored 
(mostly red, naturally) by what gave them birth and being—the reflection
 of a sunset in a cup of ruddy wine. To talk of too much imagery in a 
work of that kind is to be like Deacon Harvey.</p>
<p>Imagery, that is to say, imagination, is not only the life and soul 
of poetry; it is the poetry. That is what Poe had in mind doubtless, 
when he contended that there could be no such thing as a long poem. He 
had observed that what are called long poems consist of brief poetical 
passages connected by long passages of metrical prose—<i>recitativo</i>—of
 oases of green in deserts of gray. The highest flights of imagination 
have always been observed to be the briefest. George Sterling has 
created a new standard, another criterion. In “A Wine of Wizardry,” as 
in his longer and greater poem, “The Testimony of the Suns,” there is no
 <i>recitativo</i>. His imagination flies with a tireless wing. It never
 comes to earth for a new spring into the sky, but like the eagle and 
the albatross, sustains itself as long as he chooses that it shall. His 
passages of poetry are connected by passages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
 of poetry. In all his work you will find no line of prose. Poets of the
 present and the future may well “view with alarm” as Statesman Harvey 
would say—the work that Sterling has cut out for them, the pace that he 
has set. Poetry must henceforth be not only qualitative but 
quantitative: it must be <i>all</i> poetry. If wise, the critic will 
note the new criterion that this bold challenge to the centuries has 
made mandatory. The “long poem” has been shown to be possible; let us 
see if it become customary.</p>
<p>In affirming Mr. Sterling’s primacy among living American poets I 
have no apology to offer to the many unfortunates who have written to me
 in the spirit of the man who once said of another: “What! that fellow a
 great man? Why, he was born right in my town!” It is humbly submitted, 
however, that unless the supply of great men is exhausted they must be 
born somewhere, and the fact that they are seen “close to” by their 
neighbors does not supply a reasonable presumption against their 
greatness. Shakspeare himself was once a local and contemporary poet, 
and even Homer is known to have been born in “seven Grecian cities” 
through which he “begged his bread.” Is Deacon Harvey altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
 sure that he is immune to the popular inability to understand that the 
time and place of a poet’s nativity are not decisive as to his rating? 
He may find a difficulty in believing that a singer of supreme 
excellence was born right in <i>his</i> country and period, but in the 
words that I have quoted from him he has himself testified to the fact. 
To be able to write “an unbroken series of sententious and striking 
passages”; to crowd a poem, as no other in the whole range of our 
literature has done, with “startling imagery” “in lines of 
impressiveness,” lurid or not; to “arrest attention”; to “bewilder the 
Titans,” Deacon Harvey at their head—that is about as much as the most 
ambitious poet could wish to accomplish at one sitting. The ordinary 
harpist harping on his Harpers’ would be a long time in doing so much. 
How any commentator, having in those words conceded my entire claim, 
could afterward have the hardihood to say, “The poem has no merit,” 
transcends the limits of human comprehension and passes into the dark 
domain of literary criticism.</p>
<p>Nine in ten of the poem’s critics complain of the fantastic, 
grotesque, or ghastly nature of its fancies. What would these good 
persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> have on the 
subject of wizardry?—sweet and sunny pictures of rural life?—love scenes
 in urban drawing-rooms?—beautiful sentiments appropriate to young 
ladies’ albums?—high moral philosophy with an “appeal” to what is 
“likest God within the soul”? Deacon Harvey (O, I cannot get away from 
Deacon Harvey: he fascinates me!) would have “an interpretation of vital
 truth.” I do not know what that is, but we have his word for it that 
nothing else is poetry. And no less a personage than Mrs. Gertrude 
Atherton demands, instead of wizardry, an epic of prehistoric 
California, or an account of the great fire, preferably in prose, for, 
“this is not an age of poetry, anyway.” Alas, poor Sterling!—damned 
alike for what he wrote and what he didn’t write. Truly, there are 
persons whom one may not hope to please.</p>
<p>It should in fairness be said that Mrs. Atherton confesses herself no
 critic of poetry—the only person, apparently, who is not—but pronounces
 Mr. Sterling a “recluse” who “needs to see more and read less.” From a 
pretty long acquaintance with him I should say that this middle-aged man
 o’ the world is as little “reclusive” as any one that I know, and has 
seen rather more of life than is good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> for him. And I doubt if he would greatly gain in mental stature by unreading Mrs. Atherton’s excellent novels.</p>
<p>Sterling’s critics are not the only persons who seem a bit blinded by
 the light of his genius: Mr. Joaquin Miller, a born poet and as 
great-hearted a man as ever lived, is not quite able to “place” him. He 
says that this “titanic, magnificent” poem is “classic” “in the Homeric,
 the Miltonic sense.” “A Wine of Wizardry” is not “classic” in the sense
 in which scholars use that word. It is all color and fire and movement,
 with nothing of the cold simplicity and repose of the Grecian ideal. 
Nor is it Homeric, nor in the Miltonic vein. It is in no vein but the 
author’s own; in the entire work is only one line suggesting the manner 
of another poet—the last in this passage:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Who leads from hell his whitest queens, arrayed</div>
<div class="i0">In chains so heated at their master’s fire</div>
<div class="i0">That one new-damned had thought their bright attire</div>
<div class="i0">Indeed were coral, till the dazzling dance</div>
<div class="i0">So terribly that brilliance shall enhance.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>That line, the least admirable in the poem, is purely Byronic. Possibly Mr. Miller meant that Sterling’s work is like Homer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> and Milton’s, not in manner, but in excellence; and it is.</p>
<p>Mr. Sterling’s critics may at least claim credit for candor. For 
cause of action, as the lawyers say, they aver his use of strange, 
unfamiliar words. Now this is a charge that any man should be ashamed to
 make; first, because it is untrue; second, because it is a confession 
of ignorance. There are not a half-dozen words in the poem that are not 
in common use by good authors, and none that any man should not blush to
 say that he does not understand. The objection amounts to this: that 
the poet did not write down to the objector’s educational level—did not 
adapt his work to “the meanest capacity.” Under what obligation was he 
to do so? There are men whose vocabulary does not exceed a few hundreds 
of words; they know not the meaning of the others because they have not 
the thoughts that the others express. Shall these Toms, Dicks and Harrys
 of the slums and cornfields set up their meager acquirements as metes 
and bounds beyond which a writer shall not go? Let them stay upon their 
reservations. There are poets enough, great poets, too, whom they can 
partly understand; that is, they can understand the simple language,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
 the rhymes, the meter—everything but the poetry. There are orders of 
poetry, as there are orders of architecture. Because a Grecian temple is
 beautiful shall there be no Gothic cathedrals? By the way, it is not 
without significance that Gothic architecture was first so called in 
derision, the Goths having no architecture. It was named by the Deacon 
Harveys of the period.</p>
<p>The passage that has provoked this class of critics to the most shameless feats of self-exposure is this:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Infernal rubrics, sung to Satan’s might,</div>
<div class="i0">Or chanted to the Dragon in his gyre.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Upon this they have expended all the powers of 
ridicule belonging to those who respect nothing because they know 
nothing. A person of light and leading in their bright band<a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor pginternal" id="FNanchor_2">[2]</a> says of it:</p>
<p>“We confess that we had never before heard of a ‘gyre.’ Looking it up
 in the dictionary, we find that it means a gyration, or a whirling 
round. Rubrics chanted to a dragon while he was whirling ought to be 
worth hearing.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>
<p>Now, whose fault is it that this distinguished journalist had never 
heard of a gyre? Certainly not the poet’s. And whose that in very 
sensibly looking it up he suffered himself to be so misled by the 
lexicographer as to think it a gyration, a whirling round? Gyre means, 
not a gyration, but the path of a gyration, an orbit. And has the poor 
man no knowledge of a dragon in the heavens?—the constellation Draco, to
 which, as to other stars, the magicians of old chanted incantations? A 
peasant is not to be censured for his ignorance, but when he glories in 
it and draws its limit as a dead line for his betters he is the least 
pleasing of all the beasts of the field.</p>
<p>An amusing instance of the commonplace mind’s inability to understand
 anything having a touch of imagination is found in a criticism of the 
now famous lines:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The blue-eyed vampire, sated at her feast,</div>
<div class="i0">Smiles bloodily against the leprous moon.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>“Somehow,” says the critic, who, naturally, is a book-reviewer, “one 
does not associate blue eyes with a vampire.” Of course it did not occur
 to him that this was doubtless the very reason why the author chose the
 epithet—if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> he thought of 
anybody’s conception but his own. “Blue-eyed” connotes beauty and 
gentleness; the picture is that of a lovely, fair-haired woman with the 
telltale blood about her lips. Nothing could be less horrible; nothing 
more terrible. As vampires do not really exist, everyone is at liberty, I
 take it, to conceive them under what outward and visible aspect he 
will; but this gentleman, having standardized the vampire, naturally 
resents any departure from the type—his type. I fancy he requires 
goggle-eyes, emitting flame and perhaps smoke, a mouth well garnished 
with tusks—long claws, and all the other appurtenances that make the 
conventional Chinese dragon so awful that one naturally wishes to meet 
it and kick it.</p>
<p>Between my mind and the minds of those whom Mr. Sterling’s daring 
incursions into the realm of the unreal do not affect with a keen 
artistic delight there is nothing in common—except a part of my 
vocabulary. I cannot hope to convince nor persuade them. Nevertheless, 
it is no trouble to point out that their loud pretense of being 
“shocked” by some of his fancies is a singularly foolish one. We are not
 shocked by the tragic, the terrible, even the ghastly, in literature 
and art. We do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> not flee 
from the theater when a tragedy is enacting—the murder of Duncan and the
 sleeping grooms—the stabbing and poisoning in “Hamlet.” We listen 
without discomposure to the beating to death of Nancy Sykes behind the 
scenes. The Ancient Mariner’s dead comrades rise and pull at the ropes 
without disturbing the reader; even the “slimy things” “crawl with legs 
upon a slimy sea” and we do not pitch the book into the fire. Dante’s 
underworld, with all its ingenious horrors, page after page of them, are
 accounted pretty good reading—at least Dante is accounted a pretty good
 poet. No one stands forth to affirm his distress when Homer’s hero 
declares that</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Swarms of specters rose from deepest hell</div>
<div class="i0">With bloodless visage and with hideous yell.</div>
<div class="i0">They scream, they shriek; sad groans and dismal sounds</div>
<div class="i0">Stun my scared ears and pierce Hell’s utmost bounds.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Literature is full of pictures of the terrible, the 
awful, the ghastly, if you please; hardly a great author but has given 
them to us in prose or verse. They shock nobody, for they produce no 
illusion, not even on the stage, or the canvases of Vereshchagin. If 
they did they would be without artistic value.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>
<p>But it is the fashion to pretend to be horrified—when the terrible 
thing is new and by an unfamiliar hand. The Philistine who accepts 
without question the horrors of Dante’s Hell professes himself greatly 
agitated when Sterling’s</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Satan, yawning on his brazen seat,</div>
<div class="i0">Fondles a screaming thing his fiends have flayed.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="noindent">In point of fact, the poor Philistine himself yawns 
as he reads about it; he is not shocked at all. It is comprehensible how
 there may be such a thing as a mollycoddle, but how one can pretend to 
be a mollycoddle when one is not—that must be accepted as the most 
surprising hypocrisy that we have the happiness to know about.</p>
<p>Having affirmed the greatness of Mr. Sterling, I am austerely 
reminded by a half hundred commentators, some of whom profess admiration
 for “A Wine of Wizardry,” that a single poem, of whatever excellence, 
does not establish the claim. Like nearly all the others, these 
gentlemen write without accuracy, from a general impression. They 
overlook the circumstance that I pointed out a book by Sterling, 
published several years ago,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span> entitled <i>The Testimony of the Suns, and Other Poems</i>. What, then, becomes of the “single poem” sneer? To its performers nothing that they have not seen exists.</p>
<p>That book is dedicated to me—a fact that has been eagerly seized upon
 by still another class of critics to “explain” my good opinion of its 
author; for nothing is so welcome to our literary hill-tribes as a 
chance to cheat by ascription of a foul motive. But it happens, 
unhappily for the prosperity of their hope, that the dedication was made
 in gratitude for my having already set the crown of praise upon its 
author’s head. I will quote the first lines of the dedication, not only 
in proof of this, but to show the noble seriousness and sincerity with 
which a great poet regards his ministry at the altar of his art:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Ah! glad to thy decree I bow,</div>
<div class="i2">From whose unquestioned hand did fall,</div>
<div class="i2">Beyond a lesser to recall,</div>
<div class="i0">The solemn laurels on my brow.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I tremble with the splendid weight.</div>
<div class="i2">To my unworth ’tis given to know</div>
<div class="i2">How dread the charge I undergo</div>
<div class="i0">Who claim the holy Muse as mate.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span></p>
<p>It is to be hoped that Mr. Sterling’s reverent attitude toward his 
art has suffered no abatement from his having been thrown to the swine 
for allegiance to an alien faith hateful to his countrymen.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">I&nbsp;HAVE not the happiness to know if Mr. George 
Bernard Shaw has ever written as good a play as “As You Like It.” He 
says he has, and certainly he ought to be able to remember what plays he
 has written. I don’t know that blank verse is, as Mr. Shaw declares, “a
 thing that you could teach a cat if it had an ear.” My notion is that 
blank verse—good blank verse—is the most difficult of all metrical 
forms, and that among English poets Milton alone has mastered it. I 
don’t know that Mr. Shaw is right in his sweeping condemnation of the 
blank verse of that indubitable “master of tremendous prose,” 
Shakspeare. As a critic, Mr. Shaw ought to know that Shakspeare wrote 
very little blank verse, technically and properly so called, his plays 
being, naturally, mostly in what the prosodian knows, and what as a 
playwright Mr. Shaw might be expected to know, as dramatic blank, a very
 different thing.</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But this I know, and know full well—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>
<p class="noindent">that in ridiculing the blind, unreasoning adoration 
of Shakspeare as an infallible and impeccable god in whose greater glory
 all <i>dii minores</i> must hide their diminished heads and pale their 
uneffectual fires, Mr. Shaw does well and merits sympathetic attention. 
Without going so far as Voltaire, one may venture without irreverence to
 hold an opinion of one’s own as to the great Englishman’s barbarous 
exuberance of metaphor, pure and mixed, his poverty of invention in the 
matter of plots, his love of punning, his tireless pursuit of a quibble 
to the ultimate ramifications of its burrow, and a score of other faults
 which in others his thick-and-thin protagonists freely condemn. Many of
 these sins against art were doubtless the offspring of a giant 
indolence, and sole desire to draw the rabble of the streets into his 
theater. For literature he cared nothing, of literary ambition knew 
nothing—just made plays, played them and flung away the manuscript. Even
 the sonnets were left unsigned—which is fortunate, for his unearthly 
signature would have misled the compiler.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the other qualities of “As You Like It,” Mr. Shaw 
will perhaps admit that in point of mere decency it is pretty fair, 
which is more than any but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
 Shakspearolater will say of “Romeo and Juliet,” for example. Not 
greatly caring for the theater, I am not familiar with “acting 
versions,” but this play as it came from the hand of its author is, in a
 moral sense, detestable. All its men are blackguards, all its women 
worse, and worst of all is Juliet herself, who makes no secret of the 
nature of her passion for Romeo, but discloses it with all the candor of
 a moral idiot insensible to the distinction between propensity and 
sentiment. Her frankness is no less than hideous. Yet one may read page 
after page by reputable authors in praise of her as one of the sweetest 
of Shakspeare’s fascinating heroines. Babes are named for her and 
drawing-room walls adorned with ideal portraits of her, engraved from 
paintings of great artists. One has only to read Taine’s description of 
an Elizabethan theater audience to understand why dramatists of those 
“spacious times” did not need seriously to concern themselves with 
morality; but that Shakspeare’s wit, pathos and poetry can make such 
characters as those of this drama acceptable to modern playgoers and 
readers is the highest possible attestation of the man’s consummate 
genius.</p>

</div>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="drop-cap">IN the history of religious controversy it has 
sometimes occurred that a fool has risen and shouted out views so 
typical and representative as to justify a particular attention denied 
to his less absurd partisans. That was the situation relative to the 
logomachy that raged over the ashes of the late Col. Robert Ingersoll. 
Through the ramp and roar of the churches, the thunder of the 
theological captains and the shouting, rose the penetrating treble of a 
person so artlessly pious, so devoid of knowledge and innocent of sense,
 that his every utterance credentialed him as a child of candor, and 
arrested attention like the wanton shrilling of a noontide locust 
cutting through the cackle of a hundred hens. That he happened to be an 
editorial writer was irrelevant, for it was impossible to suspect so 
ingenuous a soul of designs upon what may be called the Christian vote; 
he simply poured out his heart with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
 unpremeditated sincerity of a wild ass uttering its view of the Scheme 
of Things. I take it the man was providentially “raised up”, and spoke 
by inspiration of the Spirit of Religion.</p>
<p>“Robert G. Ingersoll,” says this son of nature, “was not a <i>great</i> atheist, nor a <i>great</i> agnostic. Dissimilar though they are, he aspired in his published lectures and addresses to both distinctions.”</p>
<p>As it is no distinction to be either atheist or agnostic, this must 
mean that Col. Ingersoll “aspired” to be a great atheist and a great 
agnostic. Where is the evidence? May not a man state his religious or 
irreligious views with the same presumption of modesty and mere 
sincerity that attaches to other intellectual action? Because one 
publicly affirms the inveracity of Moses must one be charged with 
ambition, that meanest of all motives? By denying the sufficiency of the
 evidences of immortality is one self-convicted of a desire to be 
accounted great?</p>
<p>Col. Ingersoll said the thing that he had to say, as I am saying 
this—as a clergyman preaches his sermon, as an historian writes his 
romance: partly for the exceeding great reward of expression, partly, it
 may be, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> the lesser 
profit of payment. We all move along lines of least resistance; because a
 few of us find that this leads up to the temple of fame it does not 
follow that all are seeking that edifice with a conscious effort to 
achieve distinction. If any Americans have appraised at its true and 
contemptible value the applause of the people Robert Ingersoll did. If 
there has been but one such American he was the man.</p>
<p>Now listen to what further this ineffable dolt had to say of him:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>His irreverence, however, his theory of deistical brutality, was a 
mere phantasy, unsustained by scholarship or by reason, and contradicted
 by every element of his personal character. His love for his wife and 
his children, his tenderness towards relatives and friends, would have 
been spurious and repulsive if in his heart he had not accepted what in 
speech he derided and contemned.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here’s richness indeed! Whatever may be said by scholarship and 
reason of a “theory of deistical brutality”, I do not think—I really 
have not the civility to admit—that it is contradicted by a blameless 
life. If it were really true that the god of the Christians is not a 
particularly “nice” god the love of a man for wife and child would not 
necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span> and because of
 that be spurious and repulsive. Indeed, in a world governed by such a 
god, and subject therefore to all the evils and perils of the divine 
caprice and malevolence, such affection would be even more useful and 
commendable than it is in this actual world of peace, happiness and 
security. As the stars burn brightest in a moonless night, so in the 
gloom of a wrath-ruled universe all human affections and virtues would 
have an added worth and tenderness. In order that life might be 
splendored with so noble and heroic sentiments as grow in the shadow of 
disaster and are nourished by the sense of a universal peril and sorrow,
 one could almost wish that some malign deity, omnipotent and therefore 
able to accomplish his purposes without sin and suffering for his 
children, had resisted the temptation to do so and had made this a Vale 
of Tears.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>The Nineteenth Century has produced great agnostics. Strauss the 
German and Renan the Frenchman were specimens of this particular cult. 
But Robert G. Ingersoll belonged to a lower range of scholarship and of 
thought. He had never studied the great German and French critics of the
 Bible. His “Mistakes of Moses” were pervaded by misapprehensions of the
 text of the Pentateuch.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>
<p>It is indubitably true that Ingersoll was inferior in scholarship to 
Strauss and Renan, and in that and genius to the incomparable Voltaire; 
but these deficiencies were not disabilities in the work that he 
undertook. He knew his limitations and did not transgress them. He was 
not self-tempted into barren fields of scholastic controversy where 
common sense is sacrificed to “odious subtlety”. In the work that he 
chose he had no use for the dry-as-dust erudition of the modern German 
school of Biblical criticism—learned, ingenious, profound, admirable and
 futile. He was accomplished in neither Hebrew nor Greek. Aramaic was to
 him an unknown tongue, and I dare say that if asked he would have 
replied that Jesus Christ, being a Jew, spoke Hebrew. The “text of the 
Pentateuch” was not “misapprehended” by him; he simply let it alone. 
What he criticised in “The Mistakes of Moses” is the English version. If
 that is not a true translation let those concerned to maintain its 
immunity from criticism amend it. They are not permitted to hold that it
 is good enough for belief and acceptance, but not good enough to 
justify an inexpert dissent. Ingersoll’s limitations were the source of 
his power; at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span> they 
confined him to methods that are “understanded of the people”; and to be
 comprehended by the greatest number of men should be the wish of him 
who tries to destroy what he thinks a popular delusion. By the way, I 
observe everywhere the immemorial dog’s-eared complaint that he could 
“tear down” (we Americans always prefer to say this when we mean pull 
down) but could not “build up.” I am not aware that he ever tried to 
“build up.” Believing that no religion was needful, he would have 
thought his work perfect if all religions had been effaced. The clamor 
of weak minds for something to replace the errors of which they may be 
deprived is one that the true iconoclast disregards. What he most 
endeavors to destroy is not idols, but idolatry. If in the place of the 
image that he breaks he set up another he would be like a physician who 
having cured his patient of a cramp should inoculate him with an itch. 
It is only just to say that the devout journalist whose holy utterance I
 am afflicting myself with the unhappiness of criticising nowhere makes 
the hoary accusation that Ingersoll could “tear down” but not “build 
up.” He must have overlooked it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>
<p>What Ingersoll attacked was the Bible as we have it—the English 
Bible—not the Bible as it may, can, must, might, would or should be in 
Hebrew and Greek. He had no controversy with scholars—not only knew 
himself unable to meet them on their own ground (where is plenty of room
 for their lonely feet) but was not at all concerned with their faiths 
and convictions, nor with the bases of them. Hoping to remove or weaken a
 few popular errors, he naturally examined the book in which he believed
 them to be found—the book which has the assent and acceptance of those 
who hold them and derive them from it. He did not go behind the record 
as it reads—nobody does excepting its advocates when it has been 
successfully impugned. What has influenced (mischievously, Ingersoll 
believed) the thought and character of the Anglo-Saxon race is not the 
Hebrew Scriptures and the Greek Testament, but the English Bible. The 
fidelity of that to its originals, its self-sufficiency and independence
 of such evidences as only scholarship can bring to its exposition, 
these, as Aristotle would say, are matters for separate consideration. 
If God has really chosen to give his law to his children in tongues that
 only an infinitesimal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span> 
fraction of them can hope to understand—has thrown it down amongst them 
for ignorant translators to misread, interested priesthoods to falsify 
and hardy and imaginative commentators to make ridiculous—has made no 
provision against all this debauching of the text and the spirit of it, 
this must be because he preferred it so; for whatever occurs must occur 
because the Omniscience and Omnipotence permitting it wishes it to 
occur. Such are not the methods of our human legislators, who take the 
utmost care that the laws be unambiguous, printed in the language of 
those who are required to obey them and accessible to them in the 
original text. I’m not saying that this is the better and more sensible 
way; I only say that if the former is God’s way the fact relieves us all
 of any obligation to “restore” the text before discussing it and to 
illuminate its obscurities with the side-lights of erudition. Ingersoll 
had all the scholarship needful to his work: he knew the meaning of 
English words.</p>
<p>Says the complacent simpleton again:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>It was idle for a man to deny the existence of God who confessed and 
proclaimed the principle of fraternity.... The hard conception of 
annihilation had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> place in sentences that were infused with the heat of immortality.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As logic, this has all the charm inhering in the syllogism, All cows 
are quadrupeds; this is a quadruped; therefore, this is a cow. The 
author of that first sentence would express his thought, naturally, 
something like this: All men are brothers; God is their only father; 
therefore, there is a God. The other sentence is devoid of meaning, and 
is quoted only to show the view that this literary lunatic is pleased to
 think that he entertains of annihilation. It is to him a “hard 
conception”; that is to say, the state of unconsciousness which he 
voluntarily and even eagerly embraces every night of his life, and in 
which he remained without discomfort for countless centuries before his 
birth, is a most undesirable state. It is, indeed, so very unwelcome 
that it shall not come to him—he’ll not have it so. Out of nothingness 
he came, but into nothingness he will not return—he’ll die first! Life 
is a new and delightful toy and, faith! he means to keep it. If you’d 
ask him he would say that his immortality is proved by his yearning for 
it; but men of sense know that we yearn, not for what we have, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span> what we have not, and most strongly for what we have not the shadow of a chance to get.</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>Mr. Harry Thurston Peck is different: he is a scholar, a professor of
 Latin in a leading college, an incisive if not very profound thinker, 
and a charming writer. He is a capable editor, too, and has conducted 
one of our foremost literary magazines, in which, as compelled by the 
nature of the business, he has commonly concerned himself mightily with 
the little men capering nimbly between yesterday the begetter and 
to-morrow the destroyer. Sometimes a larger figure strides into the 
field of his attention, but not for long, nor with any very notable 
accretion of clarity in the view. The lenses are not adjusted for large 
objects, which accordingly seem out of focus and give no true image. So 
the observer turns gladly to his ephemera, and we who read him are the 
gainers by his loyalty to his habit and to his public who fixed it upon 
him. But he so far transcended his limitations as to review in the late 
Col. Ingersoll’s the work of a pretty large man. The result is, to many 
of Prof. Peck’s admirers, of whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
 I am one, profoundly disappointing. In both spirit and method it 
suggests the question, Of what real use are the natural gifts, the 
acquirements and opportunities that do so little for the understanding? 
Surely one must sometimes dissent from the generally accepted 
appraisement of “the things we learn in college,” when one observes a 
man like Prof. Peck (a collegian down to the bone tips) feeling and 
thinking after the fashion of a circuit-riding preacher in Southwestern 
Missouri. Let us examine some of his utterances about the great 
agnostic. Speaking of the purity of his personal character, this critic 
says:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>No one has questioned this; and even had it been so questioned the 
fact could not be pertinent to our discussion. Indeed, it is not easy to
 perceive just why his private virtues have been so breathlessly brought
 forward and detailed with so much strenuous insistence; for surely 
husbands who are faithful, fathers who are loving, and friends who are 
generous and sympathetic are not so rare in this our world as to make of
 them phenomena to be noted in the annals of the age.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me entirely obvious why Ingersoll’s friends and 
supporters have persisted in putting testimony on these matters into the
 forefront of the discussion; and entirely relevant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
 such testimony is. Churchmen and religionists in all ages and countries
 have affirmed the necessary and conspicuous immorality of the 
irreligious. No notable unbeliever has been safe from the slanders of 
the pulpit and the church press. And in this country to-day ninety-nine 
of every one hundred “professing Christians” hold that public and 
personal morality has no other basis than the Bible. In this they are 
both foolish and wise: foolish because it is so evidently untrue, and 
wise because to concede its untruth would be to abandon the defense of 
religion as a moral force. If men can be good without religion, and 
scorning religion, then it is not religion that makes men good; and if 
religion does not do this it is of no practical value and one may as 
well be without it as with it, so far as concerns one’s relations with 
one’s fellow men. We are told that Christianity is something more than a
 body of doctrine, that it is a system of ethics, having a divine 
origin; that it has a close and warm relation to conduct, generating 
elevated sentiments and urging to a noble and unselfish life. If in 
support of that view it is relevant to point to the blameless lives of 
its “Founder” and his followers it is equally relevant in contradiction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
 to point to the blameless lives of its opponents. If Prof. Peck finds 
it “not easy to perceive” this he might profitably make some experiments
 in perception on a big, red Pennsylvanian barn.</p>
<p>Prof. Peck tries to be fair; he concedes the honesty of Ingersoll’s belief and acknowledges that</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>It is entitled to the same respect that we accord to the unshaken 
faith of other men. Indeed, for the purpose of the moment we may even go
 still further and assume that he was right; that Christianity is in 
truth a superstition and its history a fable; that it has no hold on 
reason; and that the book from which it draws in part its teaching and 
its inspiration is only an inconsistent chronicle of old-world myths. 
Let us assume all this and let us still inquire what final judgment 
should be passed upon the man who held these views and strove so hard to
 make them universal.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Prof. Peck is not called upon to make any such concessions and 
assumptions. As counsel for the defense, I am as willing to make 
admissions as he, and “for the sake of argument,” as the meaningless 
saying goes, to confess that the religion attacked by my client is 
indubitably true. His justification depends in no degree upon the 
accuracy of his judgment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span> 
but upon his honest confidence in it; and that is unquestioned; that is 
no assumption; it is not conceded but affirmed. If he believed that in 
these matters he was right and a certain small minority of mankind, 
including a considerable majority of his living countrymen, wrong it was
 merely his duty as a gentleman to speak his views and to strive, as 
occasion offered or opportunity served, to “make them universal.” In our
 personal affairs there is such a thing as righteous suppression of the 
truth—even such another thing as commendable falsehood. In certain 
circumstances avowal of convictions is as baleful and mischievous as in 
other circumstances dissimulation is. But in all the large matters of 
the mind—in philosophy, religion, science, art and the like, a lesser 
service to the race than utterance of the truth as he thinks he sees it,
 leaving the result to whatever powers may be, a man has no right to be 
content with having performed, for it is only so that truth is 
established. It was only so that Prof. Peck’s religion was enthroned 
upon the ruins of others—among them one so beautiful that after 
centuries of effacement its myths and memories stir with a wonderful 
power the hearts of scholars and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
 artists of the later and conquering faith. Of that religion it might 
once have been said in deprecation of St. Paul, as, in deprecation of 
Ingersoll, Prof. Peck now says of religion in general:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>Its roots strike down into the very depths of human consciousness. 
They touch the heart, the sympathies and the emotions. They lay strong 
hold on life itself, and they are the chords to which all being can be 
made to vibrate with a passionate intensity which nothing else could 
call to life.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I have said that Prof. Peck tries to be fair; if he had altogether 
succeeded he would have pointed out, not only that Ingersoll sincerely 
believed the Christian religion false, but that he believed it 
mischievous, and that he was persuaded that its devotees would be better
 off with no religion than with any. Had Prof. Peck done that he could 
have spared himself the trouble of writing, and many of his admirers the
 pain of reading, his variants of the ancient and discreditable 
indictment of the wicked incapable who can “tear down,” but not “build 
up.” Agnosticism may be more than a mere negation. It may be, as in 
Ingersoll it was, a passionate devotion to Truth, a consecration of self
 to her service. Of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> a
 one as he it is incredibly false to say that he can only “destroy” and 
“has naught to give.” As well and as truthfully could that be said of 
one who knocks away the chains of a slave and goes his way, imposing no 
others. One may err in doing so. There are as many breeds of men as of 
dogs and horses; and as a cur can not be taught to retrieve nor herd 
sheep, nor a roadster to hunt, so there are human tribes unfit for 
liberty. One’s zeal in liberation may be greater than one’s wisdom, but 
faith in all mankind is at least an honorable error, even when 
manifested by hammering at the shackles of the mind. What Ingersoll 
thought he had to “give” was Freedom—and that, I take it, is quite as 
positive and real as bondage. The reproach of “tearing down” without 
“building up” is valid against nobody but an idolatrous iconoclast. 
Ingersoll was different.</p>
<p>Prof. Peck has a deal to say against Ingersoll’s methods; he does not
 think them sufficiently serious, not to say reverent. This objection 
may be met as Voltaire met it—by authorizing his critic to disregard the
 wit and answer the argument. But Prof. Peck will not admit that 
Ingersoll was witty. He sees nothing in his sallies but “buffoonery,” a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
 word meaning wit directed against one’s self or something that one 
respects. This amazing judgment from the mouth of one so witty himself 
could, but for one thing, be interpreted no otherwise than as evidence 
that he has not read the works that he condemns. That one thing is 
religious bigotry which, abundantly manifest everywhere in the article 
under review, is nowhere so conspicuous as in the intemperate, not to 
say low, language in which the charge of “buffoonery” is made. Who that 
has an open mind would think that it was written of Robert Ingersoll 
that he “burst into the sacred silence of their devotion with the 
raucous bellowing of an itinerant stump-speaker and the clowning of a 
vulgar mountebank”? To those who really know the character of Robert 
Ingersoll’s wit—keen, bright and clean as an Arab’s scimetar; to those 
who know the clear and penetrating mental insight of which such wit is 
the expression and the proof; to those who know how much of gold and how
 little of mud clung to the pebbles that he slung at the Goliaths of 
authority and superstition; to those who have noted the astonishing 
richness of his work in elevated sentiments fitly expressed, his 
opulence of memorable aphorism and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
 fertility of felicitous phrase—to these it will not seem credible that 
such a man can be compared to one who, knowing the infidelity of a 
friend’s wife, would “slap his friend upon the back and tell the story 
with a snicker, in the coarsest language of the brothel, interspersed 
with Rabelaisian jokes.” It is of the nature of wit mercifully to veil 
its splendors from the eyes of its victim. The taken thief sees in his 
captor an unheroic figure. The prisoner at the bar is not a good judge 
of the prosecution. But it is difficult distinctly to conceive a 
scholar, a wit, a critic, an accomplished editor of a literary magazine,
 committing himself to such judgments as these upon work accessible to 
examination and familiar to memory. To paraphrase Pope,</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Who would not laugh if such a man there be?</div>
<div class="i0">Who would not weep if Harry Peck were he?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another “point” that Prof. Peck is not ashamed to make is that 
Ingersoll lectured on religion for money—“in the character of a paid 
public entertainer, for his own personal profit.” And in what character,
 pray, does anybody lecture where there is a charge for admittance? In 
what character have some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
 the world’s greatest authors, scientists, artists and masters of crafts
 generally lectured when engaged to do so by “lyceums,” “bureaus,” or 
individual “managers”? In what character does Prof. Peck conduct his 
valuable and entertaining magazine for instruction and amusement of 
those willing to pay for it? In what character, indeed, does the 
Defender of the Faith put upon the market his austere sense of 
Ingersoll’s cupidity?</p>
<p>Obviously the agnostic’s offence was not lecturing for pay. It was 
not lecturing on religion. It was not sarcasm. It was that, lecturing 
for pay on religion, his sarcasm took a direction disagreeable to Prof. 
Peck, instead of disagreeable to Prof. Peck’s opponents. As a ridiculer 
of infidels and agnostics Ingersoll might have made a great fame and not
 one of his present critics would have tried to dim its lustre with a 
breath, nor “with polluted finger tarnish it.”</p>
<p>Religions are human institutions; at least those so hold who belong 
to none of “the two-and-seventy jarring sects.” Religious faiths, like 
political and social, are entitled to no immunity from examination and 
criticism; all the methods and weapons that are legitimate against other
 institutions and beliefs are legitimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
 against them. Their devotees have not the right to shield themselves 
behind some imaginary special privilege, to exact an exceptional 
exemption. A religion of divine origin would have a right to such 
exemption; its devotees might with some reason assist God to punish the 
crime of <i>lèse majesté</i>; but the divinity of the religion’s origin 
is the very point in dispute, and in holding that it shall be settled 
his way as an assurance of peace its protagonist is guilty of a hardy 
and impenitent impudence. Blasphemy has been defined as speaking 
disrespectfully of <i>my</i> phemy; one does not observe among the 
followers of one faith any disposition to accord immunity from ridicule 
to the followers of another faith. The devoutest Christian can throw mud
 at Buddha without affecting his own good standing with the brethren; 
and if Mahomet were hanged in effigy from the cross of St. Paul’s, 
Protestant Christianity would condemn the act merely as desecration of a
 sacred edifice.</p>
<p>Here is one more quotation from Prof. Peck, the concluding passage of his paper:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>Robert Ingersoll is dead. Death came to him with swiftness and 
without a warning. Whether he was even conscious of his end no man can 
say. It may be that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> before
 the spark grew quite extinct there was for him a moment of 
perception—that one appalling moment when, within a space of time too 
brief for human contemplation, the affrighted mind, as it reels upon the
 brink, flashes its vivid thought through all the years of its existence
 and perceives the final meaning of them all. If such a moment came to 
him, and as the light of day grew dim before his dying eyes his mind 
looked backward through the past, there can have been small consolation 
in the thought, that in all the utterances of his public teaching, and 
in all the phrases of his fervid eloquence, there was nothing that could
 help to make the life of a man on earth more noble, or more spiritual, 
or more truly worth living.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This of a man who taught all the virtues as a duty and a delight!—who
 stood, as no other man among his countrymen has stood, for liberty, for
 honor, for good will toward men, for truth as it was given to him to 
see it, for love!—who by personal example taught patience under 
falsehood and silence under vilification!—who when slandered in debate 
answered not back, but addressed himself to the argument!—whose entire 
life was an inspiration to high thought and noble deed, and whose 
errors, if errors they are, the world can not afford to lose for the 
light and reason that are in them!</p>
<p>The passage quoted is not without eloquence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
 and that literary distinction which its author gives to so much of what
 he writes. Withal it is infinitely discreditable. There is in it a 
distinct undertone of malice—of the same spirit which, among bigots of 
less civility and franker speech, affirms of an irreligious person’s 
sudden death that it was “a judgment of Heaven,” and which gloats upon 
the possibility that he suffered the pangs of a penitence that came, 
thank God! too late to command salvation. It is in the same spirit that 
conceived and keeps in currency the ten-thousand-times-disproved tales 
of the deathbed remorse of Thomas Paine, Voltaire and all the great 
infidels. Indubitably posterity will enjoy the advantage of believing 
the same thing of Ingersoll; and I can not help thinking that in 
suggesting his remorse as only a possibility, instead of relating it as a
 fact attested by piteous appeals for divine mercy, Prof. Peck has 
committed a sin of omission for which on his own deathbed he will 
himself suffer the keenest regret.</p>

<h3 id="THE_SHORT_STORY">THE SHORT STORY</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“THE short story is always distinctly a sketch. It 
can not express what is the one greatest thing in all 
literature—intercommunion of human characters, their juxtapositions, 
their contrasts.... It is not a high form of art, and its present 
extreme popularity bespeaks decadence far more than advance.”</p>
<p>So said Edgar Fawcett, an author of no small note and consequence in 
his day. The one-greatest-things-in-all-literature are as plentiful and 
obvious, apparently, as the sole causes of the decline of the Roman 
power, yet new ones being continually discovered, it is a fair 
presumption that the supply is inexhaustible; and Fawcett, an ingenious 
man, could hardly have failed to find one and catalogue it. The one that
 he would discover was pretty sure to be as good as another and to 
abound in his own work—and Fawcett did not write short stories, but 
exceedingly long ones. So “the intercommunion of human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
 characters,” and so forth, stands. Nevertheless, one fairly great thing
 in all literature is the power to interest the reader. Perhaps the 
author having the other thing can afford to forego that one, but its 
presence is observable, somehow, in much of the work that is devoid of 
that polyonymous element noted by Messrs. Fawcett, Thomas, Richard and 
Henry. Having that fact in mind, and the added fact that in his own 
admirable sonnets (for example) the intercommunion is an absent factor, I
 am disposed to think that Edgar was facetious.</p>
<p>The short story, quoth’a, “is not a high form of art”; and inferably 
the long story—the novel—is. Let us see about that. As all the arts are 
essentially one, addressing the same sensibilities, quickening the same 
emotions and subject to the same law and limitations of human attention,
 it may be helpful to consider some of the arts other than literary and 
see what we can educe from the comparison. It will be admitted, I hope, 
that even in its exterior aspect St. Peter’s Church is a work of high 
art. But is Rome a work of high art? Was it ever, or could it by 
rebuilding be made such? Certainly not, and the reason is that it can 
not all take attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> at 
once. We may know that the several parts are coördinated and 
interrelated, but we do not discern and feel the coördination and 
interrelation. An opera, or an oratorio, that can be heard at a sitting 
may be artistic, but if in the manner of a Chinese play it were extended
 through the evenings of a week or a month what would it be? The only 
way to get unity of impression from a novel is to shut it up and look at
 the covers.</p>
<p>Not only is the novel, for the reason given, and for others, a faulty
 form of art, but because of its faultiness it has no permanent place in
 literature. In England it flourished less than a century and a half, 
beginning with Richardson and ending with Thackeray, since whose death 
no novels, probably, have been written that are worth attention; though 
as to this, one can not positively say, for of the incalculable 
multitude written only a few have been read by competent judges, and of 
these judges few indeed have uttered judgment that is of record. Novels 
are still produced in suspicious abundance and read with fatal acclaim 
but the novel of to-day has no art broader and better than that of its 
individual sentences—the art of style. That would serve if it had style.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>
<p>Among the other reasons why the novel is both inartistic and 
impermanent is this—it is mere reporting. True, the reporter creates his
 plot, incidents and characters, but that itself is a fault, putting the
 work on a plane distinctly inferior to that of history. Attention is 
not long engaged by what could, but did not, occur to individuals; and 
it is a canon of the trade that nothing is to go into the novel that 
might not have occurred. “Probability”—which is but another name for the
 commonplace—is its keynote. When that is transgressed, as in the 
fiction of Scott and the greater fiction of Hugo, the work is romance, 
another and superior thing, addressed to higher faculties with a more 
imperious insistence. The singular inability to distinguish between the 
novel and the romance is one of criticism’s capital ineptitudes. It is 
like that of a naturalist who should make a single species of the 
squirrels and the larks. Equally with the novel, the short story may 
drag at each remove a lengthening chain of probability, but there are 
fewer removes. The short story does not, at least, cloy attention, 
confuse with overlaid impressions and efface its own effect.</p>
<p>Great work has been done in novels. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
 is only to say that great writers have written them. But great writers 
may err in their choice of literary media, or may choose them wilfully 
for something else than their artistic possibilities. It may occur that 
an author of genius is more concerned for gain than excellence—for the 
nimble popularity that comes of following a literary fashion than for 
the sacred credentials to a slow renown. The acclamation of the 
multitude may be sweet in his ear, the clink of coins, heard in its 
pauses, grateful to his purse. To their gift of genius the gods add no 
security against its misdirection. I wish they did. I wish they would 
enjoin its diffusion in the novel, as for so many centuries they did by 
forbidding the novel to be. And what more than they gave might we not 
have had from Virgil, Dante, Tasso, Camoëns and Milton if they had not 
found the epic poem ready to their misguided hands? May there be in 
Elysium no beds of asphodel and moly for its hardy inventor, whether he 
was Homer or “another man of the same name.”</p>
<p>The art of writing short stories for the magazines of the period can 
not be acquired. Success depends upon a kind of inability that must be 
“born into” one—it does not come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
 at call. The torch must be passed down the line by the thumbless hands 
of an illustrious line of prognathous ancestors unacquainted with fire. 
For the torch has neither light nor heat—is, in truth, fireproof. It 
radiates darkness and all shadows fall toward it. The magazine story 
must relate nothing: like Dr. Hern’s “holes” in the luminiferous ether, 
it is something in which nothing can occur. True, if the thing is 
written in a “dialect” so abominable that no one of sense will read, or 
so unintelligible that none who reads will understand, it may relate 
something that only the writer’s kindred spirits care to know; but if 
told in any human tongue action and incident are fatal to it. It must 
provoke neither thought nor emotion; it must only stir up from the 
shallows of its readers’ understandings the sediment which they are 
pleased to call sentiment, murking all their mental pool and effacing 
the reflected images of their natural environment.</p>
<p>The master of this school of literature is Mr. Howells. Destitute of 
that supreme and almost sufficient literary endowment, imagination, he 
does, not what he would, but what he can—takes notes with his eyes and 
ears and “writes them up” as does any other reporter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
 He can tell nothing but something like what he has seen or heard, and 
in his personal progress through the rectangular streets and between the
 trim hedges of Philistia, with the lettered old maids of his 
acquaintance curtseying from the doorways, he has seen and heard nothing
 worth telling. Yet tell it he must and, having told, defend. For years 
he conducted a department of criticism with a purpose single to 
expounding the after-thought theories and principles which are the 
offspring of his own limitations.</p>
<p>Illustrations of these theories and principles he interpreted with 
tireless insistence as proofs that the art of fiction is to-day a finer 
art than that known to our benighted fathers. What did Scott, what did 
even Thackeray know of the subtle psychology of the dear old New England
 maidens?</p>
<p>I want to be fair: Mr. Howells has considerable abilities. He is 
insufferable only in fiction and when, in criticism, he is making 
fiction’s laws with one eye upon his paper and the other upon a 
catalogue of his own novels. When not carrying that heavy load, himself,
 he has a manly enough mental stride. He is not upon very intimate terms
 with the English language, but on many subjects, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
 when you least expect it of him, he thinks with such precision as 
momentarily to subdue a disobedient vocabulary and keep out the wrong 
word. Now and then he catches an accidental glimpse of his subject in a 
side-light and tells with capital vivacity what it is not. The one thing
 that he never sees is the question that he has raised by inadvertence, 
deciding it by implication against his convictions. If Mr. Howells had 
never written fiction his criticism of novels would entertain, but the 
imagination which can conceive him as writing a good story under any 
circumstances would be a precious literary possession, enabling its 
owner to write a better one.</p>
<p>In point of fiction, all the magazines are as like as one vacuum to 
another, and every month they are the same as they were the month 
before, excepting that in their holiday numbers at the last of the year 
their vacuity is a trifle intensified by that essence of all dulness, 
the “Christmas story.” To so infamous a stupidity has popular fiction 
fallen—to so low a taste is it addressed, that I verily believe it is 
read by those who write it!</p>
<p>As certain editors of newspapers appear to think that a trivial incident has investiture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
 of dignity and importance by being telegraphed across the continent, so
 these story-writers of the Reporter School hold that what is not 
interesting in life becomes interesting in letters—the acts, thoughts, 
feelings of commonplace people, the lives and loves of noodles, 
nobodies, ignoramuses and millionaires; of the village vulgarian, the 
rural maiden whose spiritual grace is not incompatible with the habit of
 falling over her own feet, the somnolent nigger, the clay-eating 
“Cracker” of the North Carolinian hills, the society person and the 
inhabitant of south-western Missouri. Even when the writers commit 
infractions of their own literary Decalogue by making their creations 
and creationesses do something picturesque, or say something worth 
while, they becloud the miracle with such a multitude of insupportable 
descriptive details that the reader, like a tourist visiting an 
artificial waterfall at a New England summer place of last resort, pays 
through the nose at every step of his way to the Eighth Wonder. Are we 
given dialogue? It is not enough to report what was said, but the record
 must be authenticated by enumeration of the inanimate objects—commonly 
articles of furniture—which were privileged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
 to be present at the conversation. And each dialogian must make certain
 or uncertain movements of the limbs or eyes before and after saying his
 say. All this in such prodigal excess of the slender allusions 
required, when required at all, for <i>vraisemblance</i> as abundantly 
to prove its insertion for its own sake. Yet the inanimate surroundings 
are precisely like those whose presence bores us our whole lives 
through, and the movements are those which every human being makes every
 moment in which he has the misfortune to be awake. One would suppose 
that to these gentry and ladry everything in the world except what is 
really remarkable is “rich and strange.” They only think themselves able
 to make it so by the sea-change that it will suffer by being thrown 
into the duck-pond of an artificial imagination and thrown out again.</p>
<p>Amongst the laws which Cato Howells has given his little senate, and 
which his little senators would impose upon the rest of us, is an 
inhibitory statute against a breach of this “probability”—and to them 
nothing is probable outside the narrow domain of the commonplace man’s 
most commonplace experience. It is not known to them that all men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
 and women sometimes, many men and women frequently, and some men and 
women habitually, act from impenetrable motives and in a way that is 
consonant with nothing in their lives, characters and conditions. It is 
known to them that “truth is stranger than fiction,” but not that this 
has any practical meaning or value in letters. It is to him of widest 
knowledge, of deepest feeling, of sharpest observation and insight, that
 life is most crowded with figures of heroic stature, with spirits of 
dream, with demons of the pit, with graves that yawn in pathways leading
 to the light, with existences not of earth, both malign and 
benign—ministers of grace and ministers of doom. The truest eye is that 
which discerns the shadow and the portent, the dead hands reaching, the 
light that is the heart of the darkness, the sky “with dreadful faces 
thronged and fiery arms.” The truest ear is that which hears</p>

<p class="noindent">than he can discern and expound the immutable law underlying coincidence.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that I have written a novel—which God forbid that I 
should do. In the last chapter my assistant hero learns that the 
hero-in-chief has supplanted him in the affections of the shero. He 
roams aimless about the streets of the sleeping city and follows his 
toes into a silent public square. There after appropriate mental agonies
 he resolves in the nobility of his soul to remove himself forever from a
 world where his presence can not fail to be disagreeable to the lady’s 
conscience. He flings up his hands in mad disquietude and rushes down to
 the bay, where there is water enough to drown all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
 such as he. Does he throw himself in? Not he—no, indeed. He finds a tug
 lying there with steam up and, going aboard, descends to the fire-hold.
 Opening one of the iron doors of the furnace, which discloses an 
aperture just wide enough to admit him, he wriggles in upon the glowing 
coals and there, with never a cry, dies a cherry-red death of 
unquestionable ingenuity. With that the story ends and the critics 
begin.</p>
<p>It is easy to imagine what they say: “This is too much”; “it insults 
the reader’s intelligence”; “it is hardly more shocking for its atrocity
 than disgusting for its cold-blooded and unnatural defiance of 
probability”; “art should have some traceable relation to the facts of 
human experience.”</p>
<p>Well, that is exactly what occurred once in the stoke-hold of a tug lying at a wharf in San Francisco. <i>Only</i>
 the man had not been disappointed in love, nor disappointed at all. He 
was a cheerful sort of person, indubitably sane, ceremoniously civil and
 considerate enough (evidence of a good heart) to spare whom it might 
concern any written explanation defining his deed as “a rash act.”</p>
<p>Probability? Nothing is so improbable as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
 what is true. It is the unexpected that occurs; but that is not saying 
enough; it is also the unlikely—one might almost say the impossible. 
John, for example, meets and marries Jane. John was born in Bombay of 
poor but detestable parents; Jane, the daughter of a gorgeous hidalgo, 
on a ship bound from Vladivostok to Buenos Ayres. Will some gentleman 
who has written a realistic novel in which something so nearly out of 
the common as a wedding was permitted to occur have the goodness to 
figure out what, at their birth, were the chances that John would meet 
and marry Jane? Not one in a thousand—not one in a million—not one in a 
million million! Considered from a view-point a little anterior in time,
 it was almost infinitely unlikely that any event which has occurred 
would occur—any event worth telling in a story. Everything being so 
unearthly improbable, I wonder that novelists of the Howells school have
 the audacity to relate anything at all. And right heartily do I wish 
they had not.</p>
<p>Fiction has nothing to say to probability; the capable writer gives it not a moment’s attention, except to make what is related <i>seem</i> probable in the reading—<i>seem</i> true. Suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
 he relates the impossible; what then? Why, he has but passed over the 
line into the realm of romance, the kingdom of Scott, Defoe, Hawthorne, 
Beckford and the authors of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>—the land of the 
poets, the home of all that is good and lasting in the literature of the
 imagination. Do these little fellows, the so-called realists, ever 
think of the goodly company which they deny themselves by confining 
themselves to their clumsy feet and pursuing their stupid noses through 
the barren hitherland, while just beyond the Delectable Mountains lies 
in light the Valley of Dreams, with its tall immortals, poppy-crowned? 
Why, the society of the historians alone would be a distinction and a 
glory!</p>

<h3 id="WHO_ARE_GREAT">WHO ARE GREAT?</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE question having been asked whether Abraham 
Lincoln was the greatest man this country ever produced, a contemporary 
writer signifies his own view of the matter thus:</p>
<p>“Abraham Lincoln was a great man, but I am inclined to believe that history will reckon George Washington a greater.”</p>
<p>But that is an appeal to an incompetent arbiter. History has always 
elevated to primacy in greatness that kind of men—men of action, 
statesmen and soldiers. In my judgment neither of the men mentioned is 
entitled to the distinction. I should say that the greatest American 
that we know about, if not George Sterling, was Edgar Allan Poe. I 
should say that the greatest man is the man capable of doing the most 
exalted, the most lasting and most beneficial intellectual work—and the 
highest, ripest, richest fruit of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
 human intellect is indubitably great poetry. The great poet is the king
 of men; compared with him, any other man is a peasant; compared with 
his, any other man’s work is a joke. What is it likely that remote ages 
will think of the comparative greatness of Shakspeare and the most 
eminent of all Britain’s warriors or statesmen? Nothing, for knowledge 
of the latter’s work will have perished. Who was the greatest of 
Grecians before Homer? Because you are unable to mention offhand the 
names of illustrious conquerors or empire-builders of the period do you 
suppose there were none? Their work has perished, that is all—as will 
perish the work of Washington and Lincoln. But the <i>Iliad</i> is with us.</p>
<p>Their work has perished and our knowledge of it. Why? Because no 
greater man made a record of it. If Homer had celebrated their deeds 
instead of those of his dubious Agamemnon and impossible Achilles, we 
should know about them—all that he chose to tell. For a comparison 
between their greatness and his the data would be supplied by himself. 
Men of action owe their fame to men of thought. The glory of the ruler, 
the conqueror or the statesman belongs to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
 historian or the poet who made it. He can make it big or little, at his
 pleasure; he upon whom it is bestowed is as powerless in the matter as 
is any bystander. If there were no writers how would you know that there
 was a Washington or a Lincoln? How would you know that there is a 
Joseph Choate, who was American Ambassador to Great Britain, or a Nelson
 Miles, sometime Commander of our army? Suppose the writers of this 
country had in 1896 agreed never again to mention the name of William J.
 Bryan; where would have been his greatness?</p>
<p>Great writers make great men or unmake them—or can if they like. They
 kindle a glory where they please, or quench it where it has begun to 
shine. History’s final judgment of Washington and Lincoln will depend 
upon the will of the immortal author who chooses to write of them. Their
 deeds, although a thousand times more distinguished, their popularity, 
though a thousand times greater, can not save from oblivion even so much
 as their names. And nothing that they built will abide. Of the “topless
 towers” of empire that the one assisted to erect, and the other to 
buttress, not a vestige will remain. But what can efface “The Testimony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span> of the Suns”? Who can unwrite “To Helen”?</p>
<p>If there had been no Washington, American independence would 
nevertheless have been won and the American republic established. But 
suppose that he alone had taken up arms. He was neither indispensable 
nor sufficient. Without Lincoln the great rebellion would have been 
subdued and negro slavery abolished. What kind of greatness is that—to 
do what another could have done, what was bound to be done anyhow? I 
call it pretty cheap work. Great statesmen and great soldiers are as 
common as flies; the world is lousy with them. We recognize their 
abundance in the saying that the hour brings the man. We do not say that
 of a literary emergency. There the demand is always calling for the 
supply, and usually calling in vain. Once or twice in a century, it may 
be, the great man of thought comes, unforeseen and unrecognized, and 
makes the age and the glory thereof all his own by saying what none but 
he could say—delivering a message which none but he could bear. All 
round him swarm the little great men of action, laying sturdily about 
them with mace and sword, changing boundaries which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
 afterward changed back again, serving fascinating principles from which
 posterity turns away, building states that vanish like castles of 
cloud, founding thrones and dynasties with which Time plays at 
pitch-and-toss. But through it all, and after it all, the mighty thought
 of the man of words flows on and on with the resistless sweep of “the 
great river where De Soto lies”—an unchanging and unchangeable current 
of eternal good.</p>

poet, Mr. Edgar Fawcett, stamped in vain; but a touch on a book, and lo!
 old Omar is broad awake and with him wakens Israfel, “whose 
heart-strings are a lute.”</p>
<p>Art and literature are the only things of permanent interest in this world. Kings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
 conquerors rise and fall; armies move across the stage of history and 
disappear in the wings; mighty empires are evolved and dissolved; 
religions, political systems, civilizations flourish, die and, except in
 so far as gifted authors may choose to perpetuate their memory, are 
forgotten and all is as before. But the thought of a great writer passes
 from civilization to civilization and is not lost, although his known 
work, his very name, may perish. You can not unthink a thought of Homer,
 but the deeds of Agamemnon are long undone, and the only value that he 
has, the only interest, is that he serves as material for poets. Of 
Cæsar’s work only that of the pen survives. If a statue by Phidias, or a
 manuscript by Catullus, were discovered to-day the nations of Europe 
would be bidding against one another for its possession to-morrow—as one
 day the nations of Africa may bid for a newly discovered manuscript of 
some one now long dead and forgotten. Literature and art are about all 
that the world really cares for in the end; those who make them are not 
without justification in regarding themselves as masters in the House of
 Life and all others as their servitors. In the babble and clamor, the 
pranks and antics of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> its 
countless incapables, the tremendous dignity of the profession of 
letters is overlooked; but when, casting a retrospective eye into “the 
dark backward and abysm of time” to where beyond these voices is the 
peace of desolation, we note the majesty of the few immortals and 
compare them with the pigmy figures of their contemporary kings, 
warriors and men of action generally—when across the silent battle

<h3 id="POETRY_AND_VERSE">POETRY AND VERSE</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">LOVE of poetry is universal, but this is not saying 
much; for men in general love it not as poetry, but as verse—the form in
 which it commonly finds utterance, and in which its utterance is most 
acceptable. Not that verse is essential to poetry; on the contrary, some
 of the finest poetry extant (some of the passages of the Book of Job, 
in the English version, for familiar examples) is neither metric nor 
rhythmic. I am not quite sure, indeed, but the best test of poetry yet 
discovered might not be its persistence or disappearance when clad in 
the garb of prose. In this opinion I differ, though with considerable 
reluctance, with General Lucius Foote, who asserts that “every feature 
which makes poetry to differ from prose is the result of expression.” 
This dictum he has fortified by but a single example: he puts a stanza 
of Tennyson’s “Charge of the Light Brigade” into very good prose. Now, 
for one who has at times come so perilously near to writing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
 genuine poetry as has General Foote, this is a little too bad. Surely 
no man of so competent literary judgment ever before affected to believe
 that Tennyson’s resonant patriotic lines were poetry, in any sense. 
They are, however, a little less distant from it in General Foote’s 
prose version—“There were some cannons on the right, and some on the 
left, and some in front, and they fired with a great noise”—than they 
are in the original. And I have the hardihood to add that as a rule the 
“old favorites” of the lyceum—the ringing and rhetorical curled darlings
 of the public—the “Address to the American Flag,” “The Bells,” the 
“Curfew Must Not Ring To-night,” and all the ghastly lot of them, are 
very rubbishy stuff, indeed. There are exceptions, unfortunately, but to
 a cultivated taste—the taste of a mind that not only knows what it 
likes, but knows and can definitely state why it likes it—nine in ten of
 them are offencive. I say it is unfortunate that there are exceptions. 
It is unfortunate as impairing the beauty and symmetry of the rule, and 
unfortunate for the authors of the exceptional poems, who must endure 
through life the consciousness that their popularity is a cruel 
injustice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>
<p>Far be it from me to underrate the value of the delicate and 
difficult art of managing words. It is to poetry what color is to 
painting. The thought is the outline drawing, which, if it be great, no 
dauber who stops short of actually painting it out can make wholly mean,
 but to which the true artist with his pigments can add a higher glory 
and a new significance. No one who has studied style as a science and 
endeavored to practice it as an art; no one who knows how to select with
 subtle skill the word for the place; who balances one part of his 
sentence against another; who has an alert ear for the harmony of stops,
 cadences and inflections, orderly succession of accented syllables and 
recurrence of related sounds—no one, in short, who knows how to write 
prose can hold in light esteem an art so nearly allied to his own as 
that of poetic expression, including as it does the intricate one of 
versification, which itself embraces such a multitude of dainty wisdoms.
 But expression is not all; while, on the one hand, it can no more make a
 poetic idea prosaic than it can make falsehood of truth, so, on the 
other, it is unable to elevate and beautify a sentiment essentially 
vulgar or base. The experienced miner will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
 no more surely detect the presence of gold in the rough ore than a 
trained judgment the noble sentiment in the crude or ludicrous verbiage 
in which ignorance or humor may have cast it; and the terrier will with 
no keener nose penetrate the disguise of the rat that has rolled in a 
bed of camomile than the practiced intelligence detect the pauper 
thought masquerading in fine words. The mind that does not derive a 
quiet gratification from the bald statement that the course of the 
divine river Alph was through caves of unknown extent, whence it fell 
into a dark ocean, will hardly experience a thrill of delight when told 
by Coleridge that</p>

<div class="i0">Alph, the sacred river, ran</div>

<p class="noindent">have disdained to be told by some lesser Shakspeare 
that he had observed mornings so fine that the mountains blushed with 
pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span> to be noticed by 
them. Poetry is too multiform and many sided for anyone to dogmatize 
upon single aspects and phases of it as if they were the whole; it has 
as many shapes as Proteus, and as many voices as a violin. It sometimes 
thunders and sometimes it prattles; it shouts and exults, but on 
occasion it can whisper. Crude and harsh at one time, the voice of the 
muse is at another smooth, soft, exquisite, luxurious; and again 
scholarly and polite. There is ornate poetry, like the façade of a 
Gothic cathedral, and there is poetry like a Doric temple. Poems there 
are which blaze like a parterre of all brilliant flowers, and others as 
chaste and pallid as the white lily. It is all good (though I hasten to 
explain with some alarm that I do not think all verse is good) but the 
best minds are best agreed in awarding the palm to poetry that is most 
severely simple in diction—in which are fewest “inversions”—from which 
words of new coinage and compounding are rigorously excluded, and the 
old are used in their familiar sense; poetry, that is to say, that 
differs least in expression from the best prose. A truly poetic line—a 
line that I never tire of repeating to myself—is this from Byron:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And the big rain comes dancing to the earth.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="noindent">It is from the description of a storm in the Alps, 
in “Childe Harold.” I will quote the whole stanza in order that the 
reader may be reminded how much of the excellence of this line depends 
upon its context:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">And this is in the night—most glorious night!</div>
<div class="i4">Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be</div>
<div class="i2">A sharer in thy fierce and far delight—</div>
<div class="i4">A portion of the tempest and of thee!</div>
<div class="i2">How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,</div>
<div class="i4">And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!</div>
<div class="i2">And now again ’tis black—and now the glee</div>
<div class="i4">Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,</div>
<div class="i0">As if they did rejoice o’er a young earthquake’s birth.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="noindent">It would not be difficult, were it worth while, to 
point out in this stanza almost as many faults as it has lines; after 
the “lit lake” the “phosphoric sea”—a simile that repeats the image and 
debauches it—is singularly execrable, and the “young earthquake’s birth”
 is almost as bad; but all the imperfections of the stanza count for 
nothing, for they are redeemed by its merits, and particularly by that 
one splendid line. Yet how could the thought it holds be more baldly 
stated? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span> only stipulate 
that the rain shall be “big,” and “dancing” seem to be the manner of its
 approach. With these not very hard, and perfectly fair, conditions let 
ingenuity do its malevolent worst to vulgarize that thought. These few 
instances prove, I hope, that poetry, whatever it is, is something more 
than “words, words, words”—that there is such a thing as poetry of the 
thought.</p>
<p>But let us take a different kind of example. If poetry is all in the 
manner, as General Foote avers, expression must be able to create poetry
 out of anything; at least, no line has been drawn between the prosaic 
ideas upon which expression can work its miracle and those upon which it
 can not. I am, therefore, justified by a familiar law of logic in 
assuming that it is meant that expression, by the mere magic of method, 
can make any idea poetical. Now, I beg most respectfully to submit the 
following problems to be “worked out” by believers in that dictum: Make 
poetry of the thought that—</p>
<p>(1) Glue is made from the hoofs of cattle, and (2) silk purses by macerating the ears of sows in currant jelly.</p>
<p>If anyone will build a superstructure of poetry upon either of those “ideas” as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span> foundation I will be first and loudest in calling attention to the glory of the edifice.</p>
<p>I have said that men in general do not love poetry as poetry, but as 
verse. They are pleased with verse, but if the verse contain poetry they
 like it none the better for that. To the vast majority of the readers 
of even the higher class newspapers, verse and poetry are terms strictly
 synonymous. The pleasure they get from metre and rhyme is merely 
physical or sensual. It is much the same kind of pleasure as that 
derived from the clatter of a drum and the rhythmic clash of cymbals, 
and altogether inferior to the delight that the other instruments of a 
band produce. Emerson, I believe, accounts for our delight in metrical 
composition by supposing metre to have some close relation to the 
rhythmical recurrences within our physical organization—respiration, the
 pulse-beat, etc. No doubt he is right, and if so we need not take the 
trouble to deride the easy-going intellect that is satisfied with sound 
for sentiment whenever the sound is in harmony with the physical nature 
that perceives it, for in such sounds is a natural charm. The old lady 
who found so much Christian comfort in pronouncing the word 
“Mesopotamia” was nobody’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span> fool; the word consists of two pure dactyls.</p>
<p>For an example of the satisfaction the ordinary mind takes in mere 
metre there is nothing better than the senseless refrains of popular 
songs—things which make not even the pretense of containing ideas. From 
the “hey ding a ding” of Shakspeare and the “luddy, fuddy,” etc., of Mr.
 Lester Wallack’s famous thieves’ song in “Rosedale,” to the “whack 
fol-de-rol” of inferior and less original composers, they are all alike 
in appealing to nothing in the world but the sense of time. And in this 
they differ in no essential particular from the verses in the 
newspapers; for such ideas as these contain—and God knows they are 
harmless—are probably never perfectly grasped by the reader, who, when 
he has finished his “poem,” is very sure to be unable to tell you what 
it is all about. I have proved this by repeated experiments, and I 
believe I am not far wrong on the side of immoderation in saying that of
 every one hundred adults who can read and write with ease, there are 
ninety and nine to whom poetry is a sealed book—who not only do not 
recognize it when read, but do not understand it when pointed out. There
 is hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span> any subject on 
which the ignorance of educated persons is more deep, dark and 
universal. And in one sense it is hopeless. By no set instruction can a 
knowledge of poetry be gained. It is (to those having the capacity) a 
result of general refinement—the fruit of a taste and judgment that come
 of culture. The difficulty of imparting it is immensely enhanced by the
 want of a definition. If one have gift and knowledge it is easy enough 
to say what is poetry, but not so easy to say what poetry is.</p>
<p>Hunters have a saying that a deer is safe from the man that never 
misses. Likewise it may be said that the faultless poet gets no readers;
 for, as the hunter can never miss only by never firing, so the poet can
 avoid faults only by not writing. There is no such thing in art or 
letters as attainable perfection; the utmost that any man can hope to do
 is to make the sum and importance of his excellences so exceed the sum 
and importance of his faults that the general impression shall seem 
faultless—that the good shall divert attention from the bad in the 
contemplation and efface it in the recollection. In considering the 
character of a particular work and assigning it to its true place 
amongst works of similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> 
scope and design, we must, indeed, balance merits against demerits, 
endeavoring in such a general way as the nature of the problem permits, 
to say which preponderate, and to what extent, making allowance in 
censure and modification in praise. But the author of the work is to be 
rightly judged by a different method, and he who has done great work is 
great, despite the number and magnitude of his failures and 
imperfections. These may serve to point a moral or illustrate a 
principle by its violation, but they do not and can not dim the glory of
 the better performance. Is he not a strong man who can lift a thousand 
pounds, notwithstanding that in acquiring the ability he failed a 
hundred times to lift the half of it? Who was the strongest man in the 
world—he who once lifted the greatest weight, or he who twice lifted the
 second greatest? The author of “Paradise Lost” wrote afterward 
“Paradise Regained.” He who wrote a poem called “In Memoriam” wrote a 
thing called “The Northern Farmer.” Of what significance is that? Shall 
we count also a man’s washing-list against him? Suppose that Byron had 
not written the “Hours of Idleness”—would that have enhanced the value 
of “Childe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span> Harold”? Is our
 hoard of Shakspearean pure gold the smaller because from the mine 
whence it came came also some of the base metal of “Titus Andronicus”? 
Surely it does not matter whether the hand that at one time wrote the 
lines “To Helen” was at another time writing “The Bells” or whittling a 
pine shingle. Literature is not like a game of billiards, in which the 
player is rated according to his average. In estimating the relative 
altitudes of mountain peaks we look no lower than their summits.</p>
<p>In judging men by this broader method than that which we apply to 
their work we do but practice that method whereby posterity arrives at 
judgments so just and true that in their prediction consists the whole 
science of criticism. To anticipate the verdict of posterity—that is all
 the most daring critic aspires to do, and to do that he should strive 
to exclude the evidence that posterity will not hear. Posterity is a 
tribunal in which there will be no testimony for the prosecution except 
what is inseparable from the strongest testimony for the defence. It 
will consider no man’s bad work, for none will be extant. Nay, it will 
not even attend to the palliating or aggravating circumstances of his 
life and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> surroundings, for
 these too will have been forgotten; if not lost from the records they 
will be whelmed under mountains of similar or more important 
matter—Pelion upon Ossa of accumulated “literary materials.”</p>
<p>These are points to which the critics do not sufficiently attend—do 
not, indeed, attend at all. They endeavor to anticipate the judgment of 
posterity by a method as unlike posterity’s as their judgment and 
ingenuity can make it. They attentively study their poet’s private life 
and his relation to the time and its events in which he lived. They go 
to his work for the key to his character, and return to his character 
for the key to his work, then ransack his correspondence for side-lights
 on both. They paw dusty records and forgotten archives; they thumb and 
dog’s-ear the libraries; and he who can turn up an original document or 
hitherto unnoted fact exults in the possession of an advantage over his 
fellows that will justify the publication of another volume to befog the
 question. Then comes posterity, calmly overlooks the entire mass of 
ingenious irrelevance, fixes a tranquil eye upon those lines which the 
poet has inscribed the highest, and determines his mental stature as 
simply, as surely and with as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span> little assistance as Daniel discerning the hand of God in the letters blazing upon the palace wall.</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>The world is nearly all discovered, mapped and described. In the hot 
hearts of two continents, and the “thrilling regions of thick-ribbed 
ice” about the poles, uncertainty still holds sway over a lessening 
domain, and there Fancy waves her joyous wing unclipped by knowledge. As
 in the material world, so in the world of mind. The daring incursions 
of conjecture have been followed and discredited by the encroachments of
 science, whereby the limits of the unknown have been narrowed to such 
mean dimensions that imagination has lost her free, exultant stride, and
 moves with mincing step and hesitating heart.</p>
<p>I do not mean to say that to-day knows much more that is worth 
knowing than did yesterday, but that with regard to poetry’s 
materials—the visible and audible without us, and the emotional 
within—we have compelled a revelation of Nature’s secrets, and found 
them uninteresting to the last degree. To the modern “instructed 
understanding”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span> she has 
something of the air of a detected impostor, and her worshipers have 
neither the sincerity that comes from faith, nor the enthusiasm that is 
the speech of sincerity. The ancients not only had, as Dr. Johnson said,
 “the first rifling of the beauties of Nature”; they had the immensely 
greater art advantage of ignorance of her dull, vulgar and hideous 
processes, her elaborate movements tending nowhither, and the aimless 
monotony of her mutations. The telescope had not pursued her to the 
heights, nor the microscope dragged her from her ambush. The 
meteorologists had not analyzed her temper, nor constructed mathematical
 formulæ to forecast her smiles and frowns. Mr. Edison had not arrived 
to show that the divine gift of speech (about the only thing that 
distinguishes men, parrots, and magpies from the brutes) is also an 
attribute of metal. In the youth of the world they had, in short, none 
of the disillusionizing sciences with which a critical age, delving 
curiously about the roots of things, has sapped the substructure of 
religion and art alike. I do not regret the substitution of knowledge 
for conjecture, and doubt for faith; I only say that it has its 
disadvantages, and among them we reckon the decay of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span> poesy. In an enlightened age, Macaulay says,</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>Men will judge and compare; but they will not create. They will talk 
about the old poets, and comment on them, and to a certain extent enjoy 
them. But they will scarcely be able to conceive the effect which poetry
 produced on their ruder ancestors, the agony, the ecstasy, the 
plenitude of belief. The Greek rhapsodists, according to Plato, could 
scarce recite Homer without falling into convulsions. The Mohawk hardly 
feels the scalping-knife while he shouts his death-song. The power which
 the ancient bards of Wales and Germany exercised over their auditors 
seems to modern readers almost miraculous. Such feelings are very rare 
in a civilized community, and most rare among those who participate most
 in its improvements. They linger among the peasantry.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>While it is true in a large sense that the world’s greatest poets 
have lived in rude ages, when their races were not long emerged from the
 night of barbarism—like birds the poets sing best at sunrise—it must 
not be supposed that similarly favorable conditions are supplied to a 
rude individual intelligence in an age of polish. With a barbarous age 
that had recently set its face to the dawn a Joaquin Miller would have 
been in full sympathy, and might have interpreted its spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span> in songs of exceeding splendor. But the very qualities that would have made him <i>en rapport</i>
 with such an era make him an isolated voice in ours; while Tennyson, 
the man of culture, full of the disposition of his time—albeit the same 
is of less adequate vitality—touches with a valid hand the harp which 
the other beats in vain. The altar is growing cold, the temple itself 
becoming a ruin; the divine mandate comes with so feeble and faltering a
 voice that the priest has need of a trained and practiced ear to catch 
it and the gift of tongues to impart its meaning to a generation 
concerned with the unholy things whose voice is prose. As a poetical 
mental attitude, that of doubt is meaner than that of faith, that of 
speculation less commanding than that of emotion; yet the poet of to-day
 must assume them, and “In Memoriam” attests the wisdom of him who 
“stoops to conquer”—loyally accepting the hard conditions of his epoch, 
and bending his corrigible genius in unquestioning assent to the three 
thousand and thirty-nine articles of doubt.</p>
<p>As inspiration grows weak and acceptance disobedient, form of 
delivery becomes of greater moment; in so far as it can, the munificence
 of manner must mitigate the poverty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
 of matter; so it occurs that the poets of later life excel their 
predecessors in the delicate and difficult arts and artifices of 
versification as much as they fall below them in imagination and power.</p>

<h3 id="THOUGHT_AND_FEELING">THOUGHT AND FEELING</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“WHAT is his idea?—what thought does he express?” 
asks—rather loftily—a distinguished critic and professor of English 
literature to whom I submitted a brief poem of Mr. Loveman. I had not 
known that Mr. Loveman (of whom, by the way, I have not heard so much as
 I expect to) had tried to express a thought; I had supposed that his 
aim was to produce an emotion, a feeling. That is all that a poet—as a 
poet—can do. He may be philosopher as well as poet—may have a thought, 
as profound a thought as you please, but if he do not express it so as 
to produce an emotion in an emotional mind he has not spoken as a poet 
speaks. It is the philosopher’s trade to make us think, the poet’s to 
make us feel. If he is so fortunate as to have his thought, well and 
good; he can make us feel, with it as well as without—and without it as 
well as with.</p>
<p>One would not care to give up the philosophy that underruns so much of Shakspeare’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
 work, but how little its occasional absence affects our delight is 
shown by the reading of such “nonsense verses” as the song in a “As You 
Like It,” beginning:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">It was a lover and his lass,</div>
<div class="i2">With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>One does not need the music; the lines sing themselves, and are full 
of the very spirit of poetry. What the dickens they may chance to mean 
is quite another matter. What is poetry, anyhow, but “glorious 
nonsense”? But how very glorious the nonsense happens to be! What 
“thought” did Ariel try to express in his songs in “The Tempest”? There 
is hardly the tenth part of a thought in them; yet who that has a 
rudimentary, or even a vestigial, susceptibility to sentiment and 
feeling, can read them without the thrill that is stubborn to the 
summoning of the profoundest reflections of Hamlet in his inkiest cloak?</p>
<p>Poetry may be conjoined with thought. In the great poets it commonly 
is—that is to say, we award the palm to him who is great in more than 
one direction. But the poetry is a thing apart from the thought and 
demanding a separate consideration. The two have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
 more essential connection than the temple and its granite, the statue 
and its bronze. Is the sculptor’s work less great in the clay than it 
becomes in the hands of the foundry man?</p>
<p>No one, not the greatest poet nor the dullest critic, knows what 
poetry is. No man, from Milton down to the acutest and most pernicious 
lexicographer, has been able to define its name. To catch that butterfly
 the critic’s net is not fine enough by much. Like electricity, it is 
felt, not known. If it could be known, if the secret were accessible to 
analysis, why, one could be taught to write poetry without having been 
“born unto singing.”</p>
<p>So it happens that the most penetrating criticism must leave 
eternally unsaid the thing that is most worth saying. We can say of a 
poem as of a picture, an Ionic column, or any work of art: “It is 
charming!” But why and how it charms—there we are dumb, its creator no 
less than another.</p>
<p>What is it in art before which all but the unconscious peasant and 
the impenitent critic confess the futility of speech? Why does a certain
 disposition of words affect us deeply when if differently arranged to 
mean the same thing they stir no emotion whatever? He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span> who can answer that has surprised the secret of the Sphinx, and after him shall be no more poetry forever!</p>
<p>Expound who is able the charm of these lines from “Kubla Khan:”</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">A damsel with a dulcimer</div>
<div class="i0">In a vision once I saw.</div>
<div class="i0">It was an Abyssinian maid,</div>
<div class="i0">And on her dulcimer she played,</div>
<div class="i0">Singing of Mount Abora.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is no “thought” here—nothing but the baldest narrative in 
common words arranged in their natural order; but upon whose 
heart-strings does not that maiden play?—and who does not adore her?</p>
<p>Like the entire poem of which they are a part, and like the entire 
product of which the poem is a part, the lines are all imagination and 
emotion. They address, not the intellect, but the heart. Let the analyst
 of poetry wrestle with them if he is eager to be thrown.</p>

<h3 id="THE_PASSING_OF_SATIRE">THE PASSING OF SATIRE</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“YOUNG man,” said the Melancholy Author, “I do not commonly permit myself to be ‘interviewed’; what paper do you represent?”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter spoke the name of the great journal that was connected with him.</p>
<p>“I never have heard of it,” said the Melancholy Author. “I trust that it is devoted to the interests of Literature.”</p>
<p>Assurance was given that it had a Poets’ Corner and that among its 
regular contributors it numbered both Aurora Angelina Aylmer and 
Plantagenet Binks, the satirist.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” said the great man, “you surprise me! I had supposed that 
satire, once so large and wholesome an element in English letters, was 
long dead and d—— pardon me—buried. You must bear with me if I do not 
concede the existence of Mr. Binks. Satire cannot co-exist with so 
foolish sentiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span> as ‘the
 brotherhood of man,’ ‘the trusteeship of wealth,’ moral 
irresponsibility, tolerance, Socialism and the rest of it. Who can ‘lash
 the rascals naked through the world’ in an age that holds crime to be a
 disease, and converts the prison into a sanitarium?”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter ventured to ask if he considered crime a 
symptom of mental health. By way of fortifying himself for a reply, the 
melancholy one visited the sideboard and toped a merciless quantity of 
something imperfectly known to his visitor from the arid South.</p>
<p>“Crime, sir,” said he, partly recovering, “is merely a high degree of
 selfishness directed by a low degree of intelligence. If selfishness is
 a disease none of us is altogether well. We are all selfish, or we 
should not be living, but most of us have the discernment to see that 
our permanent advantage does not lie in gratification of our malevolence
 by murder, nor in augmenting our possessions by theft. Those of us who 
think otherwise should be assisted to a saner view by punishment. It is 
sad, so sad, to reflect that many of us escape it.”</p>
<p>“But it is agreed,” said the journalist, “by all our illustrious sociologists—Brand Whitlock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
 Clarence Darrow, Eugene Debs and Emma Goldman—that punishment is 
useless, that it does not deter; and they prove it by the number of 
convictions recorded against individual criminals. Will you kindly say 
if they are right?”</p>
<p>“They know that punishment deters—not perfectly, for nothing is 
perfect, but it deters. If every human institution that lamentably fails
 to accomplish its full purpose is to be abolished none will remain.”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter begged to be considered worthy to know what, 
apart from its great wisdom and interest, all this had to do with 
satire.</p>
<p>“Satire,” said the Melancholy Author, “is punishment. As such it has 
fallen into public disfavor through disbelief in its justice and 
efficacy. So the rascals go unlashed. Instead of ridicule we have solemn
 reprobation; for wit we have ‘humor’—with a slang word in the first 
line, two in the second and three in the third. Why, sir, the American 
reading public hardly knows that there ever was a distinctive kind of 
writing known, technically, as satire—that it was once not only a glory 
to literature but, incidentally, a terror to all manner of civic and 
personal unworth. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span> we 
had to-day an Aristophanes, a Jonathan Swift or an Alexander Pope, he 
would indubitably be put into a comfortable prison with all sanitary 
advantages, fed upon yellow-legged pullets and ensainted by the Little 
Brothers of the Bad. For they would think him a thief. In the same 
error, the churches would pray for him and the women compete for his 
hand in marriage.”</p>
<p>The thought of so great a perversion of justice overcame the creator 
of the vision and he sank into a chair already occupied by the cat—a 
contested seat.</p>

<h3 id="SOME_DISADVANTAGES_OF_GENIUS">SOME DISADVANTAGES OF GENIUS</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“MY CHILD,” said the Melancholy Author, “the sharpest affliction besetting a man of genius is genius.”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter ventured to explain that he had been taught otherwise.</p>
<p>“In the first place,” continued the Melancholy Author, inattentive to
 dissent, “the man of genius cannot hope to be understood by his 
contemporaries. The more they concede his genius, the less will they 
comprehend any particular manifestation of it. Carlyle has said that the
 first impression of a work of genius is disagreeable. There are 
magazines and publishing houses that say they receive as many as 
twenty-five thousand manuscripts a year. Of course, as Dr. Holmes 
pointed out, one does not have to eat an entire cheese to know if he 
likes it—it is needless to read all manuscripts through to the bitter 
end. But how if in those that are really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> great the apparently bitter end is the beginning? If the first impression is disagreeable—to one who is <i>not</i> a genius, just an editor—what chance of acceptance has the work?”</p>
<p>Not daring to affirm his steadfast conviction that all editors are 
men of genius, the interviewer suffered in (and from) silence, and the 
great man went on:</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the work of a man of genius is necessarily different 
from that of all others; by that difference, indeed, it is 
credentialed—to posterity—as a work of genius. But the editor, or the 
publisher’s reader—will he feel sure of his ground when dealing with 
that to which he is unaccustomed?—of whose acceptability to the public 
he is without the <i>criteria</i> to judge? With an abiding though 
secret sense of his own fallibility, will he not think it expedient to 
take the safe side and reject the work? That will at least entail no 
possible ‘difference of opinion’ with his employer. Dead manuscripts 
tell no tales. Sir, in the noble profession of letters it is the rule, 
attested by a thousand familiar instances, that the man of genius is 
starved by those whose successors in the seats of authority pay enormous
 prices for any scrap of his work that may survive him. Consider the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
 case of Poe, of Lafcadio Hearn—who confessed that in the last dozen 
years of his life his average annual earnings by his pen did not exceed 
five hundred dollars. And I am no millionaire myself.”</p>
<p>As the Melancholy Author paused to celebrate his poverty at the 
sideboard his auditor cautiously advanced the view that several living 
writers of indubitable genius were pretty prosperous.</p>
<p>“Despite their genius,” said the great man, drying his lips with his 
coat-sleeve, “and because of something else. One of them may have the 
good fortune to take the attention of some distinguished person having 
the world’s ear at his tongue’s end, and the habit of loquacity—a person
 like Colonel Roosevelt, or the late Mr. Gladstone. Did not the latter, 
by a few words of commendation, provide for life for Mrs. Humphry Ward 
and for eternity for Marie Bashkirtseff? True, the one is impenitently 
dull and the other was a shrilling lunatic; but by accident he <i>might</i>
 have praised an author of consummate ability. Another really great 
writer may be prosperous—that is to say, popular—because of some 
engaging mannerism or artifice; as Mr. Kipling bends from his Olympian 
omniscience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span> to flatter his
 readers with colloquial familiarity. Another, like Dickens, may have 
the good luck to be an amusing vulgarian, or, like Mr. Riley, be willing
 to write lyrics of the pumpkin-field in the ‘dialect’ of those who eat 
pumpkins. It may happen, too, although in point of fact it never does 
happen, that a man of genius is at the little end of a long, brass 
trumpet—I mean, is editor of Our Leading Magazine. Even conceding your 
entire claim for these fortunate persons (which I do not) it is clear 
that their genius has had nothing to do with their success. You are a 
hebetudinous futilitarian!”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter “shrank to his second cause and was no more.” 
On reviving, he humbly submitted that he had affirmed nothing of the 
authors named, nor even mentioned them.</p>
<p>“Genius has been a thousand times defined,” resumed the oracle, 
regardless; “nevertheless we know fairly well what, partly, it is. <i>Inter alia</i>,
 it is the faculty of knowing things without having to learn them. When 
Hugo wrote his immortal narrative of Waterloo he had never seen a 
battle; nor was Dickens ever in solitary confinement in the Pennsylvania
 penitentiary. But will the possessor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
 of this miraculous faculty profit by it, or even be able rightly to use
 it in the service of another’s gain? No; in his dealings with his 
fellow men, editors and publishers included, he will find them unaware, 
and unable to perceive, that he knows any more than they do. He will 
encounter, indeed, the most insuperable distrust, even from those who 
concede his genius; for genius is almost universally held to be a 
particular kind of brilliant disability. The story of Homer instructing 
the sandal-maker how to make foot-gear is, of course, apocryphal, but no
 more credence is given to the authentic instance of Lord Brougham 
showing the brewer how to make beer. Even those who assent to the best 
definition of genius ever made—‘great general ability directed into a 
particular channel’—will unconsciously assume that it is confined to 
that channel, and will assist in keeping it there. Its most 
distinguishing feature—versatility—the power to do many kinds of work 
equally well—will get no contemporary recognition. Having a reputation 
for writing great stories (for example) you will write equally great 
essays, satires and what not, all in vain. It is only to mediocrity that
 ‘great general ability’ is conceded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
 That is why the late William Sharp, turning to another kind of work 
than that in which he had distinguished himself, took a feminine name, 
and, secure from disparaging comparison with himself, was accessible to 
commendation. As the work of William Sharp, that of ‘Fiona McLeod’ would
 have evoked a chorus of deprecation as evidence of failing power. In 
literature, a single specialty is all that contemporary criticism is 
willing to allow to genius. Posterity tells a juster tale, albeit 
disposed to go to the other extreme, seeing something of the fire divine
 in even the paste jewels wherewith the great lapidary pelted the wolf 
from his door.”</p>
<p>“Then you would advise the writer of distinction to stick to his—latest?”</p>
<p>“That will not save him. The criticism that will not concede 
versatility will deny stability. After a few years, the man of genius, 
however he may confine himself to the kind of work in which, despite its
 excellence, he has been successful, must face the inevitable and solemn
 judgment that he has ‘exhausted the vein,’ ‘fallen down,’ ‘gone stale.’
 It matters not if practice and years have ripened his imagination, 
broadened his knowledge and refined his taste—for great minds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
 do not decay with age; his contemporaries will have it that he is 
‘written out,’ for he is no longer a new thing under the sun.”</p>
<p>The Melancholy Author himself looks hardly more than seventy-five.</p>
<p>“‘Written out, written out’—England said so of Dickens and Tennyson; 
America said so of Bret Harte; both have for five years been saying so 
of Kipling. The great writer is likely, by the way, to share that view 
himself, as Thackeray, reading over some of his early work, exclaimed: 
‘What a giant I was in those days!’</p>
<p>“Another lion in the path of genius is its own success—the low kind 
of success that is called popularity, for which some sons of the gods, 
with their bellies sticking to their backs, really do strive. Let one of
 them achieve a result of this kind and he will find it all the harder 
to achieve another. Read Stockton’s story of ‘My Wife’s Deceased 
Sister.’ The narrator tells how, having published a popular tale with 
that title, he was ever thereafter what is called in the slang to which 
your detestable profession is addicted, ‘a dead one.’ Editors would take
 nothing that he offered, but always begged for something like ‘My 
Wife’s Deceased Sister.’ Sir, I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
 how it feels to go up against that invincible competitor, oneself. 
After publication of my famous story, ‘The Maiden Pirate,’ my greater 
(and even longer) work, ‘A Treatise on the Chaldean Dative Case,’ was 
rejected by twenty editors! Let the man of genius beware of popularity; 
one slip of that kind and a brilliant future is behind him. But it does 
not greatly matter, for even without incurring the mischance of a ‘hit,’
 the great writer is, as I said, foredoomed to the charge of 
degeneracy.”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter humbly murmured the names of Hall Caine, Henry 
James, the late F. Marion Crawford, Mrs. Mary Wilkins Freeman, Miss Mary
 Murfree, Miss Mary Edward Bok, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Ella Wheeler 
Sylvester Vierick, and the venerable Hildegarde Hawthorne—then edged 
himself softly toward an open door. With unforeseen resourcefulness, the
 sad-eyed deprecator of dissent seized a convenient missile, but it 
happened to be a decanter of Medford rum, and the situation was saved. 
With fortified solemnity the father of the maiden pirate again took up 
his parable:</p>
<p>“Certain literary domains are posted with warnings to the trespasser, and against men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
 of genius the inhibition is fiercely enforced. Irruptions of mediocrity
 entail no penalty because unobserved by the constabulary. The supposed 
proprietors of these guarded estates are long dead, leaving no heirs; 
the ‘notices’ are put up without authority, for the land is really a 
common. One of these closed areas is that of Jonathan Swift, who 
dispossessed some of the successors of Lucian. Whom Lucian dispossessed 
we do not know, all evidences of an earlier occupancy than his having 
been effaced by the burning of the great library at Alexandria. All, 
doubtless, incurred ‘the penalty of the law,’ each in his turn, from the
 dunces of his day. The ‘penalty’ is execration as an imitator. Long 
before Swift, and probably long before Lucian, an accepted method of 
satire was comparison of actual with imaginary civilizations, through 
tales of fictitious travelers in unreal regions. But since Swift, woe to
 the writer having the hardihood to adopt the method, however candidly 
avowed, and however different the manner! It is as if guardians of 
Homer’s fame had chased Dante and Camoëns out of the field of the epic, 
and had put up the bars against Milton. Nay, it is as if an engineer 
platting a survey were accused of imitating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
 Euclid. True, Virgil, who did imitate Homer most shamelessly, escapes 
censure. I fancy the Proponents-Militant of Originality have not heard 
of him.</p>
<p>“In our own day Bret Harte wrote charming sketches of life and 
character in Californian mining camps. Many others had done so before 
him, but for many years after his first work in that field none could 
enter it without incurring austere denunciation as imitator and 
plagiarist; and even to-day one having the experience to observe or the 
genius to imagine the life of a Californian mining camp, or any 
interesting feature of it, delivers his tidings, like the heralds of 
old, at his peril.</p>
<p>“Another of these posted preserves is that of satire in iambic 
pentameter verse. This mode of expression is supposed to belong by right
 divine to Alexander Pope, who made the most constant and cleverest use 
of it. With its concomitants of epigram and antithesis, it was old 
before Pope was young. He was himself a ‘trespasser’; he was roundly 
reviled for imitating Dryden. The form was used by other Queen Anne’s 
men, acceptably by Johnson and by many a later; but of this the 
patrolmen and gatekeepers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
 Pope reservation in our day have not been apprised by ‘report 
divine’—the only way that they can be made to know anything, for read, 
the devil a bit do they. In the literary landscape they see only the 
highest peaks of the Delectable Mountains. They know only the large, 
familiar figures, and these only by their most characteristic work. To 
their indurated understandings each individual of this bright band 
stands for a particular field of composition. His title to exclusive 
possession is <i>res adjudicata</i>. If anybody set foot across the 
sacred boundary—little fellows excepted—he will find himself the 
fundamental element in a cone of pummeling custodians. Young man, in 
your report of this interview you will be good enough to quote me as 
deprecating that situation.”</p>
<p>The interviewer pledged his life, his sacred fortune and his honor to the performance of that duty, and the great man resumed:</p>
<p>“Of all these inhibiting <i>censores literarum</i>, the most austere and implacable are those guarding the sovereignty of Poe. They have made his area of activity a veritable <i>mare clausum</i>—as if he were</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i3">the first that ever burst</div>
<div class="i0">Into that silent sea.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter signified his sense of the speaker’s fertility 
of metaphor: there had been an inundation (of words) and the “estate” 
had become a “sea.” He whistled softly “A Life on the Ocean Wave.”</p>
<p>“It was not an unknown sea; it was cris-crossed by the wakes of a 
thousand ships and charted to the last reef. Tales of the tragic and the
 supernatural are the earliest utterances in every literature. When the 
savage begins to talk he begins to tell wonder tales of death and 
mystery—of terror and the occult. Tapping, as they do, two of the three 
great mother-lodes of human interest, these tales are a constant 
phenomenon—the most permanent, because the most fascinating, element in 
letters. Great Scott! has the patrol never heard of <i>The Thousand and One Nights</i>, of <i>The Three Spaniards</i>, of Horace Walpole, of ‘Monk’ Lewis, of De Quincey, of Maturin, Ingemann, Blicher, Balzac, Hoffmann, Fitz James O’Brien?”</p>
<p>The reporter summoned the boldness to say that the charge of 
imitation had not been made against De Maupassant, who certainly was not
 an unobserved “little fellow,” and was contemporary with the offending 
critics.</p>
<p>“Why, sir,” said the Melancholy Author,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span> “you forget—he wrote in French. Translations? Dear me, have there been translations? How sad!</p>
<p>“As to ‘originality’ that is merely a matter of manner. The ancients 
exhausted the possibilities of method. In respect of that, one cannot 
hope to do much that is both new and worth doing, but there are as many 
styles—that is, ways of doing—as writers. One can no more help having 
some individuality in manner than one can help looking somewhat 
different from anybody else, although hopeless of being much of a giant,
 or unique as to number and distribution of arms, legs and head. But, 
sir, this demand for ‘originality’ is a call for third-rate men, who 
alone supply such a semblance of it as is still possible. The writer of 
sane understanding and wholesome ambition is content to meet his great 
predecessors on their own ground. He enters the public stadium, and 
although perversely handicapped because of his no record and mocked by 
the <i>claque</i>; and although the spectators are sure to declare him 
beaten, that ultimate umpire, Posterity, will figure the matter out, and
 may announce a different result.”</p>
<p>The reporter has reason to think that much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
 more was said, but he had the misfortune to fall asleep; and when 
wakened by the sound of a closing door he was alone. “My!” he said; “I 
have had a narrow escape; if the man that once proclaimed me a genius 
had not happened to be a fool I know not what evils might have befallen 
me.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“NO,” said the Melancholy Author, “I do not 
understand British criticism of American attempts at spelling reform. 
The claim of our insular cousins to a special ownership and particular 
custody of our language is impudent. English is not a benefaction that 
we owe to living Englishmen, nor a loan to be enjoyed, under conditions 
prescribed by the creditors. When our ancestors ‘came over’ they did not
 sign away any rights of revision of their own speech; and if a man come
 not honestly by his mother-tongue I know not what he may be said 
legitimately to own. I am not addicted to intemperate words, and harsh 
retaliation does not engage my assent, but when I see an Englishman 
reaching ‘hands across the sea’ to punish what he chooses to call an 
infraction of the laws of <i>his</i> language, I am tempted to slap his wrist.”</p>
<p>In the presence of this portentous incarnation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span> of justice the Timorous Reporter trembled appropriately and was silent in all the dialects of his native land and Kansas.</p>
<p>“What would they have,” continued the great, sad man—“these 
‘conservatives’? A language immune to change? That would be a dead 
language and we should have to evolve a successor. Ours has never been a
 changeless tongue; nothing is more mutable, even in its orthography. As
 it existed a few centuries ago it is now unintelligible except to a few
 specialists, yet every change has encountered as fierce hostility as 
any that is now proposed. Compare a page of ‘Beowulf’ with a page of the
 London <i>Times</i> or <i>The Spectator</i> and see what incalculable 
quantities of ‘crow’ the luckless ‘guardians of our noble tongue’ have 
had to swallow. Do you wonder, young man, that they are a dyspeptic 
folk? And did not Dr. Samuel Johnson formulate a great truth in the 
dictum that ‘every sick man is a scoundrel’?”</p>
<p>“Surely,” ventured the Timorous Reporter, “you would not apply so 
harsh a word to the great English reviewers, nor to our own beloved 
Professor Harry Thurston Peck!”</p>
<p>“To be consistent these gentlemen should not demand that the spelling remain as it is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
 for its present condition is the result of innumerable defeats of 
themselves and their predecessors by hardy ‘corruptors.’ It is 
pusillanimous of them not only to accept a situation that has been 
forced upon them but to proclaim it sacred and fight for its eternal 
maintenance. They should be making heroic efforts to restore at least 
the spelling of Hakluyt and Sir John Mandeville. It is not so very long 
since a few timid innovators began (as secretly as the nature of the 
rebellious act would permit) to leave off the ‘k’ in such words as 
‘musick’ ‘publick’ and so forth. Instantly</p>

<div class="i0">The wonted roar was up amid the woods,</div>

</div>
</div>
<p class="noindent">the self-appointed ‘guardians of our noble tongue’ 
rose as one old lady and swore that rather than submit they would run 
away! That sacred ‘k’ is no more, but they are with us yet, untaught by 
failure and unstilled by shame. It is the nature of a fool to hate a 
thing when it is new, adore it when it is current, and despise it when 
it is obsolete.”</p>
<p>Pleased with his epigram, the Melancholy Author so accentuated the sadness of his countenance as to invite a sincere compassion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>
<p>“We hear much from the scholar-folk about the importance of 
preserving the derivation of words, not only as a guide to their 
meaning, but because from the genealogy and biography of words we get 
instructive side-lights on the history and customs of nations. That is 
all true: philology is a useful and fascinating study. Read <i>The Queen’s English</i> of the late Dean Alford if you think it is not. (Incidentally, I may mention my own humble volumes on <i>The Genesis and Evolution of ‘Puss’ as the Vocative Form of ‘Cat.’</i>)
 But derivation is really not a very sure guide to signification. For 
example, what do I learn of the meaning of ‘desultory’ by knowing that 
it is from the Latin ‘desultor,’ a circus performer that leaps from 
horse to horse? In many instances the origin of a word is misleading, as
 in ‘miscreant,’ which, etymologically, means nothing worse than 
‘unbeliever.’ Of course it is interesting to hear in it a lingering echo
 of an ecclesiastic damning in a time when nothing worse than an 
unbeliever was thought to exist.</p>
<p>“But, as the late Prof. Schele de Vere pointed out, the roots of 
words are better disclosed in their sound than in their spelling. By 
phonetic spelling only can their pronunciation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> be made nearly uniform—if that is an advantage. If this is not obvious, human intelligence is a shut clam.”</p>
<p>The creator of this beautiful figure celebrated it at the sideboard and resumed his illuminating discourse.</p>
<p>“To those who deem it worth while to be happy, the study of 
derivations is, indeed, a perpetual banquet of delights, but it is 
important to remember that language is not merely, nor chiefly, a 
plaything for scholars, but a thing of utility in the conduct of life 
and affairs. To its service in that character all obstruent 
considerations should, and eventually do, give way. It may please, and 
to some extent profit, to know that ‘phthisis’ comes from the Greek 
‘phthio’—to waste away—but if in order that one may see this, as well as
 hear it, I must so spell it as to deny to certain letters of the 
alphabet their customary and established powers I protest against the 
desecration. Our orthography has no greater sanctity than have the 
vested rights of the vowels and consonants by which we achieve it. Why 
do not ‘the whiskered pandours and the fierce hussars’ of conservatism 
stand forth as champions of that noble Roman, the English alphabet?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>
<p>“Yes, I concede the importance of being able to trace the origin of 
words, for words are thoughts, and their history is a record of 
intellectual progress, but in very few of them would a simplified, even a
 consistently phonetic, spelling tend to obscure the trail by which they
 came into the language. And as to these few, why not learn their origin
 from the dictionaries once for all and have done with it? The labor 
would be incomparably less than that of learning to spell as we do.”</p>
<p>Impressed but not silenced, the thirsty soul at the fountain of 
wisdom cautiously advanced the view that the reformed spelling is 
uncouth to the eye.</p>
<p>“It is most dispiriting,” said the oracle, in the low, sad tones that
 served to distinguish him from the bagpipes of Skibo castle, “to hear 
from the beardless lips of youth a folly so appropriate to age and 
experience. To the unobservant, any change in the familiar looks 
disagreeable. The newest fashion in silk hats looks ridiculous; a little
 later the old style looks worse. To me nothing is uncouth: the most 
refined and elevated sentiment loses nothing by its expression in as 
nearly phonetic spelling as our inadequate alphabet will permit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span> For my reading you may spell like Josh Billings if you will not write like him.”</p>
<p>“From all that you have been kind enough to say,” said the Timorous 
Reporter, with a sudden access of courage that alarmed him, “I infer 
that in your forthcoming great work, <i>The Tyrant Preposition</i>, you will employ the Skibonese philanthropography.”</p>
<p>“Not I. Courage is an excellent thing in man: the soldier is useful; 
but each to his trade. Mine, sir,” he concluded, with a note of pride 
underrunning the grave, sweet monotony of his discourse, “is writing.”</p>

<h3 id="THE_AUTHOR_AS_AN_OPPORTUNITY">THE AUTHOR AS AN OPPORTUNITY</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“TO the literary man,” said the Melancholy Author, 
“life is not all ‘beer and skittles’ by much. He is in a peculiar sense 
the custodian of ‘troubles of his own.’ Of these, one of the most 
insupportable grows out of the fact that almost every man, woman or 
child thinks himself, herself or itself an expert in literature, and the
 literary man a Heaven-sent Opportunity. No hawk ever watched a plump 
pullet detaching itself from the flock, with a more possessing delight 
than burns in the bosom of the average human being when a defenceless 
author ‘swims into his ken.’ Lord, Lord, with what alacrity he swoops 
down upon the incautious wight and holds him with his glittering eye to 
‘talk books’ at him!</p>
<p>“He knows it all, the good assailant—knows all about books, particularly ‘the English classics’ and the newest novel. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
 knowledge—consisting, at the best, in whatever is current in popular 
criticism of the newspaper and magazine sort—he has quite persuaded 
himself is knowledge of Literature. It never occurs to the good creature
 that books are not literature; that he might have read every book in 
the world yet know no more of literature than a horned toad. Naturally, 
you do not care to explain to him that literature is an art—the art of 
which books are merely a result. He sees the result, but of the art 
behind them he knows not even so much as its existence.</p>
<p>“He thinks that good writing is done as naturally, instinctively and 
with as little training as a bird sings in a tree, or a pig in a gate. 
He would be willing to admit that good painting cannot be done, good 
music executed, a good plea made in court, or good medical attendance 
given to the sick, without a deal of hard study of principles and 
methods. But writing—why, writing is merely setting down what you think;
 everybody writes.</p>
<p>“Even the literary critic—may hornets afflict him!—cannot be 
intelligently objectionable without a technical knowledge of his 
business. A great poet has said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">A man must serve his time at every trade,</div>
<div class="i0">Save censure; critics all are ready made.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>“And ‘censure’ here, you will have the goodness to observe, means not
 condemnation, as in our common speech, but the passing of judgment of 
any kind on the work of another.</p>
<p>“Suppose you were a famous electrician, and all other persons, eager 
to show you that they, too, know a thing or two and solemnly persuaded 
of the necessity of regaling you with scraps from your own table, should
 gravely define electricity as a ‘mysterious force,’ express to you the 
belief that it is destined to ‘revolutionize the world’ and declare 
their admiration of Benjamin Franklin’s gigantic achievement in drawing 
it from a cloud. Suppose you could turn away from one tormentor only to 
fall into the hands of another and another, all uttering the same 
infantile babble—the same shallow platitudes, the same false judgment. 
That would be no more than we authors have to endure, and smile in the 
endurance. Nay, not so much, for not only do we have to suffer all this 
talk of the ‘shop’—our shop—with all its irritating idiocy, but if we 
open our mouths to say something worth while, God help us!—we’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
 a ‘fight’ on hand forthwith. For it is of the nature of ignorance to be
 disputatious, contentious, cantankerous. The more a man does not know, 
the more aggressive his manner of not knowing it. Venture to rack one of
 his ugly literary idols by so much as the breadth of a finger and—!”</p>
<p>Unable to suppress his emotion, the Melancholy Author rose and strode
 three paces toward an open door, then turned and, striding back again, 
dropped into his seat and tried to look unconcerned.</p>
<p>“The very persons who seek your society because they honestly admire 
your intellect will resent every manifestation of it. Whatever they do 
not understand, whatever is unfamiliar to them, is bad—false and immoral
 and insincere. Why, I remember a woman who came four hundred miles to 
see me—to sit at my feet, she was kind enough to say, and partake of my 
wisdom. In less than ten minutes she was angrily affirming the unworth 
of my opinions and attempting to inoculate me with her own. What did I 
do? My friend, what could I do, but wait until the storm had subsided 
and then express my admiration of the pink bow that she wore at her 
throat. Alas, I had sailed into a zone of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span> storms, for it was cherry, and away went she!</p>
<p>“Now, I am willing to talk of literature—it is one of the delights of
 my life to do so. I am even willing to ‘talk books.’ But it must be 
with my equals, or with those who show some sense of the fact that a 
lifetime passed in the study of my art, and in its practice counts for 
something. Few things are more agreeable than imparting knowledge to 
those who in good faith and decent humility seek it; and such there are.
 I know some of them, and in their service find enough to do to keep me 
awake nearly all day. But the other sort: readers of brand-new books and
 reviews thereof; persons who think the ancients were barbarians; 
philosophers by birth and critics by inspiration who know it all without
 having learned any part of it—may Heaven,” concluded the Melancholy 
Author, with a fine flourish of his right hand, “bestow them as friends 
upon my enemies.”</p>

<h3 id="ON_POSTHUMOUS_RENOWN">ON POSTHUMOUS RENOWN</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“NO,” said the Melancholy Author, “I do not expect 
my name to be shouted in brass on the frieze of Miss Helen Gould’s 
‘Temple of Fame.’”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter ventured to inquire if that was because he had the misfortune to be alive.</p>
<p>“That is a disqualification that time will remove,” answered the 
Melancholy Author. “The ground of my hope is different: I shall cause to
 be inscribed upon my tombstone the lines following:</p>
<div class="center-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Good friends, for Jesus’ sake forbear</div>
<div class="i0">To grieve the soul that’s gone to—where?</div>
<div class="i0">Blest be the man that spares my fame,</div>
<div class="i0">And curst be he that flaunts my name!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>“The lines are admirable and extremely original,” said the Timorous 
Reporter. “May I ask if your reluctance to have your name emblazoned in 
the Temple is due to disesteem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span> of the methods and results of selection, or to that innate modesty which serves to distinguish you from the violet?”</p>
<p>“To neither. It is due to my consciousness of the futility of all 
attempts to perpetuate an individual fame. When I die my fame will die 
with me. It is mine no longer than I live to bear it. When there is no 
nominative there can be no possessive.</p>
<p>“For illustration, you speak of Shakspeare’s fame. But there is no 
Shakspeare. The fame that you speak of is not ‘his’; it is ours—yours, 
mine and John Smith’s. To call it ‘his’—why, sir, that is as if one 
should concede the ownership of property to a vacuum. The dead are 
poor—they have nothing. Our mental confusion in this matter is no doubt 
largely due to our imperfect grammar: we have not enough cases in our 
declension; or, rather, there are not enough names for the cases that we
 have. In the phrase ‘a horse’s tail’ we say rightly that ‘horse’s’ is 
in the possessive case: the animal really possesses—owns—the tail. But 
in the phrase ‘a horse’s price’ there is no possessive, for the horse 
does not own the price: there should be another name for the case. When 
dead, the horse does not own even the tail. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
 the same with ‘Shakspeare’s fame’: while he lived the phrase contained a
 possessive case; now it is something different—merely what the Latin 
calls a genitive. Our name for it misleads the unenlightened and makes 
them think of a dead man as owning things. One of my ambitions, I may 
add, is to bring English grammar into conformity with fact, promoting 
thereby every moral, intellectual and material interest of the race!”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter summoned the courage to rouse him from ecstatic
 contemplation of the glory of his great reform by directing his 
disobedient attention to the fact that the Latin grammar, also, is 
defective, in that its genitive case is not supplemented by a 
possessive; yet the Romans appear to have had a pretty definite 
conception of “mine” and “thine,” albeit the latter was less lucidly 
apprehended than the former, and held a humbler place in the national 
conscience. Deigning to ignore the argument, the Melancholy Author 
resumed his discourse:</p>
<p>“Posthumous fame being what it is—if nothing can be said to be 
something—the desire to attain it is comic. It seems the invention of a 
humorist, this ambition to attach to your name (and equally to that of 
every person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span> bearing it, 
or to bear it hereafter) something that you will not know that you have 
attached to it. You labor for a result which you are to be forever 
unaware that you have brought about—for a personal gratification which 
you know that you are eternally forbidden to enjoy: if the gods ever 
laugh, do they not laugh at that?”</p>
<p>To signify his sense of the humor of the situation, the Melancholy 
Author fashioned the visage of him to so poignant a degree of visible 
dejection as might have affected an open tomb with envy and despair.</p>
<p>“Some time,” he continued, “the earth, her spinning retarded by the 
sun’s tidal action, will turn on her axis only once a year, presenting 
always the same side to the sun, as Venus does now, and as the moon does
 to the earth. That side will be unthinkably hot; the other, dark and 
unthinkably cold. Of man and his works nothing will remain. Later, the 
sun’s light and fire exhausted, he and all his attendant planets and 
their satellites will whirl, as dead invisible bulks, through the black 
reaches of space to some inconceivable doom. Suppose that then a man who
 died to-day—or yesterday in Assyria—should be miraculously revived. He 
would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span> think that he had 
waked from a sleep of an instant’s duration. What to him would seem to 
have been the advantage of what he once knew as ‘fame’—sometimes as 
‘immortality’? Would he not smile to learn that his name had once evoked
 sentiments of admiration and respect—that it had been carved in stone 
or cast in metal to adorn a Temple of Fame? And when again, and finally,
 put to death for nothing, would not his last squeak and gurgle carry an
 aborted jest?</p>
<p>“My boy,” continued the Melancholy Author, suffering a look of 
compassion to defile the dread solemnity of his aspect, “I perceive that
 I have put the matter too strongly for you. You are not at home in the 
fields of space; you are disconcerted by the dirge of the spheres. Let 
us get back to earth as we have the happiness to know it. I will read 
you the concluding lines of a poem by an obscure pessimist, on the 
brevity of time and the futility of memorial structures:</p>
<div class="center-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Delighted with his ruse of binding an unresisting auditor by passing 
off his own poetry as that of another, the Melancholy Author fell into a
 sea-green stupor, and the Timorous Reporter, edging himself quietly 
through the door of opportunity, departed that life.</p>

<h3 id="THE_CRIME_OF_INATTENTION">THE CRIME OF INATTENTION</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“WHEN the germ of egotism is discovered,” said the 
Curmudgeon Philosopher, “it will be readily recognized. The cholera germ
 is sometimes called the ‘comma bacillus,’ from its resemblance to the 
printer’s comma; the bacillus of egotism does not look like a capital I,
 as you would naturally suppose, but like the note of admiration. In 
order to discover it you have only to shed the gore of the first man you
 meet (who is sure to be a bore and deserve it) and put a drop under the
 microscope. True, you may have defective eyesight from long 
contemplation of your dazzling self, and so miss it, but it is there as 
plain as the nose on an elephant’s face.”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter ventured to suggest that when the note of 
admiration was named, to admire meant, not to esteem, but to wonder—that
 Milton so uses it in relating the meeting of Satan and Death at the 
gates of Hell. There was no reason, he said, why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span> the germ of egotism or self-esteem should have the shape of that point.</p>
<p>“Having discovered and isolated the germ of egotism,” continued the 
Curmudgeon Philosopher, apparently addressing some exalted intelligence 
behind the Timorous Reporter, “the physicians will naturally cast about 
for a serum that will be powerful enough to beat it.”</p>
<p>The Curmudgeon Philosopher had the condescension to darken his environment with a smile.</p>
<p>“I should suppose that this might be made from the blood of a whale, a
 rhinoceros, a tiger and an anaconda, all, of course, duly inoculated 
with the germ till silly. If a few gallons of this mighty medicament 
were injected into the veins of a patient not more than two years of age
 it might so check his self-esteem that on growing up he would emblazon 
the violet on his coat of arms.”</p>
<p>The Curmudgeon Philosopher manifested his sense of his own 
distinction as a wit by a gesture singularly and appropriately 
elephantine. He had the goodness to continue: “A few years ago, before a
 just appreciation of the dignity of my position as a philosopher had 
compelled my withdrawal from the clubs and taverns, I used to observe 
that of a half-dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span> men 
sitting about a table and engaged in the characteristic industry of 
smoking and drinking, four were commonly talking of themselves, one, 
with an impediment in his enterprise, was endeavoring to ‘get the floor’
 in order to talk about <i>him</i>self, and the other (I trust it is needless to name him) was vainly asking attention to matters of interest and importance.</p>
<p>“It was customary among these gentlemen to interrupt one another in 
the middle of a sentence by ordering drinks or entering into a colloquy 
with the waiter, or addressing a trivial question to another of the 
party. Habitually the person speaking had the mortification to see his 
interlocutor turn squarely away from him and himself begin a monologue, 
only to be disregarded in his turn. There is something singularly 
pathetic in the spectacle of a man with an unfinished discourse turning 
to the only one of the party that has the civility to hear him out. It 
is one of the minor tragedies of social life, demanding an infinite 
compassion. Sometimes the sufferer would signify a just resentment by 
abruptly rising and leaving the table, but the rebuke was never even 
observed.</p>
<p>“Not the monologist alone was ignored in this unmannerly way; the nimble epigrammatist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
 fared no better. The brightest sallies of wit, the oddest ventures in 
paradox, the most delicious bits of humor and the finest turns of 
wisdom—all met the same fate, all alike fell upon the stony soil of 
inattention. Remember that I speak, not of ordinary dullards, but of the
 so-called choice spirits of clubland, ‘gentlemen of wit and pleasure 
about town.’”</p>
<p>With a sidewise movement toward the door the Timorous Reporter 
cautiously advanced the notion that possibly something in the quality of
 the Curmudgeon Philosopher’s wit may not have had the good fortune to 
commend itself to his auditors.</p>
<p>“Selected from Apuleius, from Rabelais, Pascal, Rochefoucauld, Pope, 
and boldly worked into the conversation, they always passed without 
recognition of either their source or their wit. The company was simply 
unaware that anything out of the common had been said. Egotism has a 
bale of cotton in each ear.”</p>
<p>The Curmudgeon Philosopher paused to note the effect of his epigram. 
Seeing that safety meant either applause or absence the Timorous 
Reporter deemed it expedient to withdraw by way of an open window.</p>

<h3 id="FETISHISM">FETISHISM</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“WE are wiser in many ways than our savage 
ancestors; we are wiser than the savages of to-day,” said the Curmudgeon
 Philosopher, with the air of one making a great concession; “yet for 
every folly or vice of uncivilized man I can show you a corresponding 
one among ourselves. In the matter of religions, for example, and of 
religious rites and observances, we have, mixed in with our better 
faiths, vestiges of all the primitive superstitions that have marked the
 childhood of the race. Vestiges, did I say? Why, sir, in many instances
 we have the veritable thing itself in all the vigor of its perennial 
prime.”</p>
<p>The Reporter ventured to express a conviction that a crude and 
primitive religion could have no devotees among so enlightened and 
cultivated a people as ours.</p>
<p>“Sir,” thundered the Adversary of Presumption, turning a delicate purple, “races<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
 are like individuals; along with the vices and virtues of maturity they
 have those of infancy. No people ever is sufficiently civilized and 
enlightened to have laid aside any of its early superstitions and 
absurdities. To these it adds better things. It overwrites its primitive
 ideas with ideas less crude and reasonless; but nothing has been 
effaced. The latest text of the palimpsest is most in evidence, but all 
is there and, to a keen enough observation, legible. Did you never see a
 whole concourse of moderns uncover to a flag?”</p>
<p>The Reporter confessed that those whom he had seen performing this religious rite were mostly moderns.</p>
<p>“They will say when detected,” continued the oracle, “that what they 
uncover to is not the flag, but the sentiment that it represents. If 
ingenious enough, the idolater would make the same defence. So would the
 shagpated chap that prostrates himself before the sacred moogoo tree.</p>
<p>“What’s that—a flag is a symbol? Why, yes, ‘symbol’ is the name we 
choose to give to objects which we know to have no real sanctity, yet, 
either from hereditary instinct or other unreasoning impulse, cannot 
forbear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span> to revere. The 
word is also used to denote a mere ‘survival,’ an object that once had a
 useful purpose, but now exists only because of our habit of having it. 
Be pleased to look down into that burial place.”</p>
<p>The Curmudgeon Philosopher’s dwelling had characteristically been chosen because of its contiguity to a cemetery.</p>
<p>“Note the number of ‘dummy’ urns surmounting the monuments. Centuries
 ago, when cremation was the rule, as it seems likely to be again, those
 would have been true urns, holding ashes of the dead. We have inherited
 the tendency to have them, but as they have now no utility we spare 
ourselves the trouble of accounting for them by saying they are 
symbolic—whereby the fashion is exalted to a high dignity.</p>
<p>“I assume your familiarity with the word ‘fetish.’ It is spelled two 
ways and pronounced four; I pronounce it as I was taught at my mother’s 
knee.”</p>
<p>By way of accentuating the fact that he had had a mother he affected a
 rudimentary tenderness of tone and expression which in a case of 
doubtful identity would have assisted in distinguishing him as a pirate 
of the Spanish Main.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>
<p>The Reporter asked what fetish worship might have the hardihood to be.</p>
<p>“Fetish worship,” replied the Curmudgeon Philosopher, “is the most 
primitive of religions. It is the form that belief in the supernatural 
takes in our lowest stage of intellectual development—the adoration of 
material objects. A stone or a tree supposed to possess supernatural 
powers of good or evil, or to have some peculiar sanctity, is a fetish. 
Idolatry and the worship of living things are not uncommonly confounded 
with fetish worship, but in reality are another and higher form of 
religion, belonging to a more advanced culture.”</p>
<p>“You have seen the proposal to transport Plymouth Rock about the 
country for a show? It is in the morning papers, one of which I had the 
bad luck to pick up while at breakfast. Hate the morning papers!”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter signified his regret.</p>
<p>“I hope it will not be done,” continued the Curmudgeon Philosopher, 
ignoring the apology. “In the first place, the Rock is devoid of 
authenticity. It is indubitably a rock, and it is at Plymouth, but its 
connection with the landing of the Pilgrims was supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
 by imagination. That is all right; by imagination we demonstrate our 
superiority to the novelists. Historians and scientists are credentialed
 by imagination; through imagination the philosopher attains to a 
knowledge of the meaning and message of things. Without imagination we 
should be as the magazine poets that perish.”</p>
<p>With obvious satisfaction in his character of cynic the Curmudgeon 
Philosopher again mitigated the austerity of his countenance—this time 
by something that may have been honestly intended as a smile.</p>
<p>“We have seen bands of children taught to march about a cracked bell,
 throw flowers upon it, sing hymns to it. When it stopped in the several
 cities that it was carried through on a triumphal car the populace 
turned out to worship it. It was supplied with a ‘guard of honor.’ Bands
 played appropriate music before it, and mayors ‘delivered eulogies.’ No
 popular hero or august sovereign could be accorded a more obsequious 
homage than this lifeless piece of cracked metal—nay, its progress is 
more like that of a Grecian god. This was fetishism, pure and undefiled.</p>
<p>“If this new project is carried out the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span> that worshiped a bell will worship a stone. True, the stone weighs several tons.”</p>
<p>Proud of his generosity in making so great a concession, the 
Curmudgeon Philosopher looked over the top of his spectacles for the 
applause that came not to his hope.</p>
<p>“Sir,” he concluded, his great fist falling like a thunderbolt upon the table at which he stood, “we are Pottawattomies!”</p>

<h3 id="OUR_AUDIBLE_SISTERS">OUR AUDIBLE SISTERS</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“NO,” said the Curmudgeon Philosopher, “I am no 
believer in ‘the elevating influence of woman.’ We have had women a long
 time, now; the influence is obvious, but the elevation—we are still 
waiting for that. Perhaps it was different in the old days when they had
 no connection with public affairs and could devote their entire 
attention to the business of giving men ‘a leg up,’ but to-day they are 
so busy assisting us to conduct the world’s large activities that they 
overlook our dissatisfaction with the low moral plane that we occupy.</p>
<p>“I think, sir, that old Sir William Devereux was wrong when he said 
that the best way to keep the dear creatures from playing the devil was 
to encourage them in playing the fool. We have been for more than a 
generation encouraging them to play the fool in a thousand and fifty 
ways, and they play the devil as never before.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>
<p>“These dreadful creatures—I mean these dear, delightful darlings—care
 for nothing but abstract ideas having no practical application to 
actual conditions in a faulty world. In the councils of Them Loud nobody
 cares for anything but principles and Principle. Every Mere Male who 
anywhere ventures to lift up his voice in behalf of an imperfect but 
practicable reform is outfitted by them with a set of motives that would
 disgrace a pirate. To the she colonels of uplift, nothing is so 
fascinating as Abstract Reform; they roll it as a sweet morsel under and
 over their tireless tongues. At every session of Congress you shall 
hear again the clank of the female saber in the corridors and committee 
rooms of the Capitol, intimidating the poltroon law maker. You shall 
hear the war whoop of the Sexless Impracticables, acclaiming the 
Sufficient Abstraction and denouncing the coarse expedients of the 
Erring Male. May the devil shepherd them in a barren place!”</p>
<p>Overcome by his emotions, the Curmudgeon Philosopher cruelly kicked 
the house dog (which “answered not with a caress”), and snorted at 
vacancy.</p>
<p>“What good does it all do, anyhow—this irruption of women into the domain of public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
 affairs? The advantages that Lively Woman promised even herself in 
becoming New and Audible are illusory; those that she renounced were 
real. For one thing, we no longer love her. Why, sir, I remember the 
time when I myself would have taken trouble to serve and honor women. I 
may say that I felt for them a special esteem. How is it to-day? They 
pass me by as the idle wind, unobserved, and—most significant of 
all—unobserving.</p>
<p>“Love, sir, ‘romantic love,’ as Tolstoi calls it, is a purely 
artificial thing. Many nations know it not. The ancient Greeks knew it 
not; the Japanese of yesterday did not at all comprehend it. There have 
been no other really civilized nations. We love those who are helpless 
and dependent on us. That is why we love our children and our pets.</p>
<p>“In demanding equal rights before the law woman renounces her claim 
to exceptional tenderness; in granting the demand, man accepts the 
renunciation in good faith. If the rest of you are going to look out for
 my wife, sir, I am left free to look out for myself. Have I really a 
wife? God forbid—I’m supposing one.</p>
<p>“When in the history of our civilization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
 was romantic love at high noon? Why, sir, ‘when knighthood was in 
flower’; when woman was a chattel; when a gentleman could divorce 
himself with a word. It was then that woman was set upon a pedestal and 
adored. Men consecrated their lives to the service of the sex—fought for
 woman, sang of her with a sincerity that is sadly lacking in the 
imitation troubadours of our time. Why, sir, even I, in my youth, 
composed some verses.”</p>
<p>The Curmudgeon Philosopher educed a manuscript from his breast-pocket
 and the Timorous Reporter began to withdraw from the Presence.</p>
<p>“O, very well—I’ll not force them on you; but permit me to remark, 
sir, that the decay of courtesy toward women is not unattended with a 
certain growing coarseness of manners in general. Those who have caught 
the base infection are not gentlemen, and you may go to the devil!”</p>

<h3 id="THE_NEW_PENOLOGY">THE NEW PENOLOGY</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“TRUE science,” said the Curmudgeon Philosopher, “began with publication, in 1620, of Lord St. Albans’ <i>Novum Organum</i>.
 Why not Lord Bacon’s? Because, my benighted friend, there was no ‘Lord 
Bacon.’ He was Francis Bacon, Baron Verulam, and, later, Viscount St. 
Albans. When you hear a man speak of ‘Lord Bacon’ fly from that man.</p>
<p>“The <i>Novum Organum</i>, or new method, has overthrown the <i>Organum</i>
 of Aristotle and released men’s minds from thraldom to the belief that 
truth could be got by mere reasoning, unaided by observation and 
experiment. This faith in the all-sufficiency of Logic had persisted for
 more than two thousand years, an intellectual paralysis invulnerable to
 treatment; and all the while the world thought itself enjoying robust 
mental health.</p>
<p>“Belief in the sufficiency of Deduction was not the only delusion that dominated and shackled the human mind, and some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span> others are with us to-day, to comfort and inspire! We think that if we did not have them we should be sick.”</p>
<p>Pleased with his wit, the Curmudgeon Philosopher executed the great convulsion of nature which he knew as a smile.</p>
<p>“One of the most mischievous of these false and futile faiths is 
known as the Reformation of Criminals. With no result, we have been 
embracing it with a devout fervor since the dawning of time. Our mistake
 is not so much that we have neglected to get the consent of the 
criminals as that we think ourselves able to reform them without it.</p>
<p>“Each habitual criminal is the hither end of an interminable line of 
criminal ancestors. He can reform no more than he can fly: his character
 is as immutable as the shape of his head or the texture of the muscle 
that he calls his heart. Our efforts in his behalf recall the story of 
the physician who, after examining a patient afflicted with a disorder 
of the skin, said: ‘This is hereditary; we must begin at the beginning. 
Go home and tell your father to take a sulphur bath.’ Our criminals are 
in worse case than that patient; he had an accessible father for the 
treatment.</p>
<p>“What have I to propose? What is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span> ‘New Method’ that I favor? What would I substitute for ‘reformation’ of the unworthy? Their destruction—I would kill them.”</p>
<p>With obvious pride in this humane suggestion, he stroked his ragged 
beard with both hands and adored his reflection in the mirror opposite 
his pedestal.</p>
<p>“It sounds harsh, I dare say, to one unfamiliar with the thought, and
 I might have said ‘remove’ if that would seem less alarming; but ‘kill’
 is an honest word, and I’ll stand to it.</p>
<p>“Think of it! The New Method would give us in two generations a 
nation without habitual criminals! What other will do that? Think of the
 lessened misery, the security of life and property, the lighter burden 
of taxation to maintain the machinery of justice, the no police—all that
 the besotted proponents of ‘Reformation’ hope and hope again and hope 
in vain to accomplish brought about in the lifetime of one man!</p>
<p>“And by means that are merciful to the criminals themselves. Can 
there be a doubt that if in him the love of life were not the mere brute
 instinct of a perverted soul the habitual criminal would prefer death? 
What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span> does life hold that 
is worth anything to such as he, devoid of self-respect and the respect 
of others, victim alike of justice and injustice, denied the delights 
that come of refined sensibilities, hunted from pillar to post and ever 
cowering in fear of the law? Nothing is more cruel than to let him live.
 And at last he dies anyhow.</p>
<p>“But suppose that the painless putting to death of all criminals were
 as deep a misfortune as it would be to—to philosophers, for example? 
Yet in the long run it would vastly lessen the total of human 
unhappiness, even of public executions. The earth was not made 
yesterday: for thousands, probably hundreds of thousands of years, men 
have been putting other men to death for crime.</p>
<p>“Even under the mild laws of to-day in civilized countries the number
 executed will in the course of the ages enormously exceed to-day’s 
total criminal population. Moreover, it would not be necessary to kill 
them all: most of them, if confronted by a law for their killing, would 
take themselves out of the country, quarter themselves upon foolish 
nations still willing to stand their nonsense—nations still enamored of 
that ancient delusion, Reformation of Criminals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span></p>
<p>“That would serve <i>your</i> purpose as well as anything, but as a 
citizen of the world, owing my first allegiance to Mankind,” concluded 
the Curmudgeon Philosopher, with a gesture appropriate to some noble 
ancestral sentiment, “I should deem it my duty to endeavor to prevent 
their escape by writs of <i>ne exeat regno</i>.”</p>

<h3 id="THE_NATURE_OF_WAR">THE NATURE OF WAR</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE Bald Campaigner was looking over the tops of his spectacle lenses, silent, obviously wise, a thing of beauty.</p>
<p>“Do you approve the punishment of General Jacob Smith, who was 
dismissed from the army for barbarism?” asked the Timorous Reporter. 
“Doubtless you remember the incident.”</p>
<p>“My approval,” said the great soldier, “is needless and of no 
significance. I have long been on the retired list myself, and am not 
the reviewing officer in this case. I think General Smith’s punishment 
just, if that’s what you want to know. He committed a serious 
indiscretion. As a commander of troops in the island of Samar he gave to
 a subordinate the following oral instructions:</p>
<p>“‘I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn; the more you kill
 and burn the better you will please me.’ He said, further, that he 
wanted all persons killed who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
 were capable of bearing arms and were in actual hostilities against the
 United States—I am quoting the Secretary of War—and, in reply to a 
question by his subordinate, asking for an age limit, designated it as 
ten years.</p>
<p>“All this was highly improper and unmilitary. It is customary in 
matters of so great importance for the commander to give his 
instructions in the form of written orders—a good commander is without a
 tongue.</p>
<p>“I am no great literary genius, but in the matter of military orders I
 know a hawk from a handsaw by the handsaw’s teeth. Suppose General 
Smith’s orders (written orders) had read like this:</p>
<p>“‘It is thought that it will be to the advantage of the expedition in
 point of celerity of movement, and will simplify the problem of supply,
 if the column be not encumbered with prisoners. The commander of the 
expedition will not be unmindful of the military advantages that flow 
from the infliction of as many casualties upon the enemy as is 
practicable with the small force that he commands and the evasive 
character of the enemy; nor will he overlook the need of removing by 
fire such structures and supplies as are incompatible with the interests
 of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span> United States, or 
inconsistent with professions of amity on the part of the island’s 
inhabitants, or conducive to the prosperity of those in rebellion. No 
person engaged in hostilities against the United States will, of course,
 be suffered to plead sex or age in mitigation of such mischances as the
 fortunes of war may entail, provided, however, that no non-combatants 
of either sex under the age of ten years shall under any circumstances 
be put to death without authority from these headquarters; the 
traditional benevolence of the American army must not be impaired.’</p>
<p>“Sir, if General Smith had issued an order like that he would to-day 
be a popular hero and an ornament to the active list of the army.”</p>
<p>Waving his remaining arm with a gesture singularly cogent and 
convincing, the Bald Campaigner ceased and marched against a hostile 
bottle near by. After study of the suppositious “order” in his 
stenographic notes, the reporter ventured the opinion that the 
difference between it and the oral instructions actually given was 
mainly one of expression. The Bald Campaigner said in reply:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>
<p>“Expression is everything. An army officer should be a master of 
expression, as a baseball pitcher should be a master of delivery. The 
straight throw and the curved throw carry the ball to the same spot, but
 consider the different effect upon the fortunes of the pitcher. What 
General Smith lacked was not heart, but style. He was not cruel, but 
clumsy. His words were destitute of charm. His blundering tongue had 
succeeded only in signifying his fitness to be thrown to the civilian 
lions.”</p>
<p>The reporter hazarded a belief that the General’s instruction to make Samar “a howling wilderness” was brutal exceedingly.</p>
<p>“Certainly it was,” assented the Bald Campaigner, “an officer of 
refinement and taste would have said: ‘It will be found expedient to 
operate against the enemy’s material resources.’ There is never a 
military necessity for coarse speech.</p>
<p>“As to devastation—did you mention devastation?—that is the purpose 
of war. War is made, not against the bodies of adult males, but against 
the means of subsistence of a people. The fighting is incident to the 
devastation: we kill the soldiers because they protect their material 
resources—get between us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span> 
and the fields that feed them, the factories that clothe them, the 
arsenals that arm them. We cannot hope to kill a great proportion of 
them at best; the humane thing is to overcome them by means of hunger 
and nakedness. The earlier we can do so, the less effusion of blood. 
Leave the enemy his resources and he will fight forever. He will beget 
soldiers faster than you can destroy them.</p>
<p>“Do you cherish the delusion that in our great civil war, for 
example, the South was subdued by killing her able-bodied males who 
could bear arms? Look at the statistics and learn, to your astonishment,
 how small a proportion of them we really did kill, even before I lost 
my arm.</p>
<p>“The killing was an incident. I speak of the latter part of the 
conflict, when we had learned how to conduct military operations. As 
long as our main purpose was bloodshed we made little progress. Our 
armies actually guarded the homes and property of the men they were sent
 to conquer—the very men that were fighting them, and who, therefore, 
assured of the comfort and safety of their families, continued fighting 
with cheerful alacrity. If we had continued that rose-water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span> policy they might have fought us to this day.”</p>
<p>The reporter involuntarily glanced at a calendar on the wall, and the war oracle continued:</p>
<p>“Wisdom came of experience: we adopted the more effective and more 
humane policy of devastation. With Sherman desolating the country from 
Atlanta to Goldsborough and Sheridan so wasting the Shenandoah Valley 
that he boasted the impossibility of a crow passing over it without 
carrying rations, the hopes of Confederate success went up in smoke.</p>
<p>“And,” concluded the hairless veteran, rising and opening the door as
 a delicate intimation that there was nothing more to say, “I beg leave 
to think that the essential character of the <i>Ultima Ratio</i> is not 
permanently obscurable by the sentimental vagaries of blithering 
civilians such as you have the lack of distinction to be.”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter retired to his base of operations and the war-drum throbbed no longer in his ear.</p>

<h3 id="HOW_TO_GROW_GREAT">HOW TO GROW GREAT</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“I&nbsp;DO not overlook the disadvantages of defeat 
in a war with some foreign power,” said the Bald Campaigner; “I only say
 that in the resulting humiliation would be a balance of advantage. It 
does a nation good to ‘eat the leek.’ The great Napoleon thrust that 
tonic vegetable into the mouths of Prussia and the other German states. 
They took a bellyful each, and the result of that penitential feast is 
the splendid German empire of to-day. Before their racial health was 
entirely restored the Germans passed the unwelcome comestible to the 
ailing dominion of Napoleon the Stuffed, and France has so thriven on 
the diet that she no longer fears the hand that wrote the <i>menu</i>. 
Alone among modern states, Great Britain has grown powerful without 
having had to cry for mercy. In the voice of supplication is heard the 
prophecy of power.”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter cautiously named our own country as one that has risen to greatness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span> without suffering defeat and humiliation.</p>
<p>“Sir, you are in error,” said the Bald Campaigner loftily. “We were 
defeated in the War of 1812. Wherever our raw volunteers met the trained
 veterans of Great Britain (except at New Orleans, when the war was 
over) we were beaten off the field. Our attempts to invade Canada were 
all repelled, our capital was taken and sacked, and when we sued for 
peace it was granted in a treaty in which the grievance for which we had
 taken up arms was contemptuously ignored.</p>
<p>“Remember that for this conflict we enlisted and equipped more than a
 half-million men, while Great Britain had at no time more than sixteen 
thousand opposing us.</p>
<p>“As historians of the conflict we have done heroic work, as have 
Southern historians of our civil war and French historians of the 
struggle with the Germans—as all beaten peoples naturally do. Sir, do 
you know that the great body of the Spanish people believe, and will 
always believe, that Spain brought us to our knees in 1898? The Russian 
who does not think that the armies of the Czar wrung the most 
humiliating terms from the Japanese is an exceptionally intelligent 
Russian—he knows enough to disbelieve the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span> ‘popular histories’ in the Russian tongue and the official falsehoods of his government.”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter inquired how a second beating would profit us, seeing that we got no good out of the other.</p>
<p>“The other was not bad enough,” the great man explained. “Having 
Napoleon on her hands, Great Britain did not, until he had been got rid 
of, make an aggressive war. When she began to we cried for mercy. What 
we need is a beating that neither our vanity can deny nor our ingenuity 
excuse—one which, in the slang of your pestilent trade, ‘will not come 
off.’”</p>
<p>“And then?”</p>
<p>“Then, sir, we shall give ourselves an army strong enough to repel 
invasion from the north, or, if something should happen to our navy, 
from the east or west. Then, sir, we shall get our soldiers by 
conscription, and the man who is drawn will serve. The words 
‘volunteer,’ ‘recruiting,’ ‘bounty,’ ‘substitute’ will disappear from 
our military vocabulary, with all the inefficiency, waste, and shame 
that they connote. In brief, we shall recognize the truth, obvious to 
reason, that a citizen owes his country military service in the same way
 that he owes it pecuniary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
 support. (If taxpaying had always been optional what an expostulation 
would meet the proposal to make it compulsory!) We shall then not need 
to concern ourselves with ‘the problem of desertion,’ ‘the effect on the
 army of high wage-rates in civil employment,’ and the rest of it. There
 will be no problem of desertion: the discernment that recognizes a 
citizen’s military obligation will find an effective method preventing 
him from running away from it. All this will come after we have been 
sorely defeated by some power, or combination of powers, that has not 
only a navy but an army.”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter hesitatingly advanced the view that a large 
standing army might seriously imperil the subordination of the military 
to the civil power.</p>
<p>“Young man,” said the hairless veteran, austerely, “you talk like a Founder of this Republic!”</p>

<h3 id="A_WAR_IN_THE_ORIENT">A WAR IN THE ORIENT</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“CONSIDERING your pro-Russian sympathies,” said the 
Timorous Reporter, “the results of some of the fighting in the Japanese 
and Russian war must have been deeply disagreeable to you—that of the 
great naval engagement in the Sea of Japan, for example.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied the Bald Campaigner, “the escape of two or three Russian ships affected me most unpleasantly.”</p>
<p>The reporter professed himself unable to understand.</p>
<p>“I had confidently expected Togo to destroy them all. He is disappointing—Togo.”</p>
<p>“Please pardon me,” said the man of letters; “I thought that you had favored the Russian cause.”</p>
<p>“So I did, sir, so I did, and do. But something is due to the art and science of war. As a soldier I stand for them, deprecating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
 any laxity in the application of the eternal principles of strategy and
 tactics by land or sea. Admiral Togo should have been dismissed for 
permitting those ships to escape.”</p>
<p>The reporter suggested the possibility that in the uproar and obscurity of battle the ships that got away were overlooked.</p>
<p>“Nothing should be overlooked,” said the Bald Campaigner. “The 
commander in battle should know everything that is going on—or going 
away. With the light that we have, I am unable to explain the Japanese 
admiral’s lamentable failure; I can only deplore it.”</p>
<p>“Had he, then, so overwhelming an advantage?” the reporter asked. “It is thought the fleets were pretty evenly matched.”</p>
<p>“Sir,” said the Bald Campaigner, loftily, “it was a fight between an 
inland people and an insular. If Rojestvensky had had a hundred 
battleships he would have been over-matched and defeated. Ships and guns
 do not make a navy, and landsmen are not transmuted into sailors by 
sending them to sea. The Russians are not a sea-going people. Their 
country has no open ports—that is what they are always fighting to get. 
They have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span> no foreign 
commerce; they have no fisheries. Why, sir, it reminds me of the reply 
made by a Scotch carter to an angry soldier who had challenged him to 
fight. ‘Fecht wi’ ye? Na, na, fechtin’s yer trade. But I’ll drive a cart
 wi’ ye.’ If command of the ocean were a matter of planting potatoes, 
Russia would be a great sea power.</p>
<p>“The born sailor is a being of an order different from ourselves—as 
different as a gull from a grouse, a seal from a cat. What, to a 
landsman, is a matter of study, memory and calculation, is to him a 
matter of intuition. An unstable plane is his natural, normal and 
helpful footing. As a gun-pointer he sights his piece not only 
consciously with his instruments and his eye, but unconsciously with 
that better instrument, the sense of direction—as one plays billiards. 
The rolling and pitching of the ships do not spoil his aim; he allows 
for them automatically—<i>feels</i> the auspicious instant with the sure
 instinct of an expert rifleman breaking bottles in the air. It is 
impossible to impart this subtle sense to a farmer’s boy, or to a 
salesman in a shop, no matter how young you catch him; he cannot be made
 to understand it—cannot even be made to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span> that it can be. For that matter, nobody does understand it.</p>
<p>“I am not unaware, sir, of the ‘modern’ methods of 
sea-fighting—keeping at a safe distance from the enemy and pointing the 
guns by means of range-finders and other instruments and machines, but 
nothing that can be invented can eliminate the ‘personal equation’ in 
sea-fighting, any more than in land-fighting parapets, casemates, 
turrets and other defensive works can profitably replace the breasts of 
the soldiers, or arms of precision take the place of their natural 
aptitude for battle with both feet on the ground. I am not unmindful of 
the time when the Romans improvised a fleet (constructed on the model of
 a wrecked Carthaginian galley) and manning it with landsmen destroyed 
the sea-power of Carthage in a single engagement. That exception tests 
the rule (<i>probat regulam</i>) but the rule stands. Landsmen for soldiers, sailors for the sea and to the devil with military machinery!</p>
<p>“Before our civil war we had a merchant marine second only to that of
 Great Britain. American sails whitened every sea, the stars and stripes
 glowed in every port. We were a nation of sailors. Even so long ago as 
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span> war of 1812 we held 
our own with Great Britain on the ocean, though beaten everywhere on 
land by inferior numbers with superior training. To-day we could not 
hold our own against any maritime people, even if we fought with full 
coal-bunkers near our own shores. The American behind the gun is no 
longer a born sailor with the salt of the sea in every globule of the 
blood of him. Our fate in encountering a seagoing people, sailors and 
fishermen and the sons of sailors and fishermen, with sea legs, sea eyes
 and sea souls, would be that which has befallen inlanders against 
islanders, from Salamis to Tsu Shima. The sea would be strewn with a 
wreckage of American ‘magnificent fighting-machines.’”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter murmured the words “Manila Bay” and “Santiago 
de Cuba,” then diffidently lifted his eyes, with a question mark in 
each, to the face of his distinguished interlocutor—which darkened with a
 smile.</p>
<p>“With regard to Manila,” he said, “I am told that Dewey’s famous 
command, ‘You may fire when you are ready, Gridley,’ was not accurately 
reported. According to my informant, the Spanish ships were ingeniously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
 wound with ropes to keep them from falling apart. What Dewey actually 
said was this: ‘When you are ready, Gridley, you may fire at those 
ropes.’ Anybody can cut a rope with a cannon if not molested. At 
Santiago, the Spanish Admiral was ordered not to give battle, but to 
escape, and ships cannot run away and fight at the same time.</p>
<p>“Sir, two naval victories in which the victors lost one man killed do
 not supply a reasonable presumption of invincibility. Manila and 
Santiago were slaughters, not battles. They are without value.”</p>
<p>The reporter said he thought that they were not altogether worthless 
as “horrors of war,” and visibly shuddered. The superior intelligence 
flamed and thundered!</p>
<p>“That is all nonsense about ‘the horrors of war,’ in so far as the 
detestable phrase implies that they are worse than those of peace; they 
are more striking and impressive, that is all. As to the loss of life, I
 submit that civilians mostly die some time, and are mourned, too, quite
 as feelingly as soldiers; and the kind of death that is inflicted by 
war-weapons is distinctly less objectionable than that resulting from 
disease. Wars are expensive, doubtless, but somebody gets the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
 money; it is not thrown into the sea. In point of fact, modern nations 
are never so prosperous as in the years immediately succeeding a great 
war. I favor anything that will quicken our minds, elevate our 
sentiments and stop our secreting selfishness, as, according to that 
eminent naturalist, the late William Shakspeare, toads get venom by 
sleeping under cold stones. A quarter-century of peace will make a 
nation of block-heads and scoundrels. Patriotism is a vice, but it is a 
larger vice, and a nobler, than the million petty ones which it promotes
 in peace to swallow up in war. In the thunder of guns it becomes 
respectable. I favor war, famine, pestilence—anything that will stop the
 people from cheating and confine that practice to contractors and 
statesmen.</p>
<p>“To return to Russia—”</p>
<p>“Which,” said the reporter, <i>sotto voce</i>, “many Russians abroad do not care to do.”</p>
<p>“You said, I think, that she does not seem to be much of a power on 
either sea or land. She was a power in the time of the first Napoleon. 
She held out a long time at Sevastopol against the English, the French, 
the Turks and the Sardinians. She defeated the Turks at Shipka Pass and 
Plevna, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span> Turks are 
the best soldiers in Europe. True, in the war with Japan, she lost every
 battle. That was to be expected, for she was all unready and her armies
 were outnumbered two to one from the beginning. No one outside Russia, 
and few inside, has ever come within a quarter million of a correct 
estimate of the Japanese strength. There were not fewer than seven 
hundred thousand of these cantankerous little devils in front of Gunshu 
Pass.”</p>
<p>“Then they are—in a military sense—‘cantankerous,’” said the 
reporter. “That is about the same as saying that they are good soldiers,
 is it not?”</p>
<p>“Oh, they fight well enough. Why shouldn’t they? They have something 
to fight for; the pride of an honorable history; a government that does 
not rob them; a civilization that is to them new and fascinating, 
reared, as the superstructure of a glittering temple, upon an elder one,
 whose stones were hewn and laid and wrought into beauty by their 
forefathers, while ours were chasing one another through marshes with 
flint spears. Best of all, they had a sovereign whom they adore as a 
deity and love with a passionate personal attachment. What can you do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
 against such a people as that?—a people in whom patriotism is a 
religion—a nation of poets, artists and philosophers, like the ancient 
Greeks; of statesmen and warriors, like those of early Rome?”</p>
<p>“If the Japanese are all that you think them,” said the reporter, “how do you justify your pro-Russian sympathies?”</p>
<p>“It is not the business of a student of military affairs to have 
sympathies,” replied the Bald Campaigner, coldly; “but it is precisely 
because they are that kind of people that their overthrow is, to 
America, a military necessity. They are dangerous neighbors to so feeble
 barbarians as we, with a government which all extol and none respects—a
 loose unity and no illusions—a slack allegiance and no consciousness of
 national life—a bickering aggregation of individuals, man against man 
and class against class—a motley crowd of lawless, turbulent and 
avaricious ungovernables!”</p>
<p>He paused from exhaustion and mopped his shining pow with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>“Maybe Americans are like that,” assented the reporter, “but it is 
said that we fight pretty well on occasion—in a civil war, for example.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span></p>
<p>“Certainly, all Caucasians fight ‘pretty well’ compared with other Caucasians. The Japs are another breed.”</p>
<p>The Inquiring Mind was convinced, but not silenced. “Suppose,” said 
he, “that a collision ever occurs between an American and a Japanese 
fleet or army on equal terms, what, in your honest judgment as a 
military expert, will be the result?”</p>
<p>“Damn them!” shouted the man of no sympathies, “we’ll wipe them off the face of the earth!”</p>

<h3 id="A_JUST_DECISION">A JUST DECISION</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“AH, I have long hoped for this,” said the Sentimental Bachelor.</p>
<p>“It is a good while now—I think it must be ever since Adam—that 
Tyrant Man has had to pay all too dearly for the favor—and favors—of the
 unfair sex. Of course, there is a difference in the value of the 
advantages enjoyed. For illustration, there is the good will of Celeste,
 of Babette, of Clarisse—best of all, of the incomparable Clorinda! I 
say good will, for I speak of that which I myself have had the supreme 
distinction to enjoy; and no gentleman, sir, will ever so far forget 
himself as to call a lady’s preference for him by a stronger name. 
Discretion, sir, discretion—that is what every man of sense and feeling 
goes in for.”</p>
<p>The Timorous Reporter signified such approval as was consistent with the public interest and the prosperity of the press.</p>
<p>“As I was saying, the good will of the admirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
 Nanette, the most excellent Lucia—excellent no longer, alas, for she is
 dead—of the superb Héloise, and I might, perhaps, add to the list one 
or two others, is above price and beyond appraisement. Yet it was not to
 be had for nothing; the gods are not so kind. I have suffered, sir, I 
have paid, believe me.</p>
<p>“What am I coming to? Why, this, my lad, this. The supreme court of 
one of our States has decided that, in proving an intention of marriage 
on the part of a male defendant, what the lady plaintiff may have said 
to others about it is not competent evidence. ‘Hearsay evidence’? Why, 
yes; the honorable court was polite enough to call it so, but, 
doubtless, if, with all due respect for the ladies mentioned—Herminia, 
Adèle, Demetria and the others—I may venture to say so, the real ground 
of exclusion of such evidence is its incredibility. I trust to your 
discretion not to report me as uttering that opinion; not for the world 
would I wound the sensibilities of the adorable Miranda, most veracious 
of her sex.”</p>
<p>The speaker paused, gazing pensively at vacancy as if communing with the day before yesterday. The reporter endeavored to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span> reveal by his manner a policy of expectation.</p>
<p>“My dear boy,” resumed the Sentimental Bachelor, “if you aspire to 
the good will of a woman, and are marriageable, you should be prepared 
and willing to have it believed by all her friends that your intentions 
are honorable—yes, sir; you must submit to be placed in that false 
position: it is a part of the price. True, you may swear the lady to 
secrecy; and Congreve says that no one is so good as a woman to keep a 
secret, for, although she is sure to tell it, yet nobody will believe 
her. Alas! he underestimated human credulity, which is the eighth wonder
 of the world. Beware of human credulity; it is always ready to believe 
the worst.</p>
<p>“What’s that? You have had sweethearts that did not say you wanted to
 marry them; women friends that did not say you were in love with them? 
Fortunate man! But consider how young you are. It is a just inference 
that they too are young. Youth is the season of veracity; wait. As these
 excellent young ladies (whom Heaven bless) grow older—as they miss more
 and more the attentions of men—as they dwell more and more upon joys of
 the irrevocable past, they will have a different story to tell, and 
right mercifully is it decreed that they shall believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
 it themselves. Why, even the once charming Doretta finds, I am told, a 
consolation for the horrors of age and whist in the dream of repeated 
proposals from me—Meeee! Ah, well, it were inhuman to deny to one to 
whom I gave so much the happiness of stating the amount of the 
benefaction. Far be it from me to bring down her gray hairs in sorrow to
 the truth.</p>
<p>“But, suppose, my dear young friend, that I were wealthy enough to be
 sued for breach of promise of marriage—which Heaven forbid! You see how
 this righteous decision of that supreme court would remove from me the 
temptation and necessity of contradicting a lady. Oh, it is a great 
decision! It marks a notable advance in the apprehension of the 
underlying motives of human action. For they are human—except Iphigenia,
 who is divine. Not so beautiful as Perdita; not so intelligent as 
Lorena; not so devoted as Janette; so young as Marie; so faithful as 
Theodora—peerless Theodora! But Iphigenia—she has the cleverness to be 
so very new! It makes a difference.”</p>
<p>Remarking that Bulwer was a most admirable writer, the Timorous Reporter took his leave.</p>

<h3 id="THE_LIONS_DEN">THE LION’S DEN</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">“I&nbsp;CAN not accept the view,” said the 
Sentimental Bachelor, looking up from his piano stool, “that because one
 has a houseful of books and pictures one is necessarily a lover of 
literature and art. I have a few myself—not many; but you will observe 
that my book-cases have not glass doors; on the contrary (if you 
understand the significance of that phrase), they are beautiful examples
 of the cabinetmaker’s craft, harmonizing well with the architectural 
and color schemes of the rooms containing them. But the devil a book can
 you see in them without opening them.</p>
<p>“Why is that? Because, in the first place, books are not beautiful—at
 least none of those within the means of any but a millionaire. Even the
 most costly and sumptuous of them are angular, blocklike objects, 
displeasing to the eye. Unless bound with special reference to the room 
in which they are to turn their backs on you, most of them will be out 
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span> harmony with their environment and with one another.</p>
<p>“Yes, you see here scattered about, mostly on the floor, a few books”
 (the Sentimental Bachelor indicated them by a graceful gesture of his 
right hand) “that are as unlovely as any. But these are volumes having 
for me a peculiar value from pleasant or tender association—just as any 
article might have—just, in fact, as that rug has, upon which the divine
 Janette has deigned to set her little feet. Ah, Janette the 
adorable!—Melissa being dead.</p>
<p>“You dare to think, no doubt, that with glass doors to my book-cases I
 should be better able to find readily any particular volume that I 
might want. Pardon me, but it is unworthy of you to impute to me so deep
 and dark an ignorance. I should be sorry if ever I failed to put my 
hand on any desired book in the darkest night. Believe me, my friend, it
 is not the book-lover who displays his books in a show-case.</p>
<p>“As to pictures, if I were so unfortunate as to own all the treasures
 of the Dresden galleries, you would see no more than one painting in a 
room. That is the Japanese way, and the Japanese are the only civilized 
people in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span> our modern 
world; they are born artists all, though some neglect their mental 
heritage and go out as cooks. Think of it!—a people among whom the 
arranging of three cut flowers in a vase (they know not the dreadful 
‘bouquet’) is an art having its principles and laws, its learned 
professors to expound them, its honorable place in the curriculum of 
public and private education!</p>
<p>“Trust the Japanese to be always right in a matter of art. His 
instinct is as infallible as that of the ancient Greek; and our European
 ‘schools’ of painting are already greatly indebted to him. It is a 
silly new picture in which the Japanese influence can not be traced. I’m
 ordering my dependent young brother from Paris to Tokio to study 
art—the little rascal!</p>
<p>“One painting in a room fixes attention; two divide it; more than two
 disperse it. Than a wall plastered with bad canvases I know of nothing 
more distracting and confusing except a wall plastered with good ones. 
It is like a swarm of pretty girls, or a table d’hôte dinner in a 
country hotel, where all you are to eat is brought in at once and 
arranged round your plate. It kills the appetite.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span></p>
<p>“Why does one do that sort of thing? To impress one’s visitors—to 
show off. No, no; it is not because one is fond of paintings and never 
tires of them. Be pleased to exercise your faculty of observation. I 
passed a few weeks recently at the country house of a friend. Before I 
had been half an hour in the place he had taken me through all the rooms
 and shown me a hundred of his ‘art treasures’—paintings by famous 
‘masters.’ (Maybe I had my own opinion as to that.) For my pleasure? 
Why, no; he allowed me less than a half minute to each. Gadzooks! can a 
fellow digest a painting that he has <i>bolted</i>? No, sir; ’twas for 
gratification of his vanity of possession. During the weeks that I 
remained in his house I never once caught him, nor any member of his 
family, standing before any one of all those pictures, silently ‘taking 
it in.’ The purpose of the pictures was to supply an opportunity for his
 visitors’ envy and compel their tongues to the service of his ears.</p>
<p>“You observe on my walls here,” the veteran virtuoso continued, 
revolving slowly on his pivot, “one water-color and a lot of 
trifles—photographs, pen-and-ink drawings, and so forth—most of them 
rather bad. The painting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span> 
itself is none too good; I should not like to have my taste in such 
things judged by it. But observe: it is the work of a young friend, and 
into every inch of it he has put something of his heart, for it was done
 in the hope of pleasing me. The carved oak frame, too, is one of his 
own creation, the mat (of copper)—all. Would the costliest and ugliest 
of old masters give me as much pleasure? You, yes; but, dear fellow, you
 are not considered.</p>
<p>“See that pen-and-ink head—there are better. But it is a first 
attempt, done by the uninstructed young girl whose photograph you see 
alongside. She is to be a great artist some day, but none of her work 
will have to me the interest and value of that.</p>
<p>“Ah, those faded and soiled little photographs—Mary, Hélène, Katy, 
the divine Josie and the rest—you need not look at them; they are merely
 little soft spots for <i>my</i> eyes to fall upon and rest. Why, sir, 
there’s not the most trifling object in this room but has a hundred 
tender recollections clinging to it like bats to a stalactite—swarming 
about it like bees about Hymettus. Should I replace them with ‘works of 
art’ bought in the shops and damnably authenticated?</p>
<p>“This room is for me. I live here, read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
 here, write here, smoke here. Wherever my eye falls, it rests upon 
something that starts a train of thought and emotion infinitely more 
agreeable, and I believe more profitable, than any suggested by the work
 of a hand that I never grasped, guided by however sure an eye that 
never looked into mine. Don’t, I pray you, take the trouble to appear to
 be interested in these things, such as a country maiden might decorate 
her sleeping room withal. (Ah, happy country maiden, untaught in the 
black art of showing off!) Don’t, I beg, give anything here a second 
glance: ‘there was no thought of pleasing thee’ when it was put here.</p>
<p>“Come,” concluded the Sentimental Bachelor, taking his hat and stick,
 “let us go to the Park. I want to show you the fine Rembrandt that I 
presented to the Art Gallery. Celestine adored it.”</p>

<h3 id="A_FLOURISHING_INDUSTRY">A FLOURISHING INDUSTRY</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE infant industry of buying worthless cattle, 
inoculating them with pleuro-pneumonia and tuberculosis, and collecting 
the indemnity when they are officially put to death to prevent the 
spread of the contagion, is assuming something of the importance and 
dignity of a national pursuit. The proprietors of one of the largest 
contageries on Long Island report that the outlook is most encouraging; 
they begin each fiscal year with a large surplus in their treasury. Some
 of the Western companies, too, have been highly prosperous and intend 
to mark their gratification by an immediate issue of new shares as a 
bonus.</p>
<p>The effect of this industry upon pastoral pursuits is wholesome. The 
stock ranges of Texas, Wyoming and Montana thrill with a new life, and 
it is estimated that their enlargement during the next few years will 
bring not less than five million acres of public land into the service 
of man and beast. The advantage to manufacturers of barbed-wire fencing 
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span> obvious, while the 
indirect benefit to agriculture through the enhanced price of this now 
indispensable material will supply the protectionist with a new argument
 and a peculiar happiness. Cattle-growing has hitherto been attended 
with great waste. A large percentage of the “stock on hand” was 
unsalable. Failure of the cactus crop, destitution of water and 
prevalence of blizzards, together with such natural ills as cattle flesh
 is heir to, have frequently so reduced the physical condition of the 
herds that not more than a half would be acceptable to the buyer. The 
ailing remainder were of little use. A few of the larger animals could 
be utilized by preparing them as skeletons of buffaloes for Eastern 
museums of natural history, but the demand was limited: nine in ten were
 suffered to expire and become a dead loss. These are now eagerly sought
 by agents of the contageries, purchased at good prices, driven by easy 
stages to the railways and, arriving at their final destination, duly 
infected. They are said to require less infection than they would if 
they were in good condition, with what the life insurance companies are 
pleased to call a fair “expectation of life.” Some of the breeders 
prefer to isolate these failures and do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
 their own infecting; but the tendency in the cattle trade, as in all 
others, is toward division of labor. The regular infectionaries possess 
superior facilities of inoculation, and government inspectors prefer to 
do business at a few great pleuro-pneumoniacal and tubercular centers 
rather than make tedious journeys to distant ranges. The trend of the 
age is, in fact, toward centralization.</p>
<p>The effect of the new industry upon commerce cannot be accurately 
foreseen, but it is natural to suppose that it will largely increase the
 importation of lowgrade cattle from South America. Hitherto it has not 
been profitable to import any that were unfit for beef. But if the <i>Bos inedibilis</i>,
 the milkless crowbait and other varieties “not too good for human 
nature’s daily food”—in fact not good enough—can be laid down in New 
York or New Orleans at a cost of not more than thirty dollars each, 
including the purchase price of ten cents, and inoculated before they 
have eaten their heads off, there would seem to be a reasonable margin 
of profit in the traffic. If not, the legal allowance for their 
condemnation and slaughter can be easily increased by legislative 
action. If Congress will do nothing to encourage capital in that 
direction the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span> States most 
benefited by this extension of American commerce can respond to the 
demand of the hour with a judicious system of bounties. Importation of 
cheap foreign cattle eligible to pleuro-pneumonia and the junior 
disorder will provide employment to a great number of persons who, 
without apt appropriation’s artful aid, might languish on farms and in 
workshops, a burden to the community and a sore trial to themselves.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE will be joy in the household of the country 
editor what time the rural mind shall no longer crave the unwholesome 
stimuli provided by composing accounts of corpulent beetroots, bloated 
pumpkins, dropsical melons, aspiring maize, and precocious cabbages. 
Then the bucolic journalist shall have surcease of toil, and may go out 
upon the meads to frisk with kindred lambs, frolic familiarly with 
loose-jointed colts and exchange grave gambolings with solemn cows. Then
 shall the voice of the press, no longer attuned to praise of the 
vegetable kingdom, find a more humble but not less useful employment in 
calling the animal kingdom to the evening meal beneath the sanctum 
window.</p>
<p>To the overworked editor life will have a fresh zest, a new and 
quickening significance. The hills shall seem to hump more greenly up to
 a bluer sky, the fields to blush with a tenderer sunshine. He will go

Giver of All Swill he will be jubilant in the editorial feet, blissfully
 conscious that the editorial intellect is a-ripening for the morrow’s 
work.</p>
<p>The rural newspaper! We sit with it in hand, running our fingers over
 the big, staring letters, as over the black and white keys of a piano, 
drumming out of them a mild melody of perfect repose. With what delight 
one disports him in the deep void of its nothingness, as who should swim
 in air! Here is nothing to startle, nothing to wound. The very 
atmosphere is suffused and saturated with “the spirit of the rural 
press;” and even one’s dog sits by, slowly dropping the lids over its 
great eyes; then lifting them with a jerk, tries to look as if it were 
not sleepy in the least degree. A fragrance of plowed fields comes to 
one like a benediction. The tinkle of ghostly cowbells falls drowsily 
upon the ear. Airy figures of prize esculents float before the half-shut
 eyes and vanish before perfect vision can attain to them. Above and 
about are the drone of bees and the muffled thunder of milk-streams 
shooting into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span> foaming 
bucket. The gabble of distant geese is faintly marked off by the barking
 of a distant dog. The city, with all its noises, sinks away, as from 
one in a balloon, and our senses swim in the “intense inane” of country 
languor. We slumber.</p>

<h3 id="TO_ELEVATE_THE_STAGE">“TO ELEVATE THE STAGE”</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE existence of a theatrical company, composed entirely of Cambridge and Harvard <i>alumni</i>
 who have been in jail strikes the imagination with a peculiar force. In
 the theatrical world the ideal condition conceived by certain social 
philosophers is being rapidly realized and reduced to practice. “It does
 not matter,” say these superior persons, “what one does; it is only 
important what one is.” The theater folk have long been taking that view
 of things, as is amply attested by the histrionic careers (for 
examples) of Mrs. Lily Langtry and Mr. John L. Sullivan. Managers—and, 
we may add, the public—do not consider it of the least importance what 
Mrs. Langtry <i>does</i> on the stage, nor how she does it, so long as she <i>is</i>
 a former favorite of a Prince and a tolerably fair counterpart of a 
Jersey cow. And who cares what Mr. Sullivan’s pronunciation of the word 
“mother” may be, or what degree of sobriety he may strive to 
simulate?—in seeing his performance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span> we derive all our delight from the consciousness of the great and godlike thing that he has the goodness to <i>be</i>.</p>
<p>It is needless to recall other instances; every playgoer’s memory is 
richly stored with them; but this troupe of convicted collegians is the 
frankest application of the principle to which we have yet been treated.
 At the same time, it opens up “vistas” of possibilities extending 
far-and-away beyond what was but yesterday the longest reach of 
conjecture. Why should we stop with a troupe of educated felons? Let us 
recognize the principle to the full and apply it with logical heroism, 
unstayed by considerations of taste and sense. Let us have theater 
companies composed of reformed assassins who have been preachers. A 
company of deaf mutes whose grandfathers were hanged, would prove a 
magnetic “attraction” and play to good houses—that is to say, they would
 <i>be</i> to good houses. In a troupe of senators with warts on their 
noses the pleasure-shoving public would find an infinite gratification 
and delight. It might lack the allurement of feminine charm, most 
senators being rather old women, but for magnificent inaction it would 
bear the palm. Even better would be a company of distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
 corpses supporting some such star inactor, as the mummy of his late 
Majesty, Rameses II of Egypt. In them the do-nothing-be-something 
principle would have its highest, ripest and richest development. In the
 broad blaze of their histrionic glory Mrs. Langtry would pale her 
uneffectual fire and Mr. Sullivan hide his diminished head.</p>
<p>From the example of such a company streams of good would radiate in 
every direction, with countless ramifications. Not only would it 
accomplish the long desired “elevation of the stage” to such a plane 
that even the pulpit need not be ashamed to work with it in elicitation 
of the human snore, but it would spread the light over other arts and 
industries, causing “the dawn of a new era” generally. Even with the 
comparatively slow progress we are making now, it is not unreasonable to
 hope that eventually Man will cease his fussy activity altogether and 
do nothing whatever, each individual of the species becoming a veritable
 monument of philosophical inaction, rapt in the contemplation of his 
own abstract worth and perhaps taking root where he stands to survey it.</p>

<h3 id="PECTOLITE">PECTOLITE</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THIS is one of the younger group of minerals: it was
 discovered by a German scientist in 1828. For its age it is an 
exceptionally interesting stone—if it is a stone. Its most eminent and 
distinguishing peculiarity is described as the “property of parting with
 minute splinters from its surface upon being handled, these splinters 
or spicules piercing the hand, producing a pain similar to that 
experienced by contact with a nettle.”</p>
<p>In the mineral kingdom pectolite ought to take high rank, near the 
very throne. In its power of annoying man it is a formidable competitor 
to several illustrious members of the vegetable kingdom, such as the 
nettle, the cactus, the poison ivy and the domestic briar. There are, 
indeed, several members of the animal kingdom which hardly excel it in 
the power of producing human misery. Considering its remarkable aptitude
 in that bad way its rarity is somewhat difficult to understand, and is 
perhaps more apparent than real. Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
 Hanks says that previously to its discovery in California it had been 
found in only eight places. If upon investigation these should turn out 
to be Europe, Asia, Africa, North and South America, Australia and the 
two Polar continents, the unnatural discrepancy between its 
objectionable character and its narrow distribution would be explained 
away, and pectolite seen to be “in touch” with its sister malevolences, 
whose abundance is usually in the direct ratio of their noxiousness to 
man.</p>
<p>In his efforts to make this uncommon mineral known, advance its 
interests and bring it into closer relations with mankind, Professor 
Hanks is winning golden opinions from the manufacturer of arsenic, the 
promoter of the Canadian thistle, and the local agent of the imported 
rattlesnake. The various uses to which it can be put are obvious and 
numberless. As a missile in a riot—the impeller wearing a glove, but the
 other person having nothing to guard his face and eyes—its field of 
usefulness will be wide and fertile. Small fragments of it attractively 
displayed here and there about the city will give a rich return of agony
 when thoughtlessly picked up. For village sidewalks inimical to the 
thin shoe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span> of the period it
 would be entirely superior to the knotty plank studded with projecting 
nail heads. With a view to these various “uses of adversity,” it would 
be well for Professor Hanks to submit careful estimates of the cost of 
quarrying it and transporting it to places where it can be made to do 
the greatest harm to the greatest number. To assist and further the 
purposes of Nature, as manifested in the character of the several 
agencies and materials which she employs, is the greatest glory of 
science. A human being assailed by all the natural forces, seizing a 
stone to defend himself and getting a fistful of pectolitic spiculæ, is a
 spectacle in which one can get as near and clear a glimpse of the Great
 Mystery as in any; and science is now prepared to supply the stone.</p>

Anderson—sometimes, I think, called “Our Mary”—was an accomplished 
baker. Among her personal friends, those at least who had the happiness 
to dine at her home, she had a distinguished reputation as a 
bread-maker. She was once persuaded to make public the prescription that
 she used, through the London <i>Times</i>, thus materially enlarging 
her practice by addition of many new patients. I regret my inability to 
reproduce the prescription here for the benefit of such house-keepers as
 are unfettered by Colonial tradition—who, not having inherited the New

light of a later dispensation. For bread-making is, I think, a 
progressive science in which perfection is not attained at a bound by 
merely “dissolving the political bands” which connect one country with 
another.</p>
<p>History is garrulous of our Revolutionary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
 sires: their virtues and other vices are abundantly extolled; but 
concerning our Revolutionary dames the trumpet of fame remains 
mysteriously and significantly reticent—a phenomenon not easily 
accounted for on any hypothesis which assumes or concedes their worth. 
Historians, poets and those, generally, who have possession of the 
public ear and hold it from generation to generation, seem to feel that 
the less said about these merry old girls the better. I believe the 
secret of it lies in the consciousness of the literary class that the 
mothers of the Republic made treasonably bad bread, and that their sins 
of that sort are being visited upon their children, even to these third 
and fourth generations, and (which is worse) practiced by them. No doubt
 the success of the Revolutionary War would have been achieved later if 
our brave grandfathers had not been fortified in body and spirit by 
privation of the domestic loaf of the period, known to us through the 
domestic loaf of our own. To immunity from the latter desolating agency 
the soldiers on both sides in the more recent and greater conflict were 
obviously indebted for the development of that martial spirit which made
 them so reluctant to stop fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
 and go home. It must be said, however, in defence of the Bread of Our 
Union that if one is going to eat the salt-spangled butter which also 
appertains to the home of the brave it really does not greatly matter 
what one eats it on.</p>
<p>America’s dyspepsia is not entirely the product of the frying-pan, 
the pie and the use of the stop-watch at meals. Any wholesome reform in 
bread-making as practiced darkly in the secrecy of our kitchens, will 
materially mitigate the national disorder; though even bread made 
according to the plans and specifications of Our Mary can hardly be 
expected to manifest all its virtues if eaten blazing hot. Whatever may 
be the outcome of Mistress Mary’s quite contrary way of imparting her 
sacred secret to a foreign newspaper and ignoring the press of her own 
country—whether anybody now compounds bread after her prescription or 
not, or if anybody does, whether anybody else will eat it—this much was 
accomplished: she showed that at least one American woman was not afraid
 to tell the world and the public prosecutors how she made bread. As a 
bread-maker she was indubitably gifted with the divine audacity of 
genius.</p>

<h3 id="ADVICE_TO_OLD_MEN">ADVICE TO OLD MEN</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT goes without saying that among the elements of 
success a broad and liberal total abstinence is chief. The old man who 
gets drunk before dinner is born to failure as the sparks fly upward. 
Diligence in business is another qualification that needs not be 
particularly dwelt upon; the old man who seeks his ease while his young 
and energetic employees, trained to habits of industry, are stealing all
 the profits of the business will find his finish where he did not lose 
it. He is beyond the reach of remonstrance.</p>
<p>Study the rising old man. You will find him invariably distinguished 
by seriousness. He is not given to frivolity. He does not play at 
football. He does not contribute jokes to the comic papers. He does not 
waste his time kissing the girls. The rising old man is all business. We
 can all be that way if we are old enough to have no infrangible habits.</p>
<p>As to manners, and these are of the utmost importance, a deferential and reverent attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
 toward youth has a commercial value that it would be hard to appraise 
too highly. Remember, old man, that the youth whom you employ to-day you
 may serve to-morrow, if he will have you. It is worth while to make him
 admire you, and the best way to do so is to show him that you respect 
him. There are certain virtues that win the admiration of all; let him 
think that you think that he has them.</p>
<p>A most desirable quality in an old man is modesty. It is not only 
valuable as a mental equipment necessary to success, it is right and 
just that you should have it. Pray do not forget, in the exultation of 
growing old, that age is peculiarly liable to error through the glamour 
of experience. To the errors of age and experience are attributable most
 of those failures which come to us in the later life. We can not help 
being old, but Heaven has not denied us the opportunity to take counsel 
of youth and ignorance. Some one has said that the way to succeed is to 
think like a philosopher and then act like a fool. The thinking being 
needless, a mere intellectual luxury, and therefore a sinful waste of 
the time allowed us for another and better purpose, renounce it. As to 
action, study the young. Every successful man was once young.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span></p>
<p>Do not try to get anything for nothing: when you have obtained a 
liberal discount for cash you have done much; do the rest by paying the 
cash. An honest old man is the pride and glory of his son.</p>
<p>Dig, save, fast, go as nearly naked as the law allows, and if Heaven 
does not reward you with success you will nevertheless have the 
satisfaction that comes of the consciousness of being a glittering 
example to American age.</p>

<h3 id="A_DUBIOUS_VINDICATION">A DUBIOUS VINDICATION</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">HARDLY any class of persons enjoys complete immunity
 from injustice and calumny, even if “armed with the ballot”; but 
probably no class has so severely suffered from Slander’s mordant tooth 
as our man-eating brethren of that indefinite region known as the 
“Cannibal Islands.” Nations which do not eat themselves, and which, with
 even greater self-denial, refrain from banqueting on other nations, 
have for generations been subjected to a species of criticism that must 
be a sore trial to their patience. Every reprobate among us who has 
sense enough to push a pencil along the measured mile of a day’s task in
 a newspaper office without telling the truth has experienced a sinful 
pleasure in representing anthropophagi as persons of imperfect 
refinement and ailing morals. They have been censured even, for murder; 
though surely it is kinder to take the life of a man whom you set apart 
for your dinner than to eat him struggling. It has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span> been said of them that they are particularly partial to the flesh of missionaries.</p>
<p>It appears that this is not so. The Rev. Mr. Hopkins, of the 
Methodist Church, who returned to New York after a residence of fifteen 
years in the various islands of the South Pacific, assured his brethren 
that in all that period he could not recollect a single instance in 
which he was made to feel himself a comestible. He averred that his 
spiritual character was everywhere recognized, and so far as he knew he 
was never in peril of being put to the tooth.</p>
<p>His testimony, unluckily, has not the value that its obvious 
sincerity and truth merit. In point of physical structure he was 
conspicuously inedible; so much so, in truth, that an unsympathetic 
reporter coldly described him as “fibrous” and declared that in a 
country where appetizers are unknown and pepsin a medicine of the 
future, Mr. Hopkins could under no circumstances cut any figure as a 
viand. And this same writer meaningly inquired of the cartilaginous 
missionary the present address of one “Fatty Dawson.”</p>
<p>Fully to understand the withering sarcasm of this inquiry it is 
necessary to know that the person whose whereabouts it was desired to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
 ascertain was a co-worker of Mr. Hopkins in the same missionary field. 
His success in spreading the light was such as to attract the notice of 
the native king. In the last letter received from Mr. Dawson he 
explained that that potentate had just done him the honor to invite him 
to dinner.</p>
<p>Mr. Hopkins being a missionary, one naturally prefers his views to 
those of anyone who is still in the bonds of iniquity, and moreover, 
writes for the newspapers; nevertheless, I do not see that any harm 
would come of a plain statement of the facts in the case of the Rev. Mr.
 Dawson. He was not eaten by the dusky monarch—in the face of Mr. 
Hopkins’ solemn assurance that cannibalism is a myth, it is impossible 
to believe that Mr. Dawson was himself the dinner to which he was 
invited. That he was eaten by Mr. Hopkins himself is a proposition so 
abysmally horrible that none but the hardiest and most impenitent 
calumniator would have the depravity to suggest it.</p>

<h3 id="THE_JAMAICAN_MONGOOSE">THE JAMAICAN MONGOOSE</h3>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">WHEN man undertakes for some sordid purpose to 
disturb the balance of natural forces concerned in the conservation and 
in the destruction of life on this planet he is all too likely to err. 
For example, when some public-spirited Australian, observing a dearth of
 donkeys in his great lone land, thoughtfully imported a shipload of 
rabbits, believing that they would grow up with the country, learn to 
carry loads and eventually bray, he performed a disservice to his fellow
 colonists which they would gladly requite by skinning him alive if they
 could lay hands on him. It is well known that our thoughtless 
extermination of the American Indian has been followed by an 
incalculable increase of the grasshoppers which once served him as food.
 So strained is the resulting situation that some of our most prominent 
seers are baffled in attempting to forecast the outcome; and it is said 
that the Secretary of Agriculture holds that farming on this continent 
is doomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span> unless we take to a grasshopper diet ourselves.</p>
<p>The matter lends itself to facile illustration: one could multiply 
instances to infinity. We might cite the Australian ladybird, which was 
by twenty well defined and several scientists brought here and 
acclimated at great expense to feed upon a certain fruit pest, but 
which, so far, has confined its ravages mainly to the fruit.</p>
<p>The latest, and in some ways the most striking, instance of the peril
 of making a redistribution of the world’s fauna, is supplied by the 
beautiful tropical isle of Jamaica, home of the Demon Rum. It appears 
that someone in Jamaica was imperfectly enamored of the native rats, 
which are creatures of eminent predacity, intrepid to a degree that is 
most disquieting. This person introduced from a foreign land the 
mongoose—an animal whose name it seems prudent to give in the singular 
number. The mongoose, as is well known, is affected with an objection to
 rats compared with which the natural animosity of a dog to another dog 
is a mild passion indeed, and that of a collector of customs to holy 
water seems hardly more than a slight coolness. Jamaica is now ratless, 
but, alas, surpassingly tickful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
 The ticks have so multiplied upon the face of the earth that man and 
beast are in equal danger of extinction. The people hardly dare venture 
out-of-doors to plant the rum vine and help the north-bound steamers to 
take on monkeys. The mongoose alone is immune to ticks.</p>
<p>It appears that when this creature had effaced the rats it was itself
 threatened with effacement from lack of comestible suited to its tooth;
 but instead of wasting its life in repinings and unavailing 
regrets—instead of yielding to the insidious importunities of nostalgia,
 it fell upon the lizards and banqueted royally if roughly; and soon the
 lizards had gone to join the rats in the Unknown. Now, the Jamaica 
lizard had for countless ages “wittled free” upon ticks, maintaining 
among them a high death-rate with which, apparently, their own dietetic 
excesses (for ticks are greatly addicted to the pleasures of the table) 
had nothing to do. The lizard abating his ravages, through being himself
 abated by the mongoose, the tick holds dominion by the unchallenged 
authority of numbers. Man, the whilom tyrant, flees to his mountain 
fastnesses, the rum vine withers in the fields and the north-bound 
steamer sails monkeyless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span> 
away. Jamaica’s last state is worse than her first and almost as bad as 
ours. She is as yet, however, spared the last and lowest humiliation 
that a brave and generous people can experience; her parasites do not 
pose as patriots, nor tickle the vanity of those whom they bleed.</p>

no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in 
such states who approach us with offers to donate.</div>
<div class="c2">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we 
cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations 
received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small
 staff.</div>
<div class="c2">Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current
 donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of 
other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<div class="c12">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</div>
<div class="c2">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the 
Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could 
be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and 
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of 
volunteer support.</div>
<div class="c2">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several
 printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by 
copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do
 not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper 
edition.</div>
<div class="c2">Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</div>
<div class="c2">This website includes information about Project 
Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg 
Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how
 to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</div>
