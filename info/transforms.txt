==========================================
html:
load text, parse to tree
remove namespace from elements
remove <head>
cleanup:
	perform operations on etree nodes:
	strip_pg_boilerplate() - clear nodes
	if not self.args.css_no_default: - default transformations
		self.mycss = DEFAULT_TRANSFORM_CSS
	css_smallcaps() - to upper, lower, cap
	css_bold() - surround bold with custom
	css_illustration() - Add [Illustration: ...] markup
	css_sidenote() - Add [Sidenote: ...] markup
	css_custom_css()
	process_css() - process transformations
	
	when do we extract footnotes?
	
	convert to text
	
	perform operations on text:
	remove_nbspaces() - Remove non-breakable spaces between numbers
	remove_soft_hyphen() - Suppress shy (soft hyphen)

	   
General options:
	Ignore case when comparing
	Extract and process footnotes separately

Options for transforming an HTML file:
	add [Illustration ] tag
	add [Sidenote: ...]
	use greek transliteration in title attribute
	Suppress non-breakable spaces between numbers
	suppress zero width space (U+200b)
Options for transforming a text file:
	Suppress "[Footnote ?:" marks
	Suppress "[Illustration:" marks

If comparing with a file from the rounds
	In Px/Fx versions, remove [**proofreaders notes]
	In Px/Fx versions, regroup split wo-* *rds
	Silence formating differences
	Type of text cleaning:     best effort    none    proofers 
	

HTML5 tags:

ppcomp issue: lettersfromandoldtimesalesman.zip
The error is caused by lines 146, 150 and 156 in the source file. The file has <hr></hr>
instead of <hr/> and that causes the XML parser to fail. At this point I only know why it
fails. I don't know yet (1) how a user could detect that situation easily, or (2) what
could be changed in ppcomp to either identify it or live with it.

========================================
Changes: eliminate oe ligature transforms, treat same as ae.

Text file: use split list to strip boilerplate & find start line #, otherwise plain text.

html file: use split list to strip boilerplate & find start line #, need tree to process tags.
Then plain text can be used for char replacements.
