  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IN acceding to Mr Shipley’s request to write a book on Fossil Plants
    for the Cambridge Natural History Series, I am well aware that I have
    undertaken a work which was considered too serious a task by one who
    has been called a “founder of modern Palaeobotany.” I owe more than I
    am able to express to the friendship and guidance of the late Professor
    Williamson; and that I have attempted a work to which he consistently
    refused to commit himself, requires a word of explanation. My excuse
    must be that I have endeavoured to write a book which may render more
    accessible to students some of the important facts of Palaeobotany, and
    suggest lines of investigation in a subject which Williamson had so
    thoroughly at heart.</p>

  <p>The subject of Palaeobotany does not readily lend itself to adequate
    treatment in a work intended for both geological and botanical
    students. The Botanist and Geologist are not always acquainted
    with each other’s subject in a sufficient degree to appreciate the
    significance of Palaeobotany in its several points of contact with
    Geology and recent Botany. I have endeavoured to bear in mind the
    possibility that the following pages may be read by both non-geological
    and non-botanical students. It needs but a slight acquaintance with
    Geology for a Botanist to estimate the value of the most important
    applications of Palaeobotany; on the other hand, the bearing of fossil
    plants on the problems of phylogeny and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span> descent cannot be adequately
    understood without a fairly intimate knowledge of recent Botany.</p>

  <p>The student of elementary geology is not as a rule required to concern
    himself with vegetable palaeontology, beyond a general acquaintance
    with such facts as are to be found in geological text-books. The
    advanced student will necessarily find in these pages much with which
    he is already familiar; but this is to some extent unavoidable in a
    book which is written with the dual object of appealing to Botanists
    and Geologists. While considering those who may wish to extend their
    botanical or geological knowledge by an acquaintance with Palaeobotany,
    my aim has been to keep in view the requirements of the student who
    may be induced to approach the subject from the standpoint of an
    original investigator. As a possible assistance to those undertaking
    research in this promising field of work, I have given more references
    than may seem appropriate to an introductory treatise, and there are
    certain questions dealt with in greater detail than an elementary
    treatment of the subject requires. In several instances references
    are given in the text or in footnotes to specimens of Coal-Measure
    plants in the Williamson cabinet of microscopic sections. Now that this
    invaluable collection of slides has been acquired by the Trustees of
    the British Museum, the student of Palaeobotany has the opportunity of
    investigating for himself the histology of Palaeozoic plants.</p>

  <p>My plan has been to deal in some detail with certain selected types,
    and to refer briefly to such others as should be studied by anyone
    desirous of pursuing the subject more thoroughly, rather than to cover
    a wide range or to attempt to make the list of types complete. Of late
    years there has been a much wider interest evinced by Botanists in
    the study of fossil plants, and this is in great measure due to the
    valuable and able work of Graf zu Solms-Laubach. His <cite>Einleitung in
    die Palaeophytologie</cite> must long remain a constant book of reference
    for those engaged in palaeobotanical work. While referring to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span> authors
    who have advanced the study of petrified plants of the Coal period,
    one should not forget the valuable services that have been rendered by
    such men as Butterworth, Binns, Wilde, Earnshaw, Spencer, Nield, Lomax
    and Hemingway, by whose skill the specimens described by Williamson and
    others were first obtained and prepared for microscopical examination.</p>

  <p>I am indebted to many friends, both British and Continental, for help
    of various kinds. I would in the first place express my thanks to
    Professor T. McKenny Hughes for having originally persuaded me to begin
    the study of recent and fossil plants. I am indebted to Prof. Nathorst
    of Stockholm, Dr Hartz of Copenhagen, Prof. Zeiller, Dr Renault and
    Prof. Munier-Chalmas of Paris, Prof. Bertrand of Lille, Prof. Stenzel
    and the late Prof. Roemer of Breslau, Dr Sterzel of Chemnitz, the
    late Prof. Weiss of Berlin, the late Dr Stur of Vienna, and other
    continental workers, as well as to Mr Knowlton of Washington, for
    facilities afforded me in the examination of fossil plant collections.
    My thanks are due to the members of the Geological and Botanical
    departments of the British Museum; also to Mr E. T. Newton of the
    Geological Survey, and to those in charge of various provincial
    museums, for their never-failing kindness in offering me every
    assistance in the investigation of fossil plants under their charge.
    Prof. Marshall Ward has given me the benefit of his criticism on the
    section dealing with Fungi; and my friend Mr Alfred Harker has rendered
    me a similar service as regards the chapter on Geological History. I
    am especially grateful to my colleague, Mr Francis Darwin, for having
    read through the whole of the proofs of this volume. To Mr Shipley, as
    Editor, I am under a debt of obligation for suggestions and help in
    various forms. I would also express my sense of the unfailing courtesy
    and skill of the staff of the University Press.</p>

  <p>My friend Mr Kidston of Stirling has always generously responded to my
    requests for the loan of specimens from his private collection. Prof.
    Bayley Balfour of Edinburgh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span> Mr Wethered of Cheltenham and others have
    assisted me in a similar manner. I would also express my gratitude
    to Dr Hoyle of Manchester, Mr Platnauer of York, and Mr Rowntree of
    Scarborough for the loan of specimens.</p>

  <p>To Dr Henry Woodward of the British Museum I am indebted for the loan
    of the woodblocks made use of in figs. 10, 47, 60, 66, and 101, and to
    Messrs Macmillan for the process-block of fig. 25.</p>

  <p>For the photographs reproduced in figs. 15, 34, 68, 102 and 103 I owe
    an acknowledgment to Mr Edwin Wilson of Cambridge, and to my friend Mr
    C. A. Barber for the micro-photograph made use of in fig. 40.</p>

  <p>In conclusion I wish more particularly to thank my wife, who has drawn
    by far the greater number of the illustrations, and has in many other
    ways assisted me in the preparation of this Volume.</p>

  <p>In Volume II the Systematic treatment of Plants will be concluded,
    and the last chapters will be devoted to such subjects as geological
    floras, plants as rock-builders, fossil plants and evolution, and other
    general questions connected with Palaeobotany.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> scientific study of fossil plants dates from a comparatively recent
    period, and palaeobotany has only attained a real importance in the
    eyes of botanists and geologists during the last few decades of the
    present century. It would be out of place, in a short treatise like
    the present, to attempt a detailed historical sketch, or to give an
    adequate account of the gradual rise and development of this modern
    science. An excellent <cite>Sketch of Palaeobotany</cite> has recently been
    drawn up by Prof. Lester Ward<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, of the United States Geological
    Survey, and an earlier historical retrospect may be found in the
    introduction to an important work by an eminent German palaeobotanist,
    the late Prof. Göppert<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. In the well-known work by Parkinson
    on <cite>The Organic Remains of a Former World</cite><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> there is much
    interesting information as to the early history of our knowledge <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>of
    fossil plants, as well as a good exposition of the views held at the
    beginning of this century.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">FOSSIL PLANTS AND THE FLOOD.</div>

  <p>As a means of bringing into relief the modern development of the
    science of fossil plants, we may briefly pass in review some of the
    earlier writers, who have concerned themselves in a greater or less
    degree with a descriptive or speculative treatment of the records of a
    past vegetation. In the early part of the present century, and still
    more in the eighteenth century, the occurrence of fossil plants and
    animals in the earth’s crust formed the subject of animated, not to
    say acrimonious, discussion. The result was that many striking and
    ingenious theories were formulated as to the exact manner of formation
    of fossil remains, and the part played by the waters of the deluge in
    depositing fossiliferous strata. The earlier views on fossil vegetables
    are naturally bound up with the gradual evolution of geological
    science. It is from Italy that we seem to have the first glimmering
    of scientific views; but we are led to forget this early development
    of more than three hundred years ago, when we turn to the writings
    of English and other authors of the eighteenth century. “Under these
    white banks by the roadside,” as a writer on Verona has expressed it,
    “was born, like a poor Italian gipsy, the modern science of geology.”
    Early in the sixteenth century the genius of Leonardo da Vinci<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
    compelled him to adopt a reasonable explanation of the occurrence of
    fossil shells in rocks far above the present sea-level. Another Italian
    writer, Fracastaro, whose attention was directed to this matter by
    the discovery of numerous shells brought to light by excavations at
    Verona, expressed his belief in the organic nature of the remains, and
    went so far as to call in question the Mosaic deluge as a satisfactory
    explanation of the deposition of fossil-bearing strata.</p>

  <p>The partial recognition by some observers of the true nature of fossils
    marks the starting point of more rational views. The admission that
    fossils were not mere sports of nature, or the result of some wonderful
    ‘vis lapidifica,’ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>was naturally followed by numerous speculations as
    to the manner in which the remains of animals and plants came to be
    embedded in rocks above the sea-level. For a long time, the ‘universal
    flood’ was held responsible by nearly all writers for the existence
    of fossils in ancient sediments. Dr John Woodward, in his <cite>Essay
    toward a Natural History of the Earth</cite>, propounded the somewhat
    revolutionary theory, that “the whole terrestrial globe was taken all
    to pieces and dissolved at the Deluge, the particles of stone, marble,
    and all solid fossils dissevered, taken up into the water, and there
    sustained together with sea-shells and other animal and vegetable
    bodies: and that the present earth consists, and was formed out of that
    promiscuous mass of sand, earth, shells, and the rest falling down
    again, and subsiding from the water<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.” In common with other writers,
    he endeavoured to fix the exact date of the flood by means of fossil
    plants. Speaking of some hazel-nuts, which were found in a Cheshire
    moss pit, he draws attention to their unripened condition, and adds:
    “The deluge came forth at the end of May, when nuts are not ripe.” As
    additional evidence, he cites the occurrence of “Pine cones in their
    vernal state,” and of some Coal-Measure fossils which he compares with
    Virginian Maize, “tender, young, vernal, and not ripened<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.” Woodward
    (1665–1728) was Professor of Physic in Gresham College; he bequeathed
    his geological collections to the University of Cambridge, and founded
    the Chair which bears his name.</p>

  <p>Another writer, Mendes da Costa, in a paper in the <cite>Philosophical
    Transactions</cite> for 1758, speaks of the impressions of “ferns and
    reed-like plants” in the coal-beds, and describes some fossils
    (<i>Sigillaria</i> and <i>Stigmaria</i>) as probably unknown forms of
    plant life<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

  <p>Here we have the suggestion that in former ages there were plants
    which differed from those of the present age. Discussing the nature of
    some cones (<i>Lepidostrobi</i>) from the ironstone of Coalbrookdale
    in Shropshire, he concludes: “I firmly believe these bodies to be of
    vegetable origin, buried in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>strata of the Earth at the time of the
    universal deluge recorded by Moses.” Scheuchzer of Zurich, the author
    of one of the earliest works on fossil plants and a “great apostle
    of the Flood Theory,” figures and describes a specimen as an ear of
    corn, and refers to its size and general appearance as pointing to the
    month of May as the time of the deluge<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. Another English writer, Dr
    Parsons, in giving an account of the well-known ‘fossil fruits and
    other bodies found in the island of Sheppey,’ is disposed to dissent
    from Woodward’s views as to the time of the flood. He suggests that the
    fact of the Sheppey fruits being found in a perfectly ripe condition,
    points to the autumn as the more probable time for the occurrence of
    the deluge<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

  <p>In looking through the works of the older writers, and occasionally
    in the pages of latter-day contributors, we frequently find curiously
    shaped stones, mineral markings on rock surfaces, or certain fossil
    animals, described as fossil plants. In Plot’s <cite>Natural History of
    Oxfordshire</cite>, published in 1705, a peculiarly shaped stone, probably
    a flint, is spoken of as one of the ‘Fungi lethales non esculenti<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>’;
    and again a piece of coral<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is compared with a ‘Bryony root broken
    off transversely.’ On the other hand, that we may not undervalue
    the painstaking and laborious efforts of those who helped to lay
    the foundations of modern science, we may note that such authors as
    Scheuchzer and Woodward were not misled by the moss-like or dendritic
    markings of oxide of manganese on the surface of rocks, which are not
    infrequently seen to-day in the cabinets of amateurs as specimens of
    fossil plants.</p>

  <p>The oldest figures of fossil plants from English rocks which are drawn
    with any degree of accuracy are those of Coal-Measure ferns and other
    plants in an important work by Edward Lhwyd published at Oxford in
    1760<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>

  <p>Passing beyond these prescientific speculations, brief reference may
    be made to some of the more eminent pioneers of palaeobotany. The
    Englishman Artis<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> deserves mention for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>the quality rather than the
    quantity of his contributions to Palaeozoic botany; and among American
    authors Steinhauer’s<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> name must hold a prominent place in the list
    of those who helped to found this branch of palaeontology. Among
    German writers, Schlotheim stands out prominently as one who first
    published a work on fossil plants which still remains an important
    book of reference. Writing in 1804, he draws attention to the neglect
    of fossils from a scientific standpoint; they are simply looked upon,
    he says, as “unimpeachable documents of the flood<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.” His book
    contains excellent figures of many Coal-Measure plants, and we find in
    its pages occasional comparisons of fossil species with recent plants
    of tropical latitudes. Among the earlier authors whose writings soon
    become familiar to the student of fossil plants, reference must be
    made to Graf Sternberg, who was born three years before Schlotheim,
    but whose work came out some years later than that of the latter.
    His great contribution to Fossil Botany entitled <cite>Versuch einer
    geognostisch-botanischen Darstellung der Flora der Vorwelt</cite>, was
    published in several parts between the years 1820 and 1838; it was
    drawn up with the help of the botanist Presl, and included a valuable
    contribution by Corda<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. In addition to descriptions and numerous
    figures of plants from several geological horizons, this important work
    includes discussions on the formation of coal, with observations on the
    climates of past ages.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">STERNBERG AND BRONGNIART.</div>

  <p>Sternberg endeavoured to apply to fossil plants the same methods of
    treatment as those made use of in the case of recent species. About
    the same time as Sternberg’s earlier parts were published, Adolphe
    Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> of Paris began to enrich palaeobotanical science
    by those splendid researches which have won for him the title of
    the “Father of palaeobotany.” In Brongniart’s <cite>Prodrome</cite>, and
    <cite>Histoire des végétaux fossiles</cite>, and later in his <cite>Tableau
    des genres de végétaux fossiles</cite>, we have not merely careful
    descriptions and a systematic arrangement of the known species of
    fossil plants, but a masterly scientific <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>treatise on palaeobotany
    in its various aspects, which has to a large extent formed the
    model for the best subsequent works on similar lines. From the same
    author, at a later date, there is at least one contribution to
    fossil plant literature which must receive a passing notice even in
    this short sketch. In 1839 he published an exhaustive account of
    the minute structure of one of the well-known Palaeozoic genera,
    <i>Sigillaria</i>; this is not only one of the best of the earliest
    monographs on the histology of fossil species, but it is one of
    the few existing accounts of the internal structure of this common
    type<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. The fragment of a Sigillarian stem which formed the subject
    of Brongniart’s memoir is in the Natural History Museum in the Jardin
    des Plantes, Paris. It affords a striking example of the perfection of
    preservation as well as of the great beauty of the silicified specimens
    from Autun, in Central France. Brongniart was not only a remarkably
    gifted investigator, whose labours extend over a period connecting the
    older and more crude methods of descriptive treatment with the modern
    development of microscopic analysis, but he possessed the power of
    inspiring a younger generation with a determination to keep up the high
    standard of the palaeobotanical achievements of the French School. In
    some cases, indeed, his disciples have allowed a natural reverence for
    the Master to warp their scientific judgement, where our more complete
    knowledge has naturally led to the correction of some of Brongniart’s
    conclusions. Without attempting to follow the history of the science to
    more recent times, the names of Heer, Lesquereux, Zigno, Massalongo,
    Saporta and Ettingshausen should be included among those who rendered
    signal service to the science of fossil plants. The two Swiss writers,
    Heer<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and Lesquereux<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, contributed numerous books and papers
    on palaeobotanical subjects, the former being especially well known
    in connection with the fossil floras of Switzerland and of Arctic
    lands, and the latter for his valuable writings on the fossil plants
    of his adopted country, North America. Zigno<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and Massalongo<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
    performed like services for Italy, and the Marquis of Saporta’s name
    will <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>always hold an honourable and prominent position in the list of
    the pioneers of scientific palaeobotany; his work on the Tertiary and
    Mesozoic floras of France being specially noteworthy among the able
    investigations which we owe to his ability and enthusiasm<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. In Baron
    Ettingshausen<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> we have another representative of those students
    of ancient vegetation who have done so much towards establishing the
    science of fossil plants on a philosophical basis.</p>

  <p>As in other fields of Natural Science, so also in a marked degree in
    fossil botany, a new stimulus was given to scientific inquiry by the
    application of the microscope to palaeobotanical investigation. In
    1828 Sprengel published a work entitled <cite>Commentatio de Psarolithis,
    ligni fossilis genere</cite><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>; in which he dealt in some detail with
    the well-known silicified fern-stems of Palaeozoic age, from Saxony,
    basing his descriptions on the characteristics of anatomical structure
    revealed by microscopic examination.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF FOSSIL PLANTS.</div>

  <p>In 1833 Henry Witham of Lartington brought out a work on <cite>The
    Internal Structure of Fossil Vegetables</cite><a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; this book, following
    the much smaller and less important work by Sprengel, at once
    established palaeobotany on a firmer scientific basis, and formed the
    starting point for those more accurate methods of research, which have
    yielded such astonishing results in the hands of modern workers. In
    the introduction Witham writes, “My principal object in presenting
    this work to the public, is to impress upon geologists the advantage
    of attending more particularly to the intimate organization of fossil
    plants; and should I succeed in directing their efforts towards
    the elucidation of this obscure subject, I shall feel a degree of
    satisfaction which will amply repay my labour<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.”</p>

  <p>On another page he writes as follows,—“From investigations made by
    the most active and experienced botanical geologists, we find reason
    to conclude that the first appearance <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>of an extensive vegetation
    occurred in the Carboniferous series; and from a recent examination
    of the mountain-limestone groups and coal-fields of Scotland, and the
    north of England, we learn that these early vegetable productions, so
    far from being simple in their structure, as had been supposed, are
    as complicated as the phanerogamic plants of the present day. This
    discovery necessarily tends to destroy the once favourite idea, that,
    from the oldest to the most recent strata, there has been a progressive
    development of vegetable and animal forms, from the simplest to the
    most complex<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.” Since Witham’s day we have learnt much as to the
    morphology of Palaeozoic plants, and can well understand the opinions
    to which he thus gives expression.</p>

  <p>It would be difficult to overrate the immense importance of this
    publication from the point of view of modern palaeobotany.</p>

  <p>The art of making transparent sections of the tissues of fossil
    plants seems to have been first employed by Sanderson, a lapidary,
    and it was afterwards considerably improved by Nicol<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. This most
    important advance in methods of examination gave a new impetus to
    the subject, but it is somewhat remarkable that the possibilities of
    the microscopical investigation of fossil plants have been but very
    imperfectly realised by botanical workers until quite recent years. As
    regards such a flora as that of the Coal-Measures, we can endorse the
    opinion expressed at the beginning of the century in reference to the
    study of recent mosses—“Ohne das Göttergeschenk des zusammengesetzten
    Mikroskops ist auf diesem Felde durchaus keine Ernte<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.” A useful
    summary of the history of the study of internal structure is given
    by Knowlton in a memoir published in 1889<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. Not long after
    Witham’s book was issued there appeared a work of exceptional merit
    by Corda<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, in which numerous Palaeozoic plants are figured and
    fully described, mainly from the standpoint of internal structure.
    This author <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>lays special stress on the importance of studying the
    microscopical structure of fossil plants.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">ENGLISH PALAEOBOTANISTS.</div>

  <p>Without pausing to enumerate the contributions of such well-known
    continental authors as Göppert, Cotta, Schimper, Stenzel, Schenk and
    a host of others, we may glance for a moment at the services rendered
    by English investigators to the study of palaeobotanical histology.
    Unfortunately we cannot always extend our examination of fossil plants
    beyond the characters of external form and surface markings; but in
    a few districts there are preserved remnants of ancient floras in
    which fragments of stems, roots, leaves and other structures have been
    petrified in such a manner as to retain with wonderful completeness
    the minute structure of their internal tissues. During the deposition
    of the coal seams in parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire the conditions
    of fossilisation were exceptionally favourable, and thus English
    investigators have been fortunately placed for conducting researches on
    the minute anatomy of the Coal-Measure plants. The late Mr Binney of
    Manchester did excellent service by his work on the internal structure
    of some of the trees of the Coal Period forests. In his introductory
    remarks to a monograph on the genus <i>Calamites</i>, after speaking
    of the desirability of describing our English specimens, he goes on to
    say, “When this is done, we are likely to possess a literature on our
    Carboniferous fossils worthy of the first coal-producing country<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.”
    The continuation and extension of Binney’s work in the hands of
    Carruthers, Williamson, and others, whose botanical qualifications
    enabled them to produce work of greater scientific value, has gone far
    towards the fulfilment of Binney’s prophecy.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">DIFFICULTIES OF IDENTIFICATION.</div>

  <p>In dealing with the structure of Palaeozoic plants, we shall be
    under constant obligation to the splendid series of memoirs from
    the pen of Prof. Williamson<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. As the writer of a sympathetic
    obituary notice has well said: “In his fifty-fifth year he began
    the great series of memoirs which mark the culminating point of his
    scientific activity, and which will assure to him, for all time, in
    conjunction with Brongniart, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>honourable title of a founder of
    modern Palaeobotany<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.” If we look back through a few decades,
    and peruse the pages of Lindley and Hutton’s classic work<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> on
    the Fossil flora of Great Britain, a book which is indispensable
    to fossil botanists, and read the description of such a genus as
    <i>Sigillaria</i> or <i>Stigmaria</i>; or if we extend our retrospect
    to an earlier period and read Woodward’s description of an unusually
    good specimen of a <i>Lepidodendron</i>, and finally take stock of our
    present knowledge of such plants, we realise what enormous progress
    has been made in palaeobotanical studies. Lindley and Hutton, in the
    preface to the first volume of the Flora, claim to have demonstrated
    that both <i>Sigillaria</i> and <i>Stigmaria</i> were plants with
    “the highest degree of organization, such as <i>Cactaeae</i>, or
    <i>Euphorbiaceae</i>, or even <i>Asclepiadeae</i>”; Woodward describes
    his <i>Lepidodendron</i> (Fig. 1) as “an ironstone, black and flat,
    and wrought over one surface very finely, with a strange cancellated
    work<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.” Thanks largely to the work of Binney, Carruthers, Hooker,
    Williamson, and to the labours of continental botanists, we are at
    present almost as familiar with <i>Lepidodendron</i> and several
    other Coal-Measure <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>genera as with the structure of a recent forest
    tree. While emphasizing the value of the microscopic methods of
    investigation, we are not disposed to take such a hopeless view of
    the possibilities of the determination of fossil forms, in which no
    internal structure is preserved, as some writers have expressed. The
    preservation of minute structure is to be greatly desired from the
    point of view of the modern palaeobotanist, but he must recognise the
    necessity of making such use as he can of the numberless examples of
    plants of all ages, which occur only in the form of structureless casts
    or impressions.</p>

  <p>In looking through the writings of the earlier authors we cannot help
    noticing their anxiety to match all fossil plants with living species;
    but by degrees it was discovered that fossils are frequently the
    fragmentary samples of extinct types, which can be studied only under
    very unfavourable conditions. In the absence of those characters on
    which the student of living plants relies as guides to classification,
    it is usually impossible to arrive at any trustworthy conclusions as
    to precise botanical affinity. Brongniart and other authors recognised
    this fact, and instituted several convenient generic terms of a purely
    artificial and provisional nature, which are still in general use. The
    dangers and risks of error which necessarily attend our attempts to
    determine small and imperfect fragments of extinct species of plants,
    will be briefly touched on in another place.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the greater refinements and thoroughness of scientific methods
    and the enormous and ever-increasing mass of literature have inevitably
    led to extreme specialisation, it is more than ever important to look
    beyond the immediate limits of one’s own subject, and to note its
    points of contact with other lines of research. A palaeobotanist is
    primarily concerned with the determination and description of fossil
    plants, but he must at the same time constantly keep in view the
    bearing of his work on wider questions of botanical or geological
    importance. From the nature of the case, we have in due measure to
    adapt the methods of work to the particular conditions before us. It is
    impossible to follow in the case of all fossil species precisely the
    same treatment as with the more complete and perfect recent plants;
    but it is of the utmost importance for a student of palaeobotany, by
    adhering to the methods of recent botany, to preserve as far as he is
    able the continuity of the past and present floras. Palaeontological
    work has often been undertaken by men who are pure geologists, and
    whose knowledge of zoology or botany is of the most superficial
    character, with the result that biologists have not been able to avail
    themselves, to any considerable extent, of the records of extinct forms
    of life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> They find the literature is often characterised by a special
    palaeontological phraseology, and by particular methods of treatment,
    which are unknown to the student of living plants and animals. From
    this and other causes a purely artificial division has been made
    between the science of the organic world of to-day and that of the past.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">NEGLECT OF FOSSILS BY BOTANISTS.</div>

  <p>Fossils are naturally regarded by a stratigraphical geologist
    as records which enable him to determine the relative age of
    fossil-bearing rocks. For such a purpose it is superfluous to inquire
    into the questions of biological interest which centre round the
    relics of ancient floras. Primarily concerned, therefore, with fixing
    the age of strata, it is easy to understand how geologists have been
    content with a special kind of palaeontology which is out of touch
    with the methods of systematic zoology or botany. On the other hand,
    the botanist whose observations and researches have not extended
    beyond the limits of existing plants, sees in the vast majority of
    fossil forms merely imperfect specimens, which it is impossible to
    determine with any degree of scientific accuracy. He prefers to wait
    for perfect material; or in other words, he decides that fossils must
    be regarded as outside the range of taxonomic botany. It would seem,
    then, that the unsatisfactory treatment or comparative neglect of
    fossil plants, has been in a large measure due to the narrowness of
    view which too often characterises palaeobotanical literature. This
    has at once repelled those who have made a slight effort to recognise
    the subject, and has resulted in a one-sided and, from a biological
    standpoint, unscientific treatment of this branch of science. It must
    be admitted that palaeobotanists have frequently brought the subject
    into disrepute by their over-anxiety to institute specific names for
    fragments which it is quite impossible to identify. This over-eagerness
    to determine imperfect specimens, and the practice of drawing
    conclusions as to botanical affinity without any trustworthy evidence,
    have naturally given rise to considerable scepticism as to the value
    of palaeobotanical records. Another point, which will be dealt with
    at greater length in a later chapter, is that geologists have usually
    shown a distinct prejudice against fossil plants as indices of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
    geological age; this again, is no doubt to a large extent the result of
    imperfect and inaccurate methods of description, and of the neglect of
    and consequent imperfect acquaintance with fossil plants as compared
    with fossil animals.</p>

  <p>The student of fossil plants should endeavour to keep before him the
    fact that the chief object of his work is to deal with the available
    material in the most natural and scientific manner; and by adopting
    the methods of modern botany, he should always aim to follow such
    lines as may best preserve the continuity of past and present types
    of plants. Descriptions of floras of past ages and lists of fossil
    species, should be so compiled that they may serve the same purpose to
    a stratigraphical geologist, who is practically a geographer of former
    periods of the Earth’s history, as the accounts of existing floras
    to students of present day physiography. The effect of carrying out
    researches on some such lines as these, should be to render available
    to both botanists and geologists the results of the specialist’s work.</p>

  <p>In some cases, palaeobotanical investigations may be of the utmost
    service to botanical science, and of little or no value to geology. The
    discovery of a completely preserved gametophyte of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
    or <i>Calamites</i>, or of a petrified Moss plant in Palaeozoic rocks
    would appeal to most botanists as a matter of primary importance, but
    for the stratigraphical geologist such discoveries would possess but
    little value. On the other hand the discovery of some characteristic
    species of Coal-Measure plants from a deep boring through Mesozoic or
    Tertiary strata might be a matter of special geological importance,
    but to the botanist it would be of no scientific value. In very many
    instances, however, if the palaeobotanist follows such lines as
    have been briefly suggested, the results of his labours should be
    at once useful and readily accessible to botanists and geologists.
    As Humboldt has said in speaking of Palaeontology, “the analytical
    study of primitive animal and vegetable life has taken a double
    direction; the one is purely morphological, and embraces especially
    the natural history and physiology of organisms, filling up the chasms
    in the series of still living species by the fossil structures of the
    primitive world. The second is more specially geognostic, considering
    fossil remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> in their relations to the superposition and relative
    age of the sedimentary formations<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.”</p>

  <div class="sidenote">FOSSIL PLANTS AND DISTRIBUTION.</div>

  <p>To turn for a moment to some of the most obvious connections between
    palaeobotany and the wider sciences of botany and geology. The records
    of fossil species must occupy a prominent position in the data by
    which we may hope to solve some at least of the problems of plant
    evolution. From the point of view of distribution, palaeobotany is of
    considerable value, not only to the student of geographical botany,
    but to the geologist, who endeavours to map out the positions of
    ancient continents with the help of palaeontological evidence. The
    present distribution of plants and animals represents but one chapter
    in the history of life on the Earth; and to understand or appreciate
    the facts which it records, we have to look back through such pages
    as have been deciphered in the earlier chapters of the volume. The
    distribution of fossil plants lies at the foundation of the principles
    of the present grouping of floras on the Earth’s surface. Those who
    have confined their study of distribution to the plant geography of
    the present age, must supplement their investigations by reference to
    the work of palaeobotanical writers. If the lists of plant species
    drawn up by specialists in fossil botany, have been prepared with
    a due sense of the important conclusions which botanists may draw
    from them from the standpoint of distribution, they will be readily
    accepted as sound links in the chain of evidence. Unfortunately,
    however, if many of the lists of ancient floras were made use of in
    such investigations, the conclusions arrived at would frequently be of
    little value on account of the untrustworthy determinations of many
    of the species. In the case of particular genera the study of the
    distribution of the former species both in time and space, that is
    geologically and geographically, points to rational explanations of,
    or gives added significance to, the facts of present day distribution.
    That isolated conifer, <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> L. now restricted to Japan
    and China, was in former times abundant in Europe and in other parts
    of the world. It is clearly an exceedingly ancient type, isolated not
    only in geographical distribution but in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>botanical affinities, which
    has reached the last stage in its natural life. The Mammoth trees of
    California (<i>Sequoia sempervirens</i> Endl., and <i>S. gigantea</i>
    Lindl. and Gord.) afford other examples of a parallel case. The Tulip
    tree of North America and China and other allied forms are fairly common in the
    Tertiary plant beds of Europe, but the living representatives are now
    exclusively North American. Such differences in distribution as are
    illustrated by these dicotyledonous forest trees in Tertiary times and
    at the present day, have been clearly explained with the help of the
    geological record. Forbes, Darwin, Asa Gray<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and others have been
    able to explain many apparent anomalies in the distribution of existing
    plants, and to reconcile the differences between the past and present
    distribution of many genera by taking account of the effect on plant
    life of the glacial period. As the ice gradually crept down from the
    polar regions and spread over the northern parts of Europe, many plants
    were driven further south in search of the necessary warmth. In the
    American continent such migration was rendered possible by the southern
    land extension; in Europe on the other hand the southerly retreat was
    cut off by impassable barriers, and the extinction of several genera
    was the natural result.</p>

  <p>The comparatively abundant information which we possess as to the
    past vegetation of polar regions and the value of such knowledge to
    geologists and botanists alike is in striking contrast to the absence
    of similar data as regards Antarctic fossils. Darwin in an exceedingly
    interesting letter to Hooker <i lang="fr">à propos</i> of a forthcoming British
    Association address, referring to this subject writes as follows:—</p>

  <p>“The extreme importance of the Arctic fossil plants is self-evident.
    Take the opportunity of groaning over our ignorance of the Lignite
    plants of Kerguelen Land, or any Antarctic land. It might do good<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.”</p>

  <p>In working out any collection of fossil plants, it would be well,
    therefore, to bear in mind that our aim should be rather to reproduce
    an accurate fragment of botanical history, than to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>perform feats of
    determination with hopelessly inadequate specimens. Had this principle
    been generally followed, the number of fossil plant species would be
    enormously reduced, but the value of the records would be considerably
    raised.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">FOSSIL PLANTS AND CLIMATE.</div>

  <p>Our knowledge of plant anatomy, and of those laws of growth which
    govern certain classes of plants to-day and in past time, has been very
    materially widened and extended by the facts revealed to us by the
    detailed study of Coal-Measure species. The modern science of Plant
    Biology, refounded by Charles Darwin, has thrown considerable light
    on the laws of plant life, and it enables us to correlate structural
    characteristics with physiological conditions of growth. Applying the
    knowledge gained from living plants to the study of such extinct types
    as permit of close microscopic examination, we may obtain a glimpse
    into the secrets of the botanical binomics of Palaeozoic times. The
    wider questions of climatic conditions depend very largely upon the
    evidence of fossil botany for a rational solution. As an instance
    of the best authenticated and most striking alternation in climatic
    conditions in comparatively recent times, we may cite the glacial
    period or Ice-Age. The existence of Arctic conditions has been proved
    by purely geological evidence, but it receives additional confirmation,
    and derives a wider importance from the testimony of fossil plants. In
    rocks deposited before the spread of ice from high northern latitudes,
    we find indubitable proofs of a widely distributed subtropical flora in
    Central and Northern Europe. Passing from these rocks to more recent
    beds there are found indications of a fall in temperature, and such
    northern plants as the dwarf Birch, the Arctic Willow and others reveal
    the southern extension of Arctic cold to our own latitudes.</p>

  <p>The distribution of plants in time, that is the range of classes,
    families, genera and species of plants through the series of strata
    which make up the crust of the earth, is a matter of primary importance
    from a botanical as well as from a geological point of view.</p>

  <p>Among the earlier writers, Brongniart recognised the marked differences
    between the earlier and later floras, and attempted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> to correlate
    the periods of maximum development of certain classes of plants
    with definite epochs of geological history. He gives the following
    classification in which are represented the general outlines of plant
    development from Palaeozoic to Tertiary times<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

  <p>Since Brongniart’s time this method of classification has been
    extended to many of the smaller subdivisions of the geological epochs,
    and species of fossil plants are often of the greatest value in
    questions of correlation. In recent years the systematic treatment
    of Coal-Measure and other plants in the hands of various Continental
    and English writers has clearly demonstrated their capabilities
    for the purpose of subdividing a series of strata into stages and
    zones<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. The more complete becomes our knowledge of any flora, the
    greater possibility there is of making use of the plants as indices of
    geological age<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">FOSSIL PLANTS AND PHYLOGENY.</div>

  <p>Not only is it possible to derive valuable aid in the correlation of
    strata from the facts of plant distribution, but we may often follow
    the various stages in the history of a particular genus as we trace
    the records of its occurrence through the geologic series. In studying
    the march of plant life through past ages, the botanist may sometimes
    follow the progress of a genus from its first appearance, through the
    time of maximum development, to its decline or extinction. In the
    Palaeozoic forests there was perhaps no more conspicuous or common
    tree than the genus long known under the name of <i>Calamites</i>.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>This plant attained a height of fifty or a hundred feet, with a
    proportionate girth, and increased in thickness in a manner precisely
    similar to that in which our forest trees grow in diameter. The
    exceptionally favourable conditions under which specimens of calamitean
    plants have been preserved, have enabled us to become almost as
    familiar with the minute structure of their stems and roots, as well as
    with their spore-producing organs, as with those of a living species.
    In short, it is thoroughly established that <i>Calamites</i> agrees in
    most essential respects with our well known <i>Equisetum</i>, and must
    be included in the same order, or at least sub-class, as the recent
    genus of <i>Equisetaceae</i>. As we ascend the geologic series from
    the Coal-Measures, a marked numerical decline of <i>Calamites</i> is
    obvious in the Permian period, and in the red sandstones of the Vosges,
    which belong to the same series of rocks as the Triassic strata of
    the Cheshire plain, the true <i>Calamites</i> is replaced by a large
    <i>Equisetum</i> apparently identical in external appearance and habit
    of growth with the species living to-day. In the more recent strata the
    Horse-tails are still represented, but the size of the Tertiary species
    agrees more closely with the comparatively small forms which have such
    a wide geographical distribution at the present time. Thus we are able
    to trace out the history of a recent genus of Vascular Cryptogams,
    and to follow a particular type of organisation from the time of its
    maximum development, through its gradual transition to those structural
    characters which are represented in the living descendants of the
    arborescent Calamites of the coal-period forests. The pages of such a
    history are frequently imperfect and occasionally missing, but others,
    again, are written in characters as clear as those which we decipher by
    a microscopical examination of the tissues of a recent plant.</p>

  <p>As one of the most striking instances in which the microscopic study
    of fossil plants has shown the way to a satisfactory solution of
    the problems of development, we may mention such extinct genera as
    <i>Lyginodendron</i>, <i>Myeloxylon</i> and others. Each of these
    genera will be dealt with at some length in the systematic part of the
    book, and we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> afterwards discuss the importance of such types,
    from the point of view of plant evolution.</p>

  <p>The botanist who would trace out the phylogeny of any existing class or
    family, makes it his chief aim to discover points of contact between
    the particular type of structure which he is investigating, and that of
    other more or less closely related classes or families.</p>

  <p>Confining himself to recent forms, he may discover, here and there,
    certain anatomical or embryological facts, which suggest promising
    lines of inquiry in the quest after such affinities as point to a
    common descent. Without recourse to the evidence afforded by the plants
    of past ages, we must always admit that our existing classification
    of the vegetable kingdom is an expression of real gaps which separate
    the several classes of plants from one another. On the other hand our
    recently acquired and more accurate knowledge of such genera as have
    been alluded to, has made us acquainted with types of plant structure
    which enable us to fill in some of the lacunae in our existing
    classification. In certain instances we find merged in a single species
    morphological characteristics which, in the case of recent plants, are
    regarded as distinctive features of different subdivisions. It has been
    clearly demonstrated that in <i>Lyginodendron</i>, we have anatomical
    peculiarities typical of recent cycads, combined with structural
    characteristics always associated with existing ferns. In rare cases,
    it happens that the remarkably perfect fossilisation of the tissues of
    fossil plants, enables us not only to give a complete description of
    the histology of extinct forms, but also to speak with confidence as to
    some of those physiological processes which governed their life.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">GEOLOGICAL HISTORY.</div>

  <p>So far, palaeobotany has been considered in its bearings on the
    study of recent plants. From a geological point of view the records
    of ancient floras have scarcely less importance. In recent years,
    facts have been brought to light, which show that plants have played
    a more conspicuous part than has usually been supposed as agents of
    rock-building. As tests of geologic age, there are good grounds for
    believing that the inferiority of plants to animals is more apparent
    than real.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> This question, however, must be discussed at greater length
    in a later chapter.</p>

  <p>Enough has been said to show the many-sided nature of the science of
    Fossil Plants, and the wide range of the problems which the geologist
    or botanist may reasonably expect to solve, by means of trustworthy
    data afforded by scientific palaeobotanical methods.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> attempting to sketch in briefest outline the geological history
    of the Earth, the most important object to keep in view is that of
    reproducing as far as possible the broad features of the successive
    stages in the building of the Earth’s crust. It is obviously
    impossible to go into any details of description, or to closely
    follow the evolution of the present continents; at most, we can only
    refer to such facts as may serve as an introduction of the elements
    of stratigraphical geology to non-geological readers. For a fuller
    treatment of the subject reference must be made to special treatises on
    geology.</p>

  <p>For the sake of convenience, it is customary in stratigraphical geology
    as also in biology, to make use of our imperfect knowledge as an aid
    to classification. If we possessed complete records of the Earth’s
    history, we should have an unbroken sequence, not merely of the various
    forms of life that ever existed, but of the different kinds of rocks
    formed in the successive ages of past time. As gaps exist in the chain
    of life, so also do we find considerable breaks in the sequence of
    strata which have been formed since the beginning of geologic time. The
    danger as well as the convenience of artificial classification must be
    kept in view. This has been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>well expressed by Freeman, in speaking of
    architectural styles,—“Our minds,” he says, “are more used to definite
    periods; they neglect or forget transitions which do indeed exist<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.”
    The idea of definite classification is liable to narrow our view of
    uniformity and the natural sequence of events.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">ROCK-BUILDING.</div>

  <p>Composing that part of the earth which is accessible to us,—or as it is
    generally called the earth’s crust,—there are rocks of various kinds,
    of which some have been formed by igneous agency, either as lavas or
    beds of ashes, or in the form of molten magmas which gradually cooled
    and became crystalline below a mass of superincumbent strata. With
    these rocks we need not concern ourselves.</p>

  <p>A large portion of the earth’s crust consists of such materials as
    sandstones, limestones, shales, and similar strata which have been
    formed in precisely the same manner as deposits are being accumulated
    at the present day. The whole surface of the earth is continually
    exposed to the action of destructive agencies, and suffers perpetual
    decay; it is the products of this ceaseless wear and tear that form the
    building materials of new deposits.</p>

  <p>The operation of water in its various forms, of wind, changes of
    temperature, and other agents of destruction cannot be fully dealt with
    in this short summary.</p>

  <p>A river flowing to the sea or emptying itself into an inland lake,
    carries its burden of gravel, sand, and mud, and sooner or later, as
    the rate of flow slackens, it deposits the materials in the river-bed
    or on the floor of the sea or lake.</p>

  <p>Fragments of rock, chipped off by wedges of ice, or detached in other
    ways from the parent mass, find their way to the mountain streams,
    and if not too heavy are conveyed to the main river, where the larger
    pieces come to rest as more or less rounded pebbles. Such water-worn
    rocks accumulate in the quieter reaches of a swiftly flowing river,
    or are thrown down at the head of the river’s delta. If such a
    deposit of loose water-worn material became cemented together either
    by the consolidating action of some solution percolating through the
    general mass, or by the pressure of overlying <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>deposits, there would
    be formed a hard rock made up of rounded fragments of various kinds
    of strata derived from different sources. Such a rock is known as a
    <span class="smcap">Conglomerate</span>. The same kind of rock may be formed equally well
    by the action of the sea; an old sea-beach with the pebbles embedded in
    a cementing matrix affords a typical example of a coarse conglomerate.
    Plant remains are occasionally met with in conglomerates, but usually
    in a fragmentary condition.</p>

  <p>From a conglomerate composed of large water-worn pebbles, to a fine
    homogeneous sandstone there are numerous intermediate stages. A body
    of water, with a velocity too small to carry along pebbles of rock in
    suspension or to roll them along the bed of the channel, is still able
    to transport the finer fragments or grains of sand, but as a further
    decrease in the velocity occurs, these are eventually deposited as beds
    of coarse or fine sand. The stretches of sand on a gradually shelving
    sea shore, or the deposits of the same material in a river’s delta,
    have been formed by the gradual wearing away and disintegration of
    various rocks, the detritus of which has been spread out in more or
    less regular beds on the floor of a lake or sea. Such accumulations
    of fine detrital material, if compacted or cemented together, become
    typical <span class="smcap">Sandstones</span>.</p>

  <p>In tracing beds of sandstone across a tract of country, it is
    frequently found that the character of the strata gradually alters;
    mud or clay becomes associated with the sandy deposit, until finally
    the sandstone is replaced by beds of dark coloured shale. Similarly
    the sandy detritus on the ocean floor, or in an inland lake, when
    followed further and further from the source from which the materials
    were derived, passes by degrees into argillaceous sand, and finally
    into sheets of dark clay or mud. The hardened beds of clay or fine
    grained mud become transformed into <span class="smcap">Shales</span>. As a general
    rule, then, shales are rocks which have been laid down in places
    further from the land, or at a greater distance from the source of
    origin of the detrital material, than sandstones or conglomerates.
    The conglomerates, or old shingle beaches, usually occur in somewhat
    irregular patches, marking old shore-lines or the head of a river
    delta. Coarse sandstones, or grits, may occur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> in the form of regularly
    bedded strata stretching over a wide area; and shales or clays may be
    followed through a considerable extent of country. The finer material
    composing the clays and shales has been held longer in suspension and
    deposited in deeper water in widespread and fairly horizontal layers.</p>

  <p>In some districts sandstones occur in which the individual grains
    show a well marked rounding of the angles, and in which fossils
    are extremely rare or entirely absent. The close resemblance of
    such deposits to modern desert sands suggests a similar method of
    formation; and there can be no doubt that in some instances there have
    been preserved the wind-worn desert sands of former ages. Aeolian
    or wind-formed accumulations, although by no means common, are of
    sufficient importance to be mentioned as illustrating a certain type of
    rock.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">CALCAREOUS ROCKS.</div>

  <p>The thick masses of limestone which form so prominent a feature in
    parts of England and Ireland, have been formed in a manner different
    from that to which sandstones and shales owe their origin. On the floor
    of a clear sea, too far from land to receive any water-borne sediment,
    there is usually in process of formation a mass of calcareous material,
    which in a later age may rise above the surface of the water as chalk
    or <span class="allsmcap">LIMESTONE</span>. Those organisms living in the sea, which are
    enclosed either wholly or in part by calcareous shells, are agents of
    limestone-building; their shells constantly accumulating on the floor
    of the sea give rise in course of time to a thick mass of sediment,
    composed in great part of carbonate of lime. Some of the shells in
    such a deposit may retain their original form, the calcareous body
    may on the other hand be broken up into minute fragments which are
    still recognisable with the help of a microscope, or the shells and
    other hard parts may be dissolved or disintegrated beyond recognition,
    leaving nothing in the calcareous sediment to indicate its method of
    formation.</p>

  <p>Not a few limestones consist in part of fossil corals, and owe their
    origin to colonies of coral polyps which built up reefs or banks of
    coral in the ancient seas.</p>

  <p>In the white cliffs of Dover, Flamborough Head and other places, we
    have a somewhat different form of calcareous rock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> which in part
    consists of millions of minute shells of Foraminifera, in part of
    broken fragments of larger shells of extinct molluscs, and to some
    extent of the remains of siliceous sponges. As a general rule,
    limestones and chalk rocks are ancient sediments, formed in clear and
    comparatively deep water, composed in the main of carbonate of lime,
    in some cases with a certain amount of carbonate of magnesium, and
    occasionally with a considerable admixture of silica.</p>

  <p>In such rocks land-plants must necessarily be rare. There are, however,
    limestones which wholly or in part owe their formation to masses of
    calcareous algae, which grew in the form of submarine banks or on coral
    reefs. Occasionally the remains of these algae are clearly preserved,
    but frequently all signs of plant structure have been completely
    obliterated. Again, there occur limestone rocks formed by chemical
    means, and in a manner similar to that in which beds of travertine are
    now being accumulated.</p>

  <p>Granites, basalts, volcanic lavas, tuffs, and other igneous rocks
    need not claim our attention, except in such cases as permit of plant
    remains being found in association with these materials. Showers of
    ashes blown from a volcano, may fall on the surface of a lake or sea
    and become mixed with sand and mud of subaerial origin. Streams of lava
    occasionally flow into water, or they may be poured from submarine
    vents, and so spread out on the ocean bed with strata of sand or clay.</p>

  <p>Passing from the nature and mode of origin of the sedimentary strata to
    the manner of their arrangement in the Earth’s crust, we must endeavour
    to sketch in the merest outline the methods of stratigraphical geology.
    The surface of the Earth in some places stands out in the form of bare
    masses of rock, roughly hewn or finely carved by Nature’s tools of
    frost, rain or running water; in other places we have gently undulating
    ground with beds of rock exposed to view here and there, but for the
    most part covered with loose material such as gravel, sands, boulder
    clay and surface soil.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">GEOLOGICAL SECTIONS.</div>

  <p>In the flat lands of the fen districts, the peat beds and low-lying
    salt marshes form the surface features, and are the connecting links
    between the rock-building now in progress and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> the deposits of an
    earlier age. If we could remove all these surface accumulations of
    sand, gravel, peat and surface soil, and take a bird’s eye view of
    the bare surface of the rocky skeleton of the earth’s crust, we
    should have spread before us the outlines of a geological map. In
    some places fairly horizontal beds of rock stretching over a wide
    extent of country, in another the upturned edges of almost vertical
    strata form the surface features; or, again, irregular bosses of
    crystalline igneous rock occur here and there as patches in the
    midst of bedded sedimentary or volcanic strata. A map showing the
    boundaries and distribution of the rocks as seen at the surface, tells
    us comparatively little as to the relative positions of the different
    rocks below ground, or of the relative ages of the several strata. If
    we supplement this superficial view by an inspection of the position
    of the strata as shown on the walls of a deep trench cut across the
    country, we at once gain very important information as to the relative
    position of the beds below the earth’s surface. The face of a quarry,
    the side of a river bed or a railway cutting, afford <span class="allsmcap">HORIZONTAL
    SECTIONS</span> or <span class="allsmcap">PROFILES</span> which show whether certain strata
    lie above or below others, whether a series of rocks consists of
    parallel and regularly stratified beds, or whether the succession of
    the strata is interfered with by a greater or less divergence from a
    parallel arrangement. If, for example, a section shows comparatively
    horizontal strata lying across the worn down edges of a series of
    vertical sedimentary rocks, we may fairly assume that some such changes
    as the following have taken place in that particular area.</p>

  <p>The underlying beds were originally laid down as more or less
    horizontal deposits; these were gradually hardened and compacted,
    then elevated above sea-level by a folding of the earth’s crust; the
    crests of the folds were afterwards worn down by denudation, and the
    eroded surface finally subsided below sea-level and formed the floor
    on which newer deposits were built up. Such breaks in the continuity
    of stratified deposits are known as <span class="allsmcap">UNCONFORMITIES</span>; in the
    interval of time which they represent great changes took place of which
    the records are either entirely lost, or have to be sought elsewhere.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

  <p>In certain more exceptional cases, it is possible to obtain what is
    technically known as a <span class="allsmcap">VERTICAL SECTION</span>; for example if a deep
    boring is sunk through a series of rocks, and the core of the boring
    examined, we have as it were a sample of the earth’s crust which may
    often teach us valuable lessons which cannot be learnt from maps or
    horizontal sections.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">INVERSION OF STRATA.</div>

  <p>It is obvious, that in a given series of beds, which are either
    horizontal or more or less obliquely inclined, the underlying strata
    were the first formed, and the upper beds were laid down afterwards.
    If, however, we trusted solely to the order of superposition in
    estimating relative age, our conclusions would sometimes be very far
    from the truth. Recent geological investigations have brought to
    light facts well nigh incredible as to the magnitude and extent of
    rock-foldings. In regions of great earth-movements, the crust has been
    broken along certain lines, and great masses of strata have been thrust
    for miles along the tops of newer rocks. Thus it may be brought about
    that the natural sequence of a set of beds has been entirely altered,
    and older rocks have come to overlie sediments of a later geological
    age. Facts such as these clearly illustrate the difficulties of correct
    geological interpretation.</p>

  <p>In the horizontal section (Fig. 2), from the summit of Büzistock on
    the left to Saasterg on the right, we have a striking case of intense
    rock-folding and dislocation<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. Prof. Heim<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> of Geneva has given
    numerous illustrations of the almost incredible positions assumed
    in the Swiss Mountains by vast thicknesses of rocks, and in the
    accompanying section taken from a recent work by Rothpletz we have a
    compact example of the possibilities of earth-movements as an agent of
    rock-folding. The section illustrates very clearly an exception to the
    rule that the order of superposition of a set of beds indicates the
    relative age of the strata. The horizontal line at the base is drawn at
    a height of 1650 metres above sea-level, and the summit of Büzistock
    reaches a height of 2340 m. The youngest rocks seen in the diagram are
    the Eocene beds <i>e</i>, at the base and as small isolated patches on
    the right-hand end of the section; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>the main mass of material composing
    the higher ground has been bodily thrust over the Eocene rocks, and in
    this process some of the beds, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, have been folded
    repeatedly on themselves. Similar instances of the overthrusting of a
    considerable thickness of strata have been described in the North-west
    Highlands of Scotland<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and elsewhere in the British Isles. It is
    important therefore to draw attention to cases of extreme <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>folding, as
    such phenomena are by no means exceptional in many parts of the world.</p>

  <p>The order of superposition of strata has afforded the key to our
    knowledge of the succession of life in geologic time, and the
    refinements of the stratigraphical correlation of sedimentary rocks
    are based on the comparison of their fossil contents. By a careful
    examination of the relics of fossil organisms obtained from rocks
    of all ages and countries, it has been found possible to restore in
    broken outline the past history of the Earth. By means, then, of
    stratigraphical and palaeontological evidence, a classification of the
    various rocks has been established, the lines of division being drawn
    in such places as represent gaps in the fossil records, or striking and
    widespread unconformities between different series of deposits.</p>

  <p>It is only in a few regions that we find rocks which can reasonably be
    regarded as the foundation stones of the Earth. As the globe gradually
    cooled, and its molten mass became skinned over with a solid crust,
    crystalline rocks must have been produced before the dawn of life, and
    before water could remain in a liquid form on the rocky surface. As
    soon as the temperature became sufficiently low, running water and rain
    began the work of denudation and rock disintegration which has been
    ceaselessly carried on ever since. In this continual breaking down and
    building up of the Earth’s surface, it would be no wonder if but few
    remnants were left of the first formed sediments of the earliest age.</p>

  <p>The action of heat, pressure and chemical change accompanying
    rock-foldings and crust-wrinklings, often so far alters sedimentary
    deposits, that their original form is entirely lost, and sandstone,
    shales and limestones become metamorphosed into crystalline quartzites,
    slates and marbles.</p>

  <p>The operation of metamorphism is therefore another serious difficulty
    in the way of recognising the oldest rocks. The earliest animals and
    plants which have been discovered are not such as we should expect
    to find as examples of the first products of organic life. Below the
    oldest known fossiliferous rocks, there must have been thousands of
    feet of sedimentary material, which has either been altered beyond
    recognition, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> from some cause or other does not form part of our
    present geological record.</p>

  <p>As a general introduction to geological chronology, a short summary
    may be given of the different formations or groups of strata, to which
    certain names have been assigned to serve as convenient designations
    for succeeding epochs in the world’s evolution. The following table
    (Fig. 3, pp. 32, 33) represents the geological series in a convenient
    form; the most characteristic rocks of each period are indicated by the
    usual conventional shading, and the most important breaks or lacunae in
    the records are shown by gaps and uneven lines. The relative thickness
    of the rocks of each period is approximately shown; but the vertical
    extent of the oldest or Archaean rocks as shown in Fig. 3 represents
    what is without doubt but a fraction of their proportional thickness.
    This table is taken, with certain alterations, from a paper by Prof.
    T. McKenny Hughes in the Cambridge Philosophical Proceedings for 1879.
    Speaking of the graphic method of showing the geological series, the
    author of the paper says, “It is convenient to have a table of the
    known strata, and although we cannot arrange all the rocks of the world
    in parallel columns, and say that <i>ABC</i> of one area are exactly
    synchronous with <i>A′B′C′</i> of another, still if we take any one
    country and establish a grouping for it, we find so many horizons at
    which equivalent formations can be identified in distant places, that
    we generally make an approximation to <span class="allsmcap">HOMOTAXIS</span> as Huxley
    called it. The most convenient grouping is obviously to bracket
    together locally continuous deposits, <i>i.e.</i> all the sediment
    which was formed from the time when the land went down and accumulation
    began, to the time when the sea bottom was raised and the work of
    destruction began. In the accompanying table I have given the rocks
    of Great Britain classified on this system, and bearing in mind that
    waste in one place must be represented by deposit elsewhere, I have
    represented the periods of degradation by intervals estimated where
    possible by the amount of denudation known to have taken place between
    the periods of deposition in the same district<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.”</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>There is perhaps no problem at once so difficult and so full of
    interest to the student of the Earth’s history, as the interpretation
    of the fragmentary records of the opening stages in geological and
    organic evolution. In tracing the growth and development of the human
    race, it becomes increasingly difficult to discover and decipher
    written documents as we penetrate farther back towards the beginning
    of the historical period; the records are usually incomplete and
    fragmentary, or rendered illegible by the superposed writings of a
    later date. So in the records of the rocks, as we pass beyond the
    oldest strata in which clearly preserved fossils are met with, we come
    to older rocks which afford either no data as to the period in which
    they were formed, or like the palimpsest, with its original characters
    almost obliterated by a late MS., the older portions of the Earth’s
    crust have been used and re-used in the rock-building of later ages.
    In the first place, it is exceedingly difficult to determine with any
    certainty what rocks may be regarded as trustworthy fragments of a
    primaeval land. Throughout the geological eras the Earth’s surface
    has been subjected to foldings and wrinklings, volcanic activity has
    been almost unceasing, and there is abundant evidence to show how
    the original characters of both igneous and sedimentary rocks may be
    entirely effaced by the operation of chemical and physical forces. It
    was formerly held that coarsely crystalline rocks such as granite are
    the oldest portions of the crust, but modern geology has conclusively
    proved that many of the so-called fundamental masses of rock are merely
    piles of ancient sediments which have been subjected to the repeated
    operation of powerful physical and chemical forces, and have undergone
    a complete rearrangement of their substance. As the result of more
    detailed investigations, many regions formerly supposed to consist of
    the foundation stones of the Earth’s crust, are now known to have been
    centres of volcanic disturbance and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> widespread metamorphism, and to be
    made up of post-archaean rocks.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">THE OLDEST ROCKS.</div>

  <p>The first formed rocks no doubt became at once the prey of denudation
    and disintegration, and on their surface would be accumulated the
    products of their own destruction: newer strata would entirely cover up
    portions of the original land, to be in their turn succeeded by still
    later deposits. There is reason to believe that in the remotest ages of
    the Earth’s history, the forces of denudation and igneous activity were
    more potent than in later times, and thus the oldest rocks could hardly
    retain their original structure through the long ages of geologic time.
    The earliest representatives of organic life were doubtless of such
    a perishable nature that their remains could not be preserved in a
    fossil state even under the most favourable conditions. Such organisms,
    whether plants or animals, as possessed any resistant tissues or hard
    skeletons might be preserved in the oldest rocks, but as these strata
    became involved in earth-foldings or were penetrated by injections of
    igneous eruptions, the relics of life would be entirely destroyed.
    It is, in short, practically hopeless to look for any fragments of
    the primitive crust except such as have undergone very considerable
    metamorphism, and equally futile to search for any recognisable remains
    of primitive life.</p>

  <p>In many parts of the world vast thicknesses of rock occur below the
    oldest known fossiliferous strata; these consist largely of laminated
    crystalline masses composed of quartz, felspar, and other minerals,
    having in fact the same composition as granite, but differing in the
    regular arrangement of the constituent parts. To such rocks the terms
    gneiss and schist have been applied. Rocks of this kind are by no means
    always of Archaean age, but many of the earliest known rocks consist of
    gneisses of various kinds, associated with altered lavas, metamorphosed
    ashes, breccias and other products of volcanic activity; with these
    there may be limestones, shales, sandstones, and other strata more or
    less closely resembling sedimentary deposits. Such a succession of
    gneissic rocks has been described as occupying a wide area in the basin
    of the St Lawrence river, and to these enormously thick and widespread
    masses a late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> Director of the Canadian Geological Survey applied
    the term Laurentian. These Laurentian rocks, with similar strata in
    Scandinavia, the north-west Highlands of Scotland, in certain parts of
    such mountain ranges as the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, Himalayas,
    Andes, Atlas, &amp;c., have been classed together as members of the oldest
    geological period, and are usually referred to under the name of
    Archaean, or less frequently Azoic rocks. In some of the uppermost
    Archaean rocks there have been recently discovered a few undoubted
    traces of fossil animals, but with this exception no fossils are known
    throughout the great mass of Archaean strata. It is true that some
    authorities regard the beds of graphite and other rocks as a proof of
    the abundance of plant life, but this supposition is not supported by
    any convincing evidence.</p>

  <p>The term Azoic<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> applied by some writers to these oldest rocks
    suggests the absence of life during the period in which they were
    formed. Life there must have been, though we are unable to discover its
    records. The period of time represented by the Archaean or Pre-Cambrian
    rocks must be enormous, and it was in that earliest era that the first
    links in the chain of life were forged.</p>

  <h5 id="II_Cambrian">II.&#160; <b>Cambrian.</b></h5>

  <p>The term Cambrian was adopted by Sedgwick for a series of sedimentary
    rocks in North Wales (<em>Cambria</em>). In that district, in South
    Wales, the Longmynd Hills, the Malverns, in Scotland, and other regions
    there occur more or less highly folded and contorted beds of pebbly
    conglomerate, sandstones, shales and slates resting on the uneven
    surface of an Archaean foundation.</p>

  <p>It is in these Cambrian rocks that trustworthy records of organic life
    are first met with. Among the most constant and characteristic fossils
    of this period are the extinct and aberrant members of the crustacea,
    the trilobites; these with some brachiopods, sponges, and other fossils
    comprise the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>oldest fauna, of which the ancestral types have yet to
    be discovered. During the last few decades the number of Cambrian
    fossils has been considerably increased, and in certain regions of
    North America and China there are found many thousand feet of strata
    above the typical Archaean rocks and below the newer fossiliferous beds
    of Cambrian age. It is reasonable to suppose that future research may
    extend the present limits of fossil-bearing rocks below the horizon,
    which is marked by the occurrence of the widely distributed and oldest
    known trilobite, the genus <i>Olenellus</i>.</p>

  <p>The vast thickness of Cambrian strata was for the most part laid down
    on the floor of a comparatively deep sea; other members of the series
    represent the shingle beaches and coast deposits accumulated on the
    slopes of Archaean islands. There have been many conjectures as to the
    distribution of land and sea during the deposition of these rocks; but
    the data are too imperfect to enable us to restore with any degree
    of confidence the physical geography of this Palaeozoic epoch, of
    which the sediments stood out as islands of Cambrian land during many
    succeeding ages.</p>

  <h5 id="III_Ordovician">III.&#160; <b>Ordovician.</b></h5>

  <p>Since the days when Sedgwick and Murchison first worked out the
    succession of Palaeozoic strata in North Wales, there has always
    existed a considerable difference of opinion as to the best method of
    subdividing the Cambrian-Silurian strata. Later research has shown
    that the rocks included by Sedgwick in his Cambrian system, fall
    naturally into two groups; for the upper of these Prof. Lapworth has
    suggested the term Ordovician, from the name of the Ordovices, who
    inhabited a part of northern Wales. At the base of the system we have
    a series of volcanic and sedimentary rocks to which Sedgwick gave the
    name Arenig; above these there occur the Llandeilo Flags, succeeded
    by a considerable thickness of rocks known as the Bala series. The
    rocks making up these Ordovician sediments consist for the most part
    of slates, sandstones and limestones with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> volcanic ashes and lavas.
    Much of the typical Welsh scenery owes its character to the folded and
    weathered rocks laid down on the floor of the Ordovician sea, on which
    from many centres of volcanic activity lava streams and showers of ash
    were spread out between sheets of marine sediment. The Arenig Hills,
    Snowdonia, and many other parts of North and South Wales, parts of
    Shropshire, Scotland, Sweden, Russia, Bohemia, North America and other
    regions consist of great thicknesses of Ordovician strata.</p>

  <h5 id="IV_Silurian">IV.&#160; <b>Silurian.</b></h5>

  <p>Passing up a stage higher in the geologic series, we have a succession
    of conglomerates, sandstones, shales, and limestones; in other words,
    a series of beds which represent pebbly shore deposits, the sands
    and muds of deeper water, and the accumulated débris of calcareous
    skeletons of animals which lived in the clear water of the Silurian
    sea. The term Silurian (Siluria was the country of Caractacus and the
    old Britons known as Silures<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>) was first applied by Murchison in
    1835 to a more comprehensive series of rocks than are now included
    in the Silurian system. The rocks of this period occur in Wales,
    Shropshire, parts of Scotland, Ireland, Scandinavia, Russia, the
    United States and other countries. After the accumulation of the
    thick Ordovician sediments, the sea-floor was upraised and in places
    converted into ridges or islands of land, of which the detritus formed
    part of the material of Silurian deposits. The limestones of the
    Wenlock ridge have yielded an abundant fauna, consisting of corals,
    crinoids, molluscs and other invertebrates. In this period we have the
    first representatives of the Vertebrata, discovered in the rocks of
    Ludlow. In fact, in the Silurian period, “all the great divisions of
    the Animal Kingdom were already represented<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>
  <h5 id="V_Devonian">V.&#160; <b>Devonian.</b></h5>

  <p>By the continued elevation of the Silurian sea-floor, large portions
    became dry land, and during the succeeding period most of the British
    area formed part of a continental mass. Over the southern part of
    England, there still lay an arm of the sea, and in this were laid
    down the marine sediments which now form part of Devon, and from
    which the name Devonian has been taken as a convenient designation
    for the strata of this period. In parts of the northern land, in the
    region now occupied by Scotland, there were large inland lakes, on
    the floor of which vast thicknesses of shingle beds and coarse sands
    (“Old Red Sandstone”) were slowly accumulated; and it has been shown
    by Sir Archibald Geikie and others that during this epoch there were
    considerable outpourings of volcanic material in the Scotch area.</p>

  <p>Farther to the West and South-west there was another large lake in
    which the so-called Kiltorkan beds of Ireland were deposited. In these
    Irish sediments, and others of the same age in Belgium and elsewhere
    a few forms of land plants have been discovered; but it is from the
    Devonian rocks of North America that most of our knowledge of the flora
    of this period has been obtained.</p>

  <h5 id="VI_Carboniferous">VI.&#160; <b>Carboniferous.</b></h5>

  <p>From the point of view of palaeobotany, the shales, sandstones, and
    seams of coal included in the Carboniferous system are of special
    interest. It is from the relics of this Palaeozoic vegetation that the
    most important botanical lessons have been learnt.</p>

  <p>The following classification of Carboniferous rocks shows the order of
    succession of the various beds, and the nature of the rocks which were
    formed at this stage in the Earth’s history.</p>

  <p>The thick beds of mountain limestone, with their characteristic marine
    fossil shells and corals play an important part in English scenery.
    In Derbyshire, West Yorkshire, and other places, the limestone crags
    and hills are made up of the raised floor of a comparatively deep
    Carboniferous sea, which covered a considerable portion of the British
    Isles at the beginning of this epoch.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS.</div>

  <p>The accumulation of the calcareous skeletons of marine animals,
    with masses of coral, veritable shell-banks of extinct oyster-like
    lamellibranchs, built up during the lapse of a long period of time,
    formed widespread deposits of calcareous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>sediments. These were
    eventually succeeded by less pure calcareous deposits, the sea became
    shallower, and land detritus found its way over an area formerly
    occupied by the clear waters of an open sea. The shallowing process
    was gradually continued, and the sea was by some means converted into
    a more confined fresh-water or brackish area, in which were laid down
    many hundred feet of coarse sandy sediments derived from the waste
    of granitic highlands. Finally the conditions became less constant;
    the continuous deposition of sandy detritus being interrupted by the
    more or less complete filling up of the area of sedimentation, and the
    formation of a land surface which supported a luxuriant vegetation,
    of which the débris was subsequently converted into beds of coal. By
    further subsidence the land was again submerged, and the forest-covered
    area became overspread with sands and muds.</p>

  <p>Such are the imperfect outlines of the general physical conditions
    which are represented by the series of sedimentary strata included in
    the Carboniferous system. At the close of this period, the Earth’s
    surface in Western Europe was subjected to crust-foldings on a large
    scale, along lines running approximately North and South and East and
    West, the two sets of movements resulting in the formation of ridges
    of Carboniferous rocks. The uppermost series of grits, sandstones and
    coal-seams were in great part removed by denudation from the crests
    of the elevated ridges, but remained in the intervening troughs or
    basins where they were less exposed to denudation. It is the direct
    consequence of this, that we have our Coal-Measures preserved in the
    form of detached basins of upper Carboniferous beds.</p>

  <p>A closer examination of the comparative thickness and succession of
    Carboniferous rocks in different parts of Britain shows very clearly
    that in the northern area of Scotland and in the North of England the
    conditions were different from those which obtained further South.
    Seeing how much palaeobotanical interest attaches to these rocks, it is
    important to treat a little more fully of their geology.</p>

  <p>In parts of Devon, Cornwall and West Somerset, the Devonian strata
    are succeeded by a series of folded and contorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> rocks which have
    yielded a comparatively small number of Carboniferous fossils.
    To this succession of limestones, shales and grits the term
    <em>Culm-Measures</em> was applied by Sedgwick and Murchison in 1837.
    The rocks of this series occupy a trough between the Devonian rocks
    of North and South Devon. While some authorities have correlated
    the Culm-Measures with the Millstone Grit, others regard them as
    representing a portion of the true Coal-Measures, as well as the
    Carboniferous and Lower Limestone Shale<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. It has recently been
    shown that among the lower Culm strata there occur bands of ancient
    deep-sea sediments, consisting of beds of chert containing siliceous
    casts of various species of Radiolaria. There can be no doubt that
    the discovery of deep-sea fossils in this particular development of
    the British Carboniferous system leads to the conclusion that “while
    the massive deposits of the Carboniferous limestone—formed of the
    skeletons of calcareous organisms—were in process of growth in the seas
    to the North, there existed to the South-west a deeper ocean in which
    siliceous organisms predominated and formed these siliceous radiolarian
    rocks<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.”</p>

  <p>The Upper Culm-Measures consist of conglomerates, grits, sandstones
    and shales with some plant remains and other fossils, and constitute a
    typical set of shallow water sediments. In Westphalia, the Harz region,
    Thuringia, Silesia and Moravia there are rocks corresponding to the
    Culm-Measures of Devon, and some of these have also afforded evidence
    of deep water conditions.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">COAL-MEASURES.</div>

  <p><em>S. W. England, S. Wales, Derbyshire and Yorkshire.</em> In these
    districts the Carboniferous limestone reaches a considerable thickness;
    in the Mendips it has a thickness of 3000 feet, and in the Pennine
    chain of 4000 feet. At the base of this limestone series there occurs
    in the southern districts the so-called lower limestone shale,
    consisting of clays, shales and sandy beds. Above the limestone
    we have the Millstone grit and Coal-Measures; but in the Pennine
    district there is a series of rocks consisting of impure limestones
    and shales, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>intercalated between the Millstone grit and Carboniferous
    limestone; for this group of rocks the term <em>Yoredale series</em> has
    been proposed. In the Isle of Man and Derbyshire sheets of lava are
    interbedded with the calcareous sediments, affording clear proof of
    submarine volcanic eruptions.</p>

  <p><em>N. England and Scotland.</em> In the Carboniferous rocks of
    Northumberland we have distinct indications of a shallower sea. The
    regular succession of limestone strata in West Yorkshire and other
    districts, gives place to a series of thinner beds of limestones,
    interstratified with shales and impure calcareous rocks. We have
    come within the range of land detritus which was spread out on
    the floor of a shallow sea. The lowest portion of the Mountain
    limestone is here represented by about 200 feet of shales and
    other rocks grouped together in the <em>Tuedian series</em>. The
    Upper Carboniferous limestone and Yoredale rocks of Yorkshire are
    represented by sandstones, carbonaceous limestones and some seams of
    coal, included in the <em>Bernician series</em>. Further north, again,
    another classification has been proposed for the still more aberrant
    succession of rocks; the lowest being spoken of as the <em>Calciferous
    sandstone</em>, and the upper as the <em>Carboniferous limestone</em>. The
    calciferous sandstone may be compared with the lower limestone shale
    and part of the Carboniferous limestone of England. The Carboniferous
    limestone of Scotland probably represents the upper part of the
    limestone of England and the Yoredale rocks of the Pennine and other
    areas.</p>

  <p>Turning to the upper members of the Carboniferous system—in the
    Coal-Measures, as they were called in 1817 by William Smith,—we have a
    series of coal seams, sandstones, shales, and ironstones occurring for
    the most part in basin-shaped areas. As a general rule, each seam of
    coal, which varies in thickness from one inch to thirty feet, rests on
    a characteristic unstratified argillaceous rock known as Underclay.</p>

  <p>The accompanying diagram (Fig. 4) illustrates the frequent
    intercalation of small bands of argillaceous and sandy rocks associated
    with the seams of coal.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

  <p>The usual classification adopted for the British Coal-Measures is that
    of Upper, Middle, and Lower Coal-Measures; between the Upper and Middle
    divisions there occur certain transition or passage beds which are
    known as the Transition series. Continental writers, and more recently
    Mr Kidston of Stirling, have attempted with considerable success to
    correlate the Coal-producing strata by means of fossil plants<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.</p>

  <p>Finally, some reference must be made to the occurrence of Carboniferous
    rocks underneath more recent strata. In a geological map, or bird’s-eye
    view of a country, we see such rocks as appear at the surface; by
    means of deep borings, however, we are occasionally enabled to follow
    the course of older beds a considerable distance below the usually
    accessible <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>part of the Earth’s crust. In the neighbourhood of London,
    Dover, and other places we have Tertiary and Mesozoic strata forming
    the surface of the country, but below these comparatively recent
    formations, the sinking of deep wells and other borings have proved
    the existence of a ridge of Palaeozoic rocks stretching from the
    South Wales Coal-field through the South-east of England to northern
    France, Belgium and Westphalia. It is from rocks forming part of this
    old ridge that characteristic Coal-Measure plants have been obtained
    from the Dover boring. In Fig. 5 is shown an almost complete pinnule
    of <i>Neuropteris Scheuchzeri</i> Hoffm., a well-known fern, marking
    a definite horizon of Upper Carboniferous rocks<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. The small hairs
    on the pinnules, shown in the figure as fine lines lying more or
    less parallel to the midrib and across the lateral veins, are a
    characteristic feature of this species.</p>

  <h5 id="VII_Permian">VII. <b>Permian.</b></h5>

  <p>Reference has already been made to the earth-foldings which marked
    the close of Carboniferous times; “the open Mediterranean sea of the
    Carboniferous period in Europe was converted into a large inland sea,
    like the Caspian of the present day, surrounded by a rocky and hilly
    continent, on which grew trees and plants of various kinds<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.” In
    parts of</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

  <p>Lancashire, Westmoreland, the Eden Valley, and in the East of England
    from Sunderland to Nottingham, there occurs a succession of limestones,
    sandstones, clays and other rocks with occasional beds of rock-salt
    and gypsum, which represent the various forms of sediment and chemical
    precipitates formed on the floor of Permian lakes. The poverty of the
    fauna and flora of Permian strata points to conditions unfavourable
    to life; and there can be little doubt that the characteristic red
    rocks of St Bees Head, and the creamy limestones of the Durham coast
    are the upraised sediments of an inland salt-water lake. The term Dyas
    was proposed by Marcou for this series of strata as represented in
    Germany, where the rocks are conveniently grouped in two series, the
    <em>Magnesian limestone</em> or <em>Zechstein</em> and the red sandstones
    or <em>Rothliegendes</em>. The older and better known name of Permian was
    instituted by Murchison for the rocks of this age, from their extreme
    development in the old kingdom of Permia in Russia. Unfortunately
    considerable confusion has arisen from the employment of different
    names for rocks of the same geological period; and the grouping of
    the beds varies in different parts of the world. It is of interest to
    note, that in the Tyrol, Carinthia, and other places there are found
    patches of old marine beds which were originally laid down in an open
    sea, which extended over the site of the Mediterranean, into Russia
    and Asia. In Bohemia, the Harz district, Autun in Burgundy, and other
    regions, there are seams of Permian coal interstratified with the marls
    and sands. From these last named beds many fossil plants have been
    obtained, and important palaeobotanical facts brought to light by the
    investigations of continental workers. Volcanic eruptions, accompanied
    by lava streams and showers of ash, have been recognised in the Permian
    rocks of Scotland, and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>In North America, Australia, and India the term Permo-Carboniferous is
    often made use of in reference to the continuous and regular sequence
    of beds which were formed towards the close of the Carboniferous and
    into the succeeding Permian epoch. The enormous series of freshwater
    Indian rocks, to which geologists have given the name of the
    <span class="smcap">Gondwana</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> <span class="smcap">system</span>, includes the sediments of more
    than one geological period, some of the older members being regarded
    as Permo-Carboniferous in age. These Indian beds, with others in
    Australia, South Africa, and South America, are of special interest on
    account of the characteristic southern hemisphere plants which they
    have afforded, and from the association with the fossiliferous strata
    of extensive boulder beds pointing to widespread glacial conditions.</p>

  <h5 id="VIII_Trias">VIII. <b>Trias.</b></h5>

  <p>As we ascend the geologic series, and pass up to the rocks overlying
    the Permian deposits, there are found many indications of a marked
    change in the records of animal and plant life. Many of the
    characteristic Palaeozoic fossils are no longer represented, and
    in their place we meet with fresh and in many cases more highly
    differentiated organisms. The threefold division of the rocks of this
    period which suggested the term Trias to those who first worked out the
    succession of the strata, is typically illustrated over a wide area in
    Germany, in which the lowest or <em>Bunter</em> series is followed by the
    calcareous <em>Muschelkalk</em>, and this again by the clays, rock-salt,
    and sandstones of the <em>Keuper</em> series. In the Cheshire plain
    and in the low ground of the Midlands, we have a succession of red
    sandstones, conglomerates, and layers of rock-salt which correspond to
    the Bunter and Keuper beds of German geologists. These Triassic rocks
    were obviously formed in salt-water lakes, in which from time to time
    long continued evaporation gave rise to extensive deposit of rock-salt
    and other minerals. From the fact that it is this type of Triassic
    sediments which was first made known, it is often forgotten that the
    British and German rocks are not the typical representatives of this
    geological period. The ‘Alpine’ Trias of the Mediterranean region,
    in Asia, North America, and other countries, has a totally different
    facies, and includes limestones and dolomites of deep-sea origin. “The
    widespread Alpine Trias is the pelagic facies of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> formation; the
    more restricted German Trias, on the other hand, is a shallow shore,
    bay or inland sea formation<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.”</p>

  <p>In the Keuper beds of southern Sweden there are found workable
    seams of coal, and the beds of this district have yielded numerous
    well-preserved examples of the Triassic flora. A more impure coal
    occurs in the lower Keuper of Thuringia and S.-W. Germany, and to this
    group of rocks the term <em>Lettenkohle</em> is occasionally applied.</p>

  <p>In the Rhaetic Alps of Lombardy, in the Tyrol, and in England, from
    Yorkshire to Lyme Regis, Devonshire, Somersetshire, and other districts
    there are certain strata at the top of the Triassic system known as
    the <em>Rhaetic</em> or <em>Penarth</em> beds. The uppermost Rhaetic beds,
    often described as the White Lias, afford evidence of a change from
    the salt lakes of the Trias to the open sea of the succeeding Jurassic
    period. Passing beyond this period of salt lakes and wind-swept barren
    tracts of land, we enter on another phase of the earth’s history.</p>

  <h5 id="IX_Jurassic">IX. <b>Jurassic.</b></h5>

  <p>The Jura mountains of western Switzerland consist in great part of
    folded and contorted rocks which were originally deposited on the
    floor of a Jurassic sea. In England the Jurassic rocks are of special
    interest, both for geological and historical reasons, as it is in them
    that we find a rich fauna and flora of Mesozoic age, and it was the
    classification of these beds by means of their fossil contents that
    gained for William Smith the title of the Father of English Geology. A
    glance at a geological map of England shows a band of Jurassic rocks
    stretching across from the Yorkshire coast to Dorset. These are in a
    large measure calcareous, argillaceous, and arenaceous sediments of an
    open sea; but towards the upper limit of the series, both freshwater
    and terrestrial beds are met with. Numerous fragments of old coral
    reefs, sea-urchins, crinoids, and other marine fossils are especially
    abundant; in the freshwater beds and old surface-soils, as well as in
    the marine sandstones <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>and shales, we have remnants of an exceedingly
    rich and apparently tropical vegetation. This was an age of Reptiles
    as well as an age of Cycads. An interesting feature of these widely
    distributed Jurassic strata is the evidence they afford of distinct
    climatal zones; there are clear indications, according to the late Dr
    Neumayr, of a Mediterranean, a middle European, and a Boreal or Russian
    province<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. The subdivisions of the English Jurassic rocks are as

  <p>In tracing the several groups across England, and into other parts of
    Europe, their characters are naturally found to vary considerably; in
    one area a series is made up of typical clear water or comparatively
    deep sea sediments, and in another we have shallow water and shore
    deposits of the same age. The Lias rocks have been further subdivided
    into zones by means of the species of Ammonites which form so
    characteristic a feature of the Jurassic fauna. In the lower Oolite
    strata there are shelly limestones, clays, sandstones, and beds of
    lignite and ironstone. Without discussing the other subdivisions of
    the Jurassic period, we may note that in the uppermost members there
    are preserved patches of old surface-soils exposed in the face of the
    cliffs of the Dorset coast and of the Isle of Portland.</p>

  <h5 id="X_Cretaceous">X. <b>Cretaceous.</b></h5>

  <p>In the south of England, and in some other districts, it is difficult
    to draw any definite line between the uppermost strata of the Jurassic
    and the lowest of the Cretaceous period. The rocks of the so-called
    <em>Wealden</em> series of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and the Isle of Wight,
    are usually classed as Lower Cretaceous, but there is strong evidence
    in favour of regarding them as sediments of the Jurassic period.
    The Cretaceous rocks of England are generally speaking parallel to
    the Jurassic strata, and occupy a stretch of country from the east
    of Yorkshire and the Norfolk coast to Dorset in the south-west. The
    Chalk downs and cliffs represent the most familiar type of Cretaceous
    strata. In the white chalk with its numerous flints, we have part
    of the elevated floor of a comparatively deep sea, which extended
    in Cretaceous times over a large portion of the east and south-east
    of England and other portions of the European continent. On the bed
    of this sea, beyond the reach of any river-borne detritus, there
    accumulated through long ages the calcareous and siliceous remains of
    marine animals, to be afterwards converted into chalk and flints. At
    the beginning of the period, however, other conditions obtained, and
    there extended over the south-east of England, and parts of north and
    north-west Germany and Belgium, a lake or estuary in which were built
    up deposits of clay, sand and other material, forming the delta of
    one or more large rivers. For these sediments the name <em>Wealden</em>
    was suggested in 1828. Eventually the gradual subsidence of this area
    led to an incursion of the sea, and the delta became overflowed by
    the waters of a large Cretaceous sea. At first the sea was shallow,
    and in it were laid down coarse sands and other sediments known as
    the <em>Lower Greensand</em> rocks. By degrees, as the subsidence
    continued, the shallows became deep water, and calcareous material
    slowly accumulated, to be at last upraised as beds of white chalk. The
    distribution of fossils in the Cretaceous rocks of north and south
    Europe distinctly points to the existence of two fairly well-marked
    sets of organisms in the two regions; no doubt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> expression of
    climatal zones similar to those recognised in Jurassic times. In North
    America, Cretaceous rocks are spread over a wide area, also in North
    Africa, India, South Africa, and other parts of the world. Within the
    Arctic Circle strata of this age have become famous, chiefly on account
    of the rich flora described from them by the Swiss palaeobotanist Heer.
    The fauna and flora of this epoch are alike in their advanced state of
    development and in the great variety of specific types; the highest
    class of plants is first met with at the base of the Cretaceous system.</p>

  <h5 id="XI_Tertiary">XI. <b>Tertiary.</b></h5>

  <p>“At the close of the Chalk age a change took place both in the
    distribution of land and water, and also in the development of organic
    life, so great and universal, that it has scarcely been equalled at
    any other period of the earth’s geological history<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.” The Tertiary
    period seems to bring us suddenly to the threshold of our own times. In
    England at least, the deposits of this age are of the nature of loose
    sands, clays and other materials containing shells, bones, and fossil
    plants bearing a close resemblance to organisms of the present era.
    The chalk rocks, upheaved from the Cretaceous sea, stood out as dry
    land over a large part of Britain; much of their material was in time
    removed by the action of denuding agents, and the rest gradually sank
    again beneath the waters of Tertiary lakes and estuaries. In the south
    of England, and in north Europe generally, the Tertiary rocks have
    suffered but little disturbance or folding, but in southern Europe and
    other parts of the world, the Tertiary sands have been compacted and
    hardened into sandstones, and involved in the gigantic crust-movements
    which gave birth to many of our highest mountain chains. The Alps,
    Carpathians, Apennines, Himalayas, and other ranges consist to a
    large extent of piled up and strangely folded layers of old Tertiary
    sediments. The volcanic activity of this age was responsible for the
    basaltic lavas of the Giants’ Causeway, the Isle of Staffa, and other
    parts of western Scotland.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

  <p>During the succeeding phases of this period, the distribution of land
    and sea was continually changing, climatic conditions varied within
    wide limits; and in short wherever Tertiary fossiliferous beds occur,
    we find distinct evidence of an age characterised by striking activity
    both as regards the action of dynamical as well as of organic forces.
    Sir Charles Lyell proposed a subdivision of the strata of this period
    into Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene, founding his classification on the
    percentage of recent species of molluscs contained in the various sets
    of rocks. His divisions have been generally adopted. In 1854 Prof.
    Beyrich proposed to include another subdivision in the Tertiary system,
    and to this he gave the name <em>Oligocene</em>.</p>

  <p>Occupying a basin-shaped area around London and Paris there are beds of
    Eocene sands and clays which were originally deposited as continuous
    sheets of sediment in water at first salt, afterwards brackish and
    to a certain extent fresh. In the Hampshire cliffs and in some parts
    of the Isle of Wight, we have other patches of these oldest Tertiary
    sediments. Across the south of Europe, North Africa, Arabia, Persia,
    the Himalayas, to Java and the Philippine islands, there existed in
    early Tertiary times a wide sea connecting the Atlantic and Pacific
    oceans; and it may be that in the Mediterranean of to-day we have a
    remnant of this large Eocene ocean. Later in the Tertiary period a
    similar series of beds was deposited which we now refer to as the
    Oligocene strata; such occurs in the cliffs of Headon hill in the Isle
    of Wight, containing bones of crocodiles, and turtles, with the relics
    of a rich flora preserved in the delta deposits of an Oligocene river.
    At a still later stage the British area was probably dry land, and an
    open sea existed over the Mediterranean region. In the neighbourhood
    of Vienna we have beds of this age represented by a succession of
    sediments, at first marine and afterwards freshwater. Miocene beds
    occur over a considerable area in Switzerland and the Arctic regions,
    and they have yielded a rich harvest to palaeobotanical investigators.</p>

  <p>On the coast of Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, the south of Cornwall, and
    other districts there occur beds of shelly sand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> and gravel long known
    under the name of ‘Crag.’ The beds have a very modern aspect; the
    sands have not been converted into sandstones, and the shells have
    undergone but little change. These materials were for the most part
    accumulated on the bed of a shallow sea which swept over a portion of
    East Anglia in Pliocene times. In the sediments of this age northern
    forms of shells and other organisms make their appearance, and in the
    Cromer forest-bed there occur portions of drifted trees with sands,
    clays and gravels, representing in all probability the débris thrown
    down on the banks of an ancient river. At this time the greater part
    of the North Sea was probably a low-lying forest-covered region,
    through which flowed the waters of a large river, of which part still
    exists in the modern Rhine. The lowering of temperature which became
    distinctly pronounced in the Pliocene age, continued until the greater
    part of Britain and north Europe experienced a glacial period, and such
    conditions obtained as we find to-day in ice-covered Greenland. Finally
    the ice-sheet melted, the local glaciers of North Wales, the English
    Lake district and other hilly regions, retreated, and after repeated
    alterations in level, the land of Great Britain assumed its modern
    form. The submerged forests and peat beds familiar in many parts of the
    coast, the diatomaceous deposits of dried up lakes, “remain as the very
    finger touches of the last geological change.”</p>

  <p id="Geological_Evolution">The agents of change and geological evolution, which we have passed in
    brief review, are still constantly at work carrying one step further
    the history of the earth. A superficial review of geological history
    gives us an impression of recurring and widespread convulsions,
    and rapidly effected revolutions in organic life and geographical
    conditions; on the other hand a closer comparison of the past and
    present, with due allowance for the enormous period of time represented
    by the records of the rocks, helps us to realise the continuity of
    geological evolution. “So that within the whole of the immense period
    indicated by the fossiliferous stratified rocks, there is assuredly
    not the slightest proof of any break in the uniformity of Nature’s

  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> discovery of a fossil, whether as an impression on the surface of a
    slab of rock or as a piece of petrified wood, naturally leads us back
    to the living plant, and invites speculation as to the circumstances
    which led to the preservation of the plant fragment. There is a certain
    fascination in endeavouring, with more or less success, to picture
    the exact conditions which obtained when the leaf or stem was carried
    along by running water and finally sealed up in a sedimentary matrix.
    Attempts to answer the question—How came the plant remains to be
    preserved as fossils?—are not merely of abstract interest appealing
    to the imagination, but are of considerable importance in the correct
    interpretation of the facts which are to be gleaned from the records of
    plant-bearing strata.</p>

  <p>Before describing any specific examples of the commoner methods of
    fossilisation; we shall do well to briefly consider how plants are
    now supplying material for the fossils of a future age. In the great
    majority of cases, an appreciation of the conditions of sedimentation,
    and of the varied circumstances attending the transport and
    accumulation of vegetable débris, supplies the solution of a problem
    akin to that of the fly in amber and the manner in which it came there.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">OLD SURFACE-SOILS.</div>

  <p>Seeing that the greater part of the sedimentary strata have been formed
    in the sea, and as the sea rather than the land has been for the most
    part the scene of rock-building in the past, it is not surprising
    that fossil plants are far less numerous than fossil animals. With
    the exception of the algae and a few representatives of other classes
    of plants, which live in the shallow-water belt round the coast,
    or in inland lakes and seas, plants are confined to land-surfaces;
    and unless their remains are swept along by streams and embedded in
    sediments which are accumulating on the sea floor, the chance of their
    preservation is but small. The strata richest in fossil plants are
    often those which have been laid down on the floor of an inland lake
    or spread out as river-borne sediment under the waters of an estuary.
    Unlike the hard endo- and exo-skeletons of animals, the majority of
    plants are composed of comparatively soft material, and are less likely
    to be preserved or to retain their original form when exposed to the
    wear and tear which must often accompany the process of fossilisation.</p>

  <p>The Coal-Measure rocks have furnished numberless relics of a Palaeozoic
    vegetation, and these occur in various forms of preservation in
    rocks laid down in shallow water on the edge of a forest-covered
    land. The underclays or unstratified argillaceous beds which nearly
    always underlie each seam of coal have often been described as old
    surface-soils, containing numerous remains of roots and creeping
    underground stems of forest trees. The overlying coal has been regarded
    as a mass of the carbonised and compressed débris of luxuriant forests
    which grew on the actual spot now occupied by the beds of coal. There
    are, however, many arguments in favour of regarding the coal seams as
    beds of altered vegetable material which was spread out on the floor
    of a lagoon or lake, while the underclay was an old soil covered by
    shallow water or possibly a swampy surface tenanted by marsh-loving
    plants<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.</p>

  <p>The Jurassic beds of the Yorkshire Coast, long famous as some of the
    richest plant-bearing strata in Britain, and the Wealden rocks of the
    south coast afford examples of Mesozoic sediments which were laid
    down on the floor of an estuary or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>large lake. Circumstances have
    occasionally rendered possible the preservation of old land-surfaces
    with the stumps of trees still in their position of growth. One of the
    best examples of this in Britain are the so-called dirt-beds or black
    bands of Portland and the Dorset Coast. On the cliffs immediately east
    of Lulworth Cove, the surface of a ledge of Purbeck limestone which
    juts out near the top of the cliffs, is seen to have the form here and
    there of rounded projecting bosses or ‘Burrs’ several feet in diameter.
    In the centre of each boss there is either an empty depression, or the
    remnants of a silicified stem of a coniferous tree. Blocks of limestone
    3 to 5 feet long and of about equal thickness may be found lying on
    the rocky ledge presenting the appearance of massive sarcophagi in
    which the central trough still contains the silicified remains of an
    entombed tree. The calcareous sediment no doubt oozed up to envelope
    the thick stem as it sank into the soft mud. An examination of the rock
    just below the bed bearing these curious circular elevations reveals
    the existence of a comparatively narrow band of softer material, which
    has been worn away by denuding agents more rapidly than the overlying
    limestone. This band consists of partially rounded or subangular stones
    associated with carbonaceous material, and probably marks the site of
    an old surface-soil. This old soil is well shown in the cliffs and
    quarries of Portland, and similar dirt-beds occur at various horizons
    in the Lower and Middle Purbeck Series<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. In this case, then, we
    have intercalated in a series of limestone beds containing marine and
    freshwater shells two or three plant beds containing numerous and
    frequently large specimens of cycadean and coniferous stems, lying
    horizontally or standing in their original position of growth. These
    are vestiges of an ancient forest which spread over a considerable
    extent of country towards the close of the Jurassic period. The trunks
    of cycads, long familiar in the Isle of Portland as fossil crows’
    nests, have usually the form of round depressed stems with the central
    portion somewhat hollowed out. It was supposed by the quarrymen that
    they were petrified birds’ nests which had been built in the forks of
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>trees which grew in the Portland forest. The beds separating the
    surface-soils of the Purbeck Series, as seen in the sections exposed
    on the cliffs or quarries, point to the subsidence of a forest-covered
    area over which beds of water-borne sediment were gradually deposited,
    until in time the area became dry land and was again taken possession
    of by a subtropical vegetation, to be once more depressed and sealed up
    under layers of sediment<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

  <p>A still more striking example of the preservation of forest trees
    rooted in an old surface-soil is afforded by the so-called fossil-grove
    in Victoria Park, Glasgow, (Frontispiece). The stumps of several
    trees, varying in diameter from about one to three feet, are fixed by
    long forking ‘roots’ in a bed of shale. In some cases the spreading
    ‘roots,’ which bear the surface features of <i>Stigmaria</i>, extend
    for a distance of more than ten feet from the base of the trunk. The
    stem surface is marked by irregular wrinklings which suggest a fissured
    bark; but the superficial characters are very imperfectly preserved.
    In one place a flattened <i>Lepidodendron</i> stem, about 30 feet
    long, lies prone on the shale. Each of the rooted stumps is oval or
    elliptical in section, and the long axes of the several stems are
    approximately parallel, pointing to some cause operating in a definite
    direction which gave to the stems their present form. Near one of the
    trees, and at a somewhat higher level than its base, the surface of the
    rock is clearly ripple-marked, and takes us back to the time when the
    sinking forest trees were washed by waves which left an impress in the
    soft mud laid down over the submerged area. The stumps appear to be
    those of Lepidodendron trees, rooted in Lower Carboniferous rocks. From
    their manner of occurrence it would seem that we have in them a corner
    of a Palaeozoic forest in which Lepidodendra played a conspicuous part.
    The shales and sandstones containing the fossil trees were originally
    overlain by a bed of igneous rock which had been forced up as a sheet
    of lava into the hardened sands and clays<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

  <p>Other examples of old surface-soils occur in different parts of the
    world and in rocks of various ages. As an instance of a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>land surface
    preserved in a different manner, reference may be made to the thin
    bands of reddish or brown material as well as clays and shale which
    occasionally occur between the sheets of Tertiary lava in the Western
    Isles of Scotland and the north-east of Ireland. In the intervals
    between successive outpourings of basaltic lava in the north-west of
    Europe during the early part of the Tertiary period, the heated rocks
    became gradually cooler, and under the influence of weathering agents a
    surface-soil was produced fit for the growth of plants. In some places,
    too, shallow lakes were formed, and leaves, fruits and twigs became
    embedded in lacustrine sediments, to be afterwards sealed up by later
    streams of lava. In the face of the cliff at Ardtun Head on the coast
    of Mull a leaf-bed is exposed between two masses of gravel underlying
    a basaltic lava flow; the impressions of the leaves of <i>Gingko</i>
    and other plants from the Tertiary sediments of this district are
    exceptionally beautiful and well preserved<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. A large collection
    obtained by Mr Starkie Gardner may be seen in the British Museum.</p>

  <p>In 1883 the Malayan island of Krakatoa, 20 miles from Sumatra and
    Java, was the scene of an exceptionally violent volcanic explosion.
    Two-thirds of the island were blown away, and the remnant was left
    absolutely bare of organic life. In 1886 it was found that several
    plants had already established themselves on the hardened and weathered
    crust of the Krakatoan rocks, the surface of the lavas having been to a
    large extent prepared for the growth of the higher plants by the action
    of certain blue-green algae which represent some of the lowest types
    of plant life<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. We may perhaps assume a somewhat similar state of
    things to have existed in the volcanic area in north-west Europe, where
    the intervals between successive outpourings of lava are represented by
    the thin bands of leaf-beds and old surface-soils.</p>

  <p>On the Cheshire Coast at Leasowe<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and other localities, there is
    exposed at low water a tract of black peaty ground studded with old
    rooted stumps of conifers and other trees <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>(fig. 6). There is little
    reason to doubt that at all events the majority of the trees are in
    their natural place of growth. The peaty soil on which they rest
    contains numerous flattened stems of reeds and other plants, and is
    penetrated by roots, probably of some aquatic or marshy plants which
    spread over the site of the forest as it became gradually submerged. A
    lower forest-bed rests directly on a foundation of boulder clay. Such
    submerged forests are by no means uncommon around the British coast;
    many of them belong to a comparatively recent period, posterior to the
    glacial age. In many cases, however, the tree stumps have been drifted
    from the places where they grew and eventually deposited in their
    natural position, the roots of the trees, in some cases aided by stones
    entangled in their branches, being heavier than the stem portion.
    There is a promising field for botanical investigation in the careful
    analysis of the floras of submerged forests; the work of Clement Reid,
    Nathorst, Andersson and others, serves to illustrate the value of such
    research in the hands of competent students.</p>

  <p>The following description by Lyell, taken from his American travels,
    is of interest as affording an example of the preservation of a
    surface-soil:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“On our way home from Charleston, by the railway from Orangeburg, I
      observed a thin black line of charred vegetable matter exposed in
      the perpendicular section of the bank. The sand cast out in digging
      the railway had been thrown up on the original soil, on which
      the pine forest grew; and farther excavations had laid open the
      junction of the rubbish and the soil. As geologists, we may learn
      from this fact how a thin seam of vegetable matter, an inch or two
      thick, is often the only monument to be looked for of an ancient
      surface of dry land, on which a luxuriant forest may have grown
      for thousands of years. Even this seam of friable matter may be
      washed away when the region is submerged, and, if not, rain water
      percolating freely through the sand may, in the course of ages,
      gradually carry away the carbon<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="sidenote">FOSSIL WOOD.</div>

  <p>In addition to the remnants of ancient soils, and the preservation of
    plant fragments in rocks which have been formed on the floor of an
    inland lake or an estuary, it is by no means rare to find fossil plants
    in obviously marine sediments. In fig. 7 we <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>have a piece of coniferous
    wood with the shell of an Ammonite (<i>Aegoceras planicosta</i> Sow.)
    lying on it; the specimen was found in the Lower Lias clay at Lyme
    Regis, and illustrates the accidental association of a drifted piece
    of a forest tree with a shell which marks at once the age and the
    marine character of the beds. Again in fig. 8 we have a block of flint
    partially enclosing a piece of coniferous wood in which the internal
    structure has been clearly preserved in silica. This specimen was found
    in the chalk, a deposit laid down in the clear and deep water of the
    Cretaceous sea. The wood must have floated for some time before it
    became water-logged and sank to the sea-floor. In the light coloured
    wood there occur here and there dark spots which mark the position of
    siliceous plugs <i>b, b</i> filling up clean cut holes bored by Teredos
    in the woody tissue. The wood became at last enclosed by siliceous
    sediment and its tissues penetrated by silica in solution, which
    gradually replaced and preserved in wonderful perfection the form of
    the original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> tissue. A similar instance of wood enclosed in flint was
    figured by Mantell in 1844 in his <cite>Medals of Creation</cite><a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">CONDITIONS OF FOSSILISATION.</div>

  <p>Before discussing a few more examples of fossils illustrating different
    methods of fossilisation, it may not be out of place to quote a few
    extracts from travellers’ narratives which enable us to realise more
    readily the circumstances and conditions under which plant remains have
    been preserved in the Earth’s crust.</p>

  <p>In an account of a journey down the Rawas river in Sumatra, Forbes thus
    describes the flooded country:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The whole surface of the water was covered, absolutely in a close
      sheet, with petals, fruits and leaves, of innumerable species. In
      placid corners sometimes I noted a collected mass nearly half a
      foot deep, among which, on examination, I could scarcely find a
      leaf that was perfect, or that remained attached to its rightful
      neighbour, so that were they to become imbedded in some soft muddy
      spot, and in after ages to reappear in a fossil form they would
      afford a few difficult puzzles to the palaeontologist, both to
      separate and to put together<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>An interesting example of the mixture of plants and animals in
    sedimentary deposits is described by Hooker in his Himalayan Journals:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“To the geologist the Jheels and Sunderbunds are a most instructive
      region, as whatever may be the mean elevation of their waters,
      a permanent depression of ten to fifteen feet would submerge an
      immense tract, which the Ganges, Burrampooter, and Soormah would
      soon cover with beds of silt and sand.</p>

    <p>“There would be extremely few shells in the beds thus formed,
      the southern and northern divisions of which would present two
      very different floras and faunas, and would in all probability
      be referred by future geologists to widely different epochs. To
      the north, beds of peat would be formed by grasses, and in other
      parts temperate and tropical forms of plants and animals would be
      preserved in such equally balanced proportions as to confound the
      palaeontologist; with the bones of the long-snouted alligator,
      Gangetic porpoise, Indian cow, buffalo, rhinoceros, elephant,
      tiger, deer, bear, and a host of other animals, he would meet with
      acorns of several species of oak, pine-cones and magnolia fruits,
      rose seeds, and <i>Cycas</i> nuts, with palm nuts, screw-pines, and
      other tropical productions<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In another place the same author writes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“On the 12th of January, 1848, the <cite>Moozuffer</cite> was steaming
      amongst the low, swampy islands of the Sunderbunds.... Every now
      and then the paddles of the steamer tossed up the large fruits of
      <i>Nypa fruticans</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>Thunb., a low stemless palm that grows in
      the tidal waters of the Indian Ocean, and bears a large head of
      nuts. It is a plant of no interest to the common observer, but of
      much to the geologist, from the nuts of a similar plant abounding
      in the Tertiary formations at the mouth of the Thames, having
      floated about there in as great profusion as here, till buried deep
      in the silt and mud that now forms the island of Sheppey<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.”</p>

  <div class="sidenote">DRIFTING OF TREES.</div>

  <p>Of the drifting of timber, fruits, &amp;c., we find numerous accounts in
    the writings of travellers. Rodway thus describes the formation of
    vegetable rafts in the rivers of Northern British Guiana:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Sometimes a great tree, whose timber is light enough to float,
      gets entangled in the grass, and becomes the nucleus of an immense
      raft, which is continually increasing in size as it gathers up
      everything that comes floating down the river<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The undermining of river banks in times of flood, and the transport of
    the drifted trees to be eventually deposited in the delta is a familiar
    occurrence in many parts of the world. The more striking instances of
    such wholesale carrying along of trees are supplied by Bates, Lyell and
    other writers. In his description of the Amazon the former writes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The currents ran with great force close to the bank, especially
      when these receded to form long bays or <i lang="pt">enseadas</i>, as they
      are called, and then we made very little headway. In such places
      the banks consist of loose earth, a rich crumbling vegetable mould,
      supporting a growth of most luxuriant forest, of which the currents
      almost daily carry away large portions, so that the stream for
      several yards out is encumbered with fallen trees, whose branches
      quiver in the current<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In another place, Bates writes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The rainy season had now set in over the region through which the
      great river flows; the sand-banks and all the lower lands were
      already under water, and the tearing current, two or three miles in
      breadth, bore along a continuous line of uprooted trees and islets
      of floating plants<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The rafts of the Mississippi and other rivers described by Lyell afford
    instructive examples of the distant transport of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>vegetable material.
    The following passage is taken from the <cite>Principles of Geology</cite>;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Within the tropics there are no ice-floes; but, as if to
      compensate for that mode of transportation, there are floating
      islets of matted trees, which are often borne along through
      considerable spaces. These are sometimes seen sailing at the
      distance of fifty or one hundred miles from the mouth of the
      Ganges, with living trees standing erect upon them. The Amazons,
      the Orinoco, and the Congo also produce these verdant rafts<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After describing the enormous natural rafts of the Atchafalaya, an arm
    of the Mississippi, and of the Red river, Lyell goes on to say:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The prodigious quantity of wood annually drifted down by the
      Mississippi and its tributaries is a subject of geological
      interest, not merely as illustrating the manner in which abundance
      of vegetable matter becomes, in the ordinary course of nature,
      imbedded in submarine and estuary deposits, but as attesting the
      constant destruction of soil and transportation of matter to lower
      levels by the tendency of rivers to shift their courses.... It
      is also found in excavating at New Orleans, even at the depth of
      several yards below the level of the sea, that the soil of the
      delta contains innumerable trunks of trees, layer above layer, some
      prostrate as if drifted, others broken off near the bottom, but
      remaining still erect, and with their roots spreading on all sides,
      as if in their natural position<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The drifting of trees in the ocean is recorded by Darwin in his
    description of Keeling Island, and their action as vehicles for the
    transport of boulders is illustrated by the same account.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In the channels of Tierra del Fuego large quantities of drift
      timber are cast upon the beach, yet it is extremely rare to meet a
      tree swimming in the water. These facts may possibly throw light
      on single stones, whether angular or rounded, occasionally found
      embedded in fine sedimentary masses<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Fruits may often be carried long distances from land, and preserved
    in beds far from their original source. Whilst cruising amongst the
    Solomon Islands, the Challenger met with fruits of <i>Barringtonia
    speciosa</i> &amp;c., 130–150 miles from the coast. Off the coast of New
    Guinea long lines of drift <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>wood were seen at right angles to the
    direction of the river; uprooted trees, logs, branches, and bark, often
    floating separately.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The midribs of the leaves of a pinnate-leaved palm were abundant,
      and also the stems of a large cane grass (<i>Saccharum</i>), like
      that so abundant on the shores of the great river in Fiji. Various
      fruits of trees and other fragments were abundant, usually floating
      confined in the midst of the small aggregations into which the
      floating timber was everywhere gathered.... Leaves were absent
      except those of the Palm, on the midrib of which some of the
      pinnæ were still present. The leaves evidently drop first to the
      bottom, whilst vegetable drift is floating from a shore; thus, as
      the débris sinks in the sea water, a deposit abounding in leaves,
      but with few fruits and little or no wood, will be formed near
      shore, whilst the wood and fruits will sink to the bottom farther
      off the land. Much of the wood was floating suspended vertically
      in the water, and most curiously, logs and short branch pieces
      thus floating often occurred in separate groups apart from the
      horizontally floating timber. The sunken ends of the wood were not
      weighted by any attached masses of soil or other load of any kind;
      possibly the water penetrates certain kinds of wood more easily in
      one direction with regard to its growth than the other, hence one
      end becomes water-logged before the other.... The wood which had
      been longest in the water was bored by a <i>Pholas</i><a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The bearing of this account on the manner of preservation of fossils,
    and the differential sorting so frequently seen in plant beds, is
    sufficiently obvious.</p>

  <p>As another instance of the great distance to which land plants may be
    carried out to sea and finally buried in marine strata, an observation
    by Bates may be cited. When 400 miles from the mouth of the main
    Amazons, he writes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“We passed numerous patches of floating grass mingled with tree
      trunks and withered foliage. Amongst these masses I espied many
      fruits of that peculiar Amazonian tree the Ubussú Palm; this was
      the last I saw of the great river<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The following additional extract from the narrative of the Cruise of
    H.M.S. Challenger illustrates in a striking degree the conflicting
    evidence which the contents of fossiliferous beds may occasionally
    afford; it describes what was observed in an excursion from Sydney to
    Berowra Creek, a branch of the main estuary or inlet into which flows
    the Hawkesbury river. It <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>was impossible to say where the river came
    to an end and the sea began. The Creek is described as a long tortuous
    arm of the sea, 10 to 15 miles long, with the side walls covered with
    orchids and <i>Platycerium</i>. The ferns and palms were abundant in
    the lateral shady glens; marine and inland animals lived in close
    proximity.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Here is a narrow strip of the sea water, twenty miles distant
      from the open sea; on a sandy shallow flat close to its head
      are to be seen basking in the sun numbers of sting-rays.... All
      over these flats, and throughout the whole stretch of the creek,
      shoals of Grey Mullet are to be met with; numerous other marine
      fish inhabit the creek. Porpoises chase the mullet right up to
      the commencement of the sand-flat. At the shores of the creek the
      rocks are covered with masses of excellent oysters and mussel, and
      other shell-bearing molluscs are abundant, whilst a small crab is
      to be found in numbers in every crevice. On the other hand the
      water is overhung by numerous species of forest trees, by orchids
      and ferns, and other vegetation of all kinds; mangroves grow only
      in the shallow bays. The gum trees lean over the water in which
      swim the <i>Trygon</i> and mullet, just as willows hang over a
      pool of carp. The sandy bottom is full of branches and stems of
      trees, and is covered in patches here and there by their leaves.
      Insects constantly fall in the water, and are devoured by the
      mullet. Land birds of all kinds fly to and fro across the creek,
      and when wounded may easily be drowned in it. Wallabies swim across
      occasionally, and may add their bones to the débris at the bottom.
      Hence here is being formed a sandy deposit, in which may be found
      cetacean, marsupial, bird, fish, and insect remains, together with
      land and sea shells, and fragments of a vast land flora; yet how
      restricted is the area occupied by this deposit, and how easily
      might surviving fragments of such a record be missed by future
      geological explorers!<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="sidenote">MEANING OF THE TERM ‘FOSSIL.’</div>

  <p>The term ‘fossil’ suggests to the lay mind a petrifaction or a
    replacement by mineral matter of the plant tissues. In the scientific
    sense, a fossil plant, that is a plant or part of a plant whether
    in the form of a true petrifaction or a structureless mould or
    cast, which has been buried in the earth by natural causes, may be
    indistinguishable from a piece of recent wood lately fallen from the
    parent tree. In the geologically recent peat beds such little altered
    fossils (or sub-fossils) are common enough, and even in older rocks
    the more resistant parts of plant fragments are often found in a
    practically unaltered state. In the leaf impressions on an impervious
    clay, the brown-walled <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>epidermis shows scarcely any indication of
    alteration since it was deposited in the soft mud of a river’s delta.
    Such fossil leaves are common in the English Tertiary beds, and even in
    Palaeozoic rocks it is not uncommon to find an impression of a plant
    on a bed of shale from which the thin brown epidermis may be peeled
    off the rock, and if microscopically examined it will be found to have
    retained intact the contours of the cuticularised epidermal cells. A
    striking example of a similar method of preservation is afforded by
    the so-called paper-coal of Culm age from the Province of Toula in
    Russia<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. In the Russian area the Carboniferous or Permian rocks have
    been subjected to little lateral pressure, and unlike the beds of the
    same age in Western Europe, they have not been folded and compressed by
    widespread and extensive crust-foldings. Instead of the hard seams of
    coal there occur beds of a dark brown laminated material, made up very
    largely of the cuticles of Lepidodendroid plants.</p>

  <p>From such examples we may naturally pass to fossils in which the plant
    structure has been converted into carbonaceous matter or even pure
    coal. This form of preservation is especially common in plant-bearing
    beds at various geological horizons. In other cases, again, some
    mineral solution, oxide of iron, talc, and other substances, has
    replaced the plant tissues. From the Coal-Measures of Switzerland Heer
    has figured numerous specimens of fern fronds and other plants in which
    the leaf form has been left on the dark coloured rock surface as a thin
    layer of white talcose material<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. In the Buntersandstone of the
    Vosges and other districts the red imperfectly preserved impressions
    of plant stems and leaves are familiar fossils<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>; the carbonaceous
    substance of the tissues has been replaced by a brown or red oxide of
    iron.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">INCRUSTATIONS.</div>

  <p>Plants frequently occur in the form of incrustations; and in fact
    incrustations, which may assume a variety of forms, are the commonest
    kind of fossil. The action of incrusting springs, or as they are
    often termed petrifying springs, is illustrated at Knaresborough, in
    Yorkshire, and many other places where <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>water highly charged with
    carbonate of lime readily deposits calcium carbonate on objects placed
    in the path of the stream.</p>

  <p>The travertine deposited in this manner forms an incrustation on plant
    fragments, and if the vegetable substance is subsequently removed by
    the action of water or decay, a mould of the embedded fragment is
    left in the calcareous matrix. An instructive example of this form of
    preservation was described in 1868<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> by Sharpe from an old gravel
    pit near Northampton. He found in a section eight feet high (fig. 10),
    a mass of incrusted plants of <i>Chara</i> (<i>a</i>) resting on and
    overlain by a calcareous paste (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) made up of
    the decomposed material of the overlying rock, and this again resting
    on sand. The place where the section occurred was originally the site
    of a pool in which Stoneworts grew in abundance. Large blocks of these
    incrusted Charas may be seen in the fossil-plant gallery of the British
    Museum.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter">

    <figcaption class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 10. Section of an old pool filled up with
      a mass of <i>Chara</i>. (From the <cite>Geol. Mag.</cite> vol. v. 1868, p. 563.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In the Natural History Museum in the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, one
    of the table-cases contains what appear to be small models of flowers
    in green wax. These are in reality casts in wax of the moulds or
    cavities left in a mass of calcareous travertine, on the decay and
    disappearance of the encrusted flowers and other plant fragments<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.
    This porous calcareous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>rock occurs near Sézanne in Southern France,
    and is of Eocene age<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. The plants were probably blown on to the
    freshly deposited carbonate of lime, or they may have simply fallen
    from the tree on to the incrusting matrix; more material was afterwards
    deposited and the flowers were completely enclosed. Eventually the
    plant substance decayed, and as the matrix hardened moulds were left
    of the vegetable fragments. Wax was artificially forced into these
    cavities and the surrounding substance removed by the action of an
    acid, and thus perfect casts were obtained of Tertiary flowers.</p>

  <p>Darwin has described the preservation of trees in Van Diemen’s land
    by means of calcareous substances. In speaking of beds of blown sand
    containing branches and roots of trees he says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The whole became consolidated by the percolation of calcareous
      matter; and the cylindrical cavities left by the decaying of the
      wood were thus also filled up with a hard pseudo-stalactitical
      stone. The weather is now wearing away the softer parts, and in
      consequence the hard casts of the roots and branches of the trees
      project above the surface, and, in a singularly deceptive manner,
      resemble the stumps of a dead thicket<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As a somewhat analogous method of preservation to that in travertine,
    the occurrence of plants in amber should be mentioned. In Eocene times
    there existed over a region, part of which is now the North-east
    German coast, an extensive forest of conifers and other trees. Some
    of the conifers were rich in resinous secretions which were poured
    out from wounded surfaces or from scars left by falling branches.
    As these flowed as a sticky mass over the stem or collected on the
    ground, flowers, leaves, and twigs blown by the wind or falling from
    the trees, became embedded in the exuded resin. Evaporation gradually
    hardened the resinous substance until the plant fragments became
    sealed up in a mass of amber, in precisely the same manner in which
    objects are artificially preserved in Canada balsam. In many cases the
    amber acts as a petrifying agent, and by penetrating the tissues of a
    piece of wood it preserves the minute structural details in wonderful
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>perfection<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. Dr Thomas in an account of the amber beds of East
    Prussia in 1848, refers to the occurrence of large fossil trees; he
    writes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The continuous changes to which the coast is exposed, often bring
      to light enormous trunks of trees, which the common people had
      long regarded as the trunks of the amber tree, before the learned
      declared that they were the stems of palm trees, and in consequence
      determined the position of Paradise to be on the coast of East
      Prussia<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="sidenote">CASTS OF TREES.</div>

  <p>In 1887 an enormous fossil plant was discovered in a sandstone quarry
    at Clayton near Bradford<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. The fossil was in the form of a sandstone
    cast of a large and repeatedly branched <i>Stigmaria</i>, and it is
    now in the Owens College Museum, where it was placed through the
    instrumentality of Prof. Williamson. The plant was found spread out
    in its natural position on the surface of an arenaceous shale, and
    overlain by a bed of hard sandstone identical with the material of
    which the cast is composed. Williamson has thus described the manner of
    formation of the fossil:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“It is obvious that the entire base of the tree became encased in a
      plastic material, which was firmly moulded upon these roots whilst
      the latter retained their organisation sufficiently unaltered to
      enable them to resist all superincumbent pressure. This external
      mould then hardened firmly, and as the organic materials decayed
      they were floated out by water which entered the branching cavity;
      at a still later period the same water was instrumental in
      replacing the carbonaceous elements by the sand of which the entire
      structure now consists<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Although the branches have not been preserved for their whole length,
    they extend a distance of 29 feet 6 inches from right to left, and 28
    feet in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>The fossil represented in fig. 1 (p. 10), from the collection of Dr
    John Woodward, affords a good example of a well-defined impression.
    The surface of the specimen, of which a cast is represented in fig. 1,
    shows very clearly the characteristic <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>leaf-cushions and leaf-scars of
    a <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The stem was embedded in soft sand, and as the
    latter became hard and set, an impression was obtained of the external
    markings of the <i>Lepidodendron</i>. Decay subsequently removed the
    substance of the plant.</p>

  <p>In fig. 11 some upright stems of a fossil Horse-tail (<i>Equisetites
    columnaris</i>) from the Lower Oolite rocks near Scarborough, are seen
    in a vertical position in sandstone. On the surface of the fossils
    there is a thin film of carbonaceous matter, which is all that remains
    of the original plant substance; the stems were probably floated into
    their present position and embedded vertically in an arenaceous matrix.
    The hollow pith-cavity was filled with sand, and as the tissues decayed
    they became in part converted into a thin coaly layer. The vertical
    position of such stems as those in fig. 11 naturally suggests their
    preservation <i>in situ</i>, but in this as in many other cases the
    erect manner of occurrence is due to the settling down of the drifted
    plants in this particular position.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">FOSSIL CASTS.</div>

  <p>An example of <i>Stigmaria</i> drawn in fig. 12 further illustrates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
    the formation of casts<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. The outer surface with the characteristic
    spirally arranged circular depressions, represents the wrinkled bark of
    the dried plant; the smaller cylinder, on the left side of the upper
    end (fig. 12, 2, <i>p</i>) marks the position of the pith surrounded by
    the secondary wood, which has been displaced from its axial position.
    The pith decayed first, and the space was filled in with mud; somewhat
    later the wood and cortex were partially destroyed, and the rod of
    material which had been introduced into the pith-cavity dropped towards
    one side of the decaying shell of bark.</p>

  <p>As the parenchymatous medullary rays readily decayed, the mud in
    the pith extended outwards between the segments of wood which still
    remained intact, and so spokes of argillaceous material were formed
    which filled the medullary ray cavities. The cortical tissues were
    decomposed, and their place taken by more argillaceous material. At one
    end of the specimen (fig. 12, 3) we find the wood has decayed without
    its place being afterwards filled up with foreign material. At the
    opposite <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>end of the specimen, the woody tissue has been partially
    preserved by the infiltration of a solution containing carbonate of
    lime (fig. 12, 2).</p>

  <p>Numerous instances have been recorded from rocks of various geological
    ages of casts of stems standing erect and at right angles to the
    bedding of the surrounding rock. These vertical trees occasionally
    attain a considerable length, and have been formed by the filling
    in by sand or mud of a pipe left by the decay of the stem. It is
    frequently a matter of some difficulty to decide how far such fossils
    are in the position of growth of the tree, or whether they are merely
    casts of drifted stems, which happen to have been deposited in an
    erect position. The weighting of floating trees by stones held in the
    roots, added to the greater density of the root wood, has no doubt
    often been the cause of this vertical position. In attempting to
    determine if an erect cast is in the original place of growth of the
    tree, it is important to bear in mind the great length of time that
    wood is able to resist decay, especially under water. The wonderful
    state of preservation of old piles found in the bed of a river, and
    the preservation of wooden portions of anchors of which the iron has
    been completely removed by disintegration, illustrate this power of
    resistance. In this connection, the following passage from Lyell’s
    travels in America is of interest. In describing the site of an old
    forest, he writes<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Some of the stumps, especially those of the fir tribe, take fifty
      years to rot away, though exposed in the air to alternations of
      rain and sunshine, a fact on which every geologist will do well
      to reflect, for it is clear that the trees of a forest submerged
      beneath the water, or still more, if entirely excluded from the
      air, by becoming imbedded in sediment, may endure for centuries
      without decay, so that there may have been ample time for the slow
      petrifaction of erect fossil trees in the Carboniferous and other
      formations, or for the slow accumulation around them of a great
      succession of strata.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In another place, in speaking of the trees in the Great Dismal Swamp,
    Lyell writes:—“When thrown down, they are soon covered by water,
    and keeping wet they never decompose, except the sap wood, which is
    less than an inch thick<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.” We <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>see, then, that trees may have
    resisted decay for a sufficiently long time to allow of a considerable
    deposition of sediment. It is very difficult to make any computation of
    the rate of deposition of a particular set of sedimentary strata, and,
    therefore, to estimate the length of time during which the fossil stems
    must have resisted decay.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PLANTS AND COAL.</div>

  <p>The protective qualities of humus acids, apart from the almost complete
    absence of Bacteria<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> from the waters of Moor- or Peat-land, is a
    factor of great importance in the preservation of plants against decay
    for many thousands of years.</p>

  <p>From examples of fossil stems or leaves in which the organic material
    has been either wholly or in part replaced by coal, we may pass by a
    gradual transition to a mass of opaque coal in which no plant structure
    can be detected. It is by no means uncommon to notice on the face of
    a piece of coal a distinct impression of a plant stem, and in some
    cases the coal is obviously made up of a number of flattened and
    compressed branches or leaves of which the original tissues have been
    thoroughly carbonised. A block of French coal, represented in fig.
    13, consists very largely of laminated bands composed of the long
    parallel veined leaves of the genus <i>Cordaites</i> and of the bark of
    <i>Lepidodendron</i>, <i>Sigillaria</i>, and other Coal-Measure genera.
    The long rhizomes and roots below the coal are preserved as casts in
    the underclay.</p>

  <p>In examining thin sections of coal, pieces of pitted tracheids or
    crushed spores are frequently met with as fragments of plant structures
    which have withstood decay more effectually than the bulk of the
    vegetable débris from which the coal was formed.</p>

  <p>The coaly layer on a fossil leaf is often found to be without any trace
    of the plant tissues, but not infrequently such carbonised leaves, if
    treated with certain reagents and examined microscopically, are seen
    to retain the outlines of the epidermal cells of the leaf surface. If
    a piece of the Carbonaceous film detached from a fossil leaf is left
    for some days in a small quantity of nitric acid containing a crystal
    of chlorate of potash, and, after washing with water, is transferred
    to ammonia, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>transparent film often shows very clearly the outlines
    of the epidermal cell and the form of the stomata. Such treatment has
    been found useful in many cases as an aid to determination<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. Prof.
    Zeiller informs me that he has found it particularly satisfactory in
    the case of cycadean leaves.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">FOSSILS IN HALF-RELIEF.</div>

  <p>It is sometimes possible to detach the thin lamina representing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> the
    carbonised leaf or other plant fragment from the rock on which it lies
    and to mount it whole on a slide. Good examples of plants treated in
    this way may be seen in the Edinburgh and British Museums, especially
    <i>Sphenopteris</i> fronds from the Carboniferous oil shales of
    Scotland. In the excellent collection of fossil plants in Stockholm
    there are still finer examples of such specimens, obtained by Dr
    Nathorst from some of the Triassic plants of Southern Sweden. In a few
    instances the tissues of a plant have been converted into coal in such
    a manner as to retain the form of the individual cells, which appear in
    section as a black framework in a lighter coloured matrix. Examples of
    such carbonised tissues were figured by some of the older writers, and
    Solms-Laubach has recently<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> described sections of Palaeozoic plants
    preserved in this manner. The section represented in fig. 70 is that
    of a Calamite stem (8 × 9·5 cm.) in which the wood has been converted
    into carbonaceous material, but the more delicate tissues have been
    almost completely destroyed. The thin and irregular black line a
    little distance outside the ring of wood, and forming the limit of the
    drawing, probably represents the cuticle. The whole section is embedded
    in a homogeneous matrix of calcareous rock, in which the more resistant
    tissues of the plant have been left as black patches and faint lines.</p>

  <p>Mention should be made of a special form of preservation which has been
    described as fossilisation in half-relief. If a stem is imbedded in
    sand or mud, the matrix receives an impression of the plant surface,
    and if the hollow pith-cavity is filled with the surrounding sediment,
    the surface of the medullary cast will exhibit markings different from
    those seen on the surface in contact with the outside of the stem. The
    space separating the pith-cast from the mould bearing the impression of
    the stem surface may remain empty, or it may be filled with sedimentary
    material. In half-relief fossils, on the other hand, we have projecting
    from the under surface of a bed a more or less rounded and prominent
    ridge with certain surface markings, and fitting into a corresponding
    groove in the underlying rock on which the same markings have been
    impressed. It is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>conceivable that such a cast might be obtained if
    soft plant fragments were lying on a bed of sand, and were pressed into
    it by the weight of superincumbent material. The plant fragment would
    be squeezed into a depression, and its substance might eventually be
    removed and leave no other trace than the half-relief cast and hollow
    mould. A twig lying on sand would by its own weight gradually sink a
    little below the surface; if it were then blown away or in some manner
    removed, the depression would show the surface features of the twig.
    When more sand came to be spread out over the depression, it would
    find its way into the pattern of the mould, and so produce a cast. If
    at a later period when the sand had hardened, the upper portion were
    separated from the lower, from the former there would project a rounded
    cast of the hollow mould. The preservation of soft algae as half-relief
    casts has been doubted by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and others as an unlikely
    occurrence in nature. They prefer to regard such ridges on a rock face
    as the casts of the trails or burrows of animals. This question of the
    preservation of the two sides of a mould showing the same impression
    of a plant has long been a difficult problem; it is discussed by
    Parkinson in his <cite>Organic Remains</cite>. In one of the letters (No.
    <span class="allsmcap">XLVI.</span>), he quotes the objection of a sceptical friend, who
    refuses to believe such a manner of preservation possible, “until,”
    says Parkinson, “I can inform him if, by involving a guinea in plaster
    of Paris, I could obtain two impressions of the king’s head, without
    any impression of the reverse<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.”</p>

  <p>It would occupy too much space to attempt even a brief reference to the
    various materials in which impressions of plants have been preserved.
    Carbonaceous matter is the most usual substance, and in some cases
    it occurs in the form of graphite which on dark grey or black rocks
    has the appearance of a plant drawn in lead pencil. The impressions
    of plants on the Jurassic (Kimeridgian) slates of Solenhofen<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> in
    Bavaria, like those on the Triassic sandstones of the Vosges, are
    usually marked out in red iron oxide.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">PETRIFIED TREES.</div>

  <p>So far we have chiefly considered examples of plants preserved in
    various ways by <em>incrustation</em>, that is, by having been enclosed
    in some medium which has received an impression of the surface of the
    plant in contact with it. By far the most valuable fossil specimens
    from a botanical point of view are however those in which the internal
    structure has been preserved; that is in which the preserving medium
    has not served merely as an encasing envelope or internal cast, but has
    penetrated into the body of the plant fragment and rendered permanent
    the organization of the tissues. In almost every Natural History or
    Geological Museum one meets with specimens of petrified trees or
    polished sections of fossil palm stems and other plants, in which
    the internal structure has been preserved in siliceous material, and
    admits of detailed investigation in thin sections under the microscope.
    Silica, calcium carbonate, with usually a certain amount of carbonate
    of iron and magnesium carbonate, iron pyrites, amber, and more rarely
    calcium fluoride or other substances have taken the place of the
    original cell-walls. Of silicified stems, those from Antigua, Egypt,
    Central France, Saxony, Brazil, Tasmania<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>, and numerous other
    places afford good examples. Darwin records numerous silicified stems
    in Northern Chili, and the Uspallata Pass. In the central part of the
    Andes range, 7000 feet high, he describes the occurrence of “Snow-white
    projecting silicified columns.... They must have grown,” he adds, “in
    volcanic soil, and were subsequently submerged below sea-level, and
    covered with sedimentary beds and lava-flows<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.” A striking example
    of the occurrence of numerous petrified plant stems has been described
    by Holmes from the Tertiary forests of the Yellowstone Park. From
    the face of a cliff on the north side of Amethyst mountain “rows of
    upright trunks stand out on the ledges like the columns of a ruined
    temple. On the more gentle slopes farther down, but where it is still
    too steep to support vegetation, save a few pines, the petrified
    trunks fairly cover the surface, and were at first supposed by us to
    be the shattered remains of a recent forest<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.” Marsh<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>Conwentz<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> have described silicified trees more than fifty feet
    in length from a locality in California where several large forest
    trees of Tertiary age have been preserved in volcanic strata. In South
    Africa on the Drakenberg hills there occur numerous silicified trunks,
    occasionally erect and often lying on the ground, probably of Triassic
    age<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. In some instances the specimens measure several feet in
    length and diameter. Some of the coniferous stems seen in Portland, and
    occasionally met with reared up against a house side, illustrate the
    silicification of plant structure on a large scale. These are of Upper
    Jurassic (Purbeck) age. From Grand’Croix in France a silicified stem of
    <i>Cordaites</i> of Palaeozoic age has been recorded with a length of
    twenty meters. The preservation of plants by siliceous infiltrations
    has long been known. One of the earliest descriptions of this form
    of petrifaction in the British Isles is that of stems found in Lough
    Neagh, Ireland. In his lectures on Natural Philosophy, published at
    Dublin in 1751, Barton gives several figures of Irish silicified wood,
    and records the following occurrence in illustration of the peculiar
    properties erroneously attributed to the waters of Lough Neagh.
    Describing a certain specimen (No. <span class="allsmcap">XXVI</span>), he writes:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“This is a whetstone, which as Mr Anthony Shane, apothecary, who
      was born very near the lake, and is now alive, relates, he made by
      putting a piece of holly in the water of the lake near his father’s
      house, and fixing it so as to withstand the motion of the water,
      and marking the place so as to distinguish it, he went to Scotland
      to pursue his studies, and seven years after took up a stone
      instead of holly, the metamorphosis having been made in that time.
      This account he gave under his handwriting. The shore thereabouts
      is altogether loose sand, and two rivers discharge themselves into
      the lake very near that place<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The well-known petrified trees from the neighbourhood of Lough Neagh
    are probably of Pliocene age, but their exact source has been a matter
    of dispute<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PETRIFIED WOOD.</div>

  <p>In 1836 Stokes described certain stems in which the tissues had been
    partially mineralised. In describing a specimen of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>beech from a Roman
    aqueduct at Eibsen in Lippe Bückeburg], he says:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The wood is, for the most part, in the state of very old dry wood,
      but there are several insulated portions, in which the place of the
      wood has been taken by carbonate of lime. These portions, as seen
      on the surface of the horizontal section, are irregularly circular,
      varying in size, but generally a little less or more than ⅛ inch in
      diameter, and they run through the whole thickness of the specimen
      in separate, perpendicular columns. The vessels of the wood are
      distinctly visible in the carbonate of lime, and are more perfect
      in their form and size in those portions of the specimen than in
      that which remains unchanged<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.”</p>

  <p>This partial petrifaction of the structure in patches is often met with
    in fossil stems, and may be seriously misleading to those unfamiliar
    with the appearance presented by the crystallisation of silica from
    scattered centres in a mass of vegetable tissue. A good example of
    this is afforded by the gigantic stems discovered in 1829 in the
    Craigleith Quarry near Edinburgh<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. Of those two large stems found
    in the Sandstone rock, the longest, originally 11 meters long and
    3·3–3·9 meters in girth, is now set up in the grounds of the British
    Museum, and a large polished section (1 m. × 87 cm.) is exhibited in
    the Fossil-plant Gallery. The other stem is in the Botanic Garden,
    Edinburgh. Transverse sections of the wood of the London <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>specimen show
    scattered circular patches (fig. 14 A) in the mineralised wood in which
    the tracheids are very clearly preserved; while in the other portion
    the preservation is much less perfect. The patch of tissue in fig. 14 A
    shows a portion of the wood of the Craigleith tree [<i>Araucarioxylon
    Withami</i> (L. and H.)] in which the mineral matter, consisting of
    dolomite with a little silica here and there, has crystallised in such
    a manner as to produce what is practically a cone-in-cone structure
    on a small scale, which has partially obliterated the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> structural
    features. This minute cone-in-cone structure is not uncommon in
    petrified tissues; it is precisely similar in appearance to that
    described by Cole<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> in certain minerals. The crystallisation has
    been set up along lines radiating from different centres, and the
    particles of the tissue have been pushed as it were along these lines.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PRESERVATION OF TISSUES.</div>

  <p>A somewhat different crystallisation phenomenon is illustrated by the
    extremely fine section of a Lepidodendroid plant shown in fig. 15. The
    tissues of the primary and secondary wood (<i>x</i><sup>1</sup> and <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>)
    are well preserved throughout in silica, but scattered through the
    siliceous matrix there occur numerous circular patches, as seen in the
    figure. One of these is more clearly shown in fig. 14 B drawn from a
    longitudinal section through the secondary wood, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>; it will be
    noticed that where the concentric lines of the circular patch occur,
    the scalariform thickenings of the tracheids are sharply defined, but
    immediately a tracheid is free of the patch these details are lost.
    It would appear that in this case silicification was first completed
    round definite isolated centres, and the secondary crystallisation in
    the matrix partially obliterated some of the more delicate structural
    features. The same phenomenon has been observed in oolitic rocks<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>,
    in which the oolitic grains have resisted secondary crystallisation and
    so retained their original structure.</p>

  <p>Among the most important examples of silicified plants are those from
    a few localities in Central France. In the neighbourhood of Autun
    there used to be found in abundance loose nodules of siliceous rock
    containing numerous fragments of seeds, twigs, and leaves of different
    plants. The rock of which the broken portions are found on the surface
    of the ground was formed about the close of the Carboniferous period.</p>

  <p>At the hands of French investigators the microscopic examination of
    these fragments of a Palaeozoic vegetation have thrown a flood of
    light on the anatomical structure of many extinct types. Sometimes the
    silica has penetrated the cavities of the cells and vessels, and the
    walls have decayed without their substance being replaced by mineral
    material. Sections of tissues preserved in this manner, if soaked in a
    coloured <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>solution assume an appearance almost identical with that of
    stained sections of recent plants. The spaces left by the decayed walls
    act as fine capillaries and suck up the coloured solution<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.</p>

  <p>In the Coal-Measure sandstones of England large pieces of woody
    stems are occasionally met with in which the mineralisation has been
    incomplete. A brown piece of fossil stem lying in a bed of sandstone
    shows on the surface a distinct woody texture, and the lines of wood
    elements are clearly visible. The whole is, however, very friable and
    falls to pieces if an attempt is made to cut thin sections of it;
    the tracheids of the wood easily fall apart owing to the walls being
    imperfectly preserved, and the absence of a connecting framework
    such as would have been formed had the membranes been thoroughly
    silicified. It is occasionally possible to obtain from petrified plant
    stems perfect casts in silica or other substances of the cavity of
    a sclerenchymatous fibre, in which the mineral has been deposited
    not only in the cavity but in the fine pit-canals traversing the
    lignified walls. Such a cast is represented in fig. 16, the fine
    lateral projections are the delicate casts of the pit canals. Numerous
    instances of minute and delicate tissues preserved in silica are
    recorded in later chapters. A somewhat unusual type of silicification
    is met with in some of the Gondwana rocks of India, in which cycadean
    fronds occur as white porcellaneous specimens showing a certain amount
    of internal structure in a siliceous matrix. Specimens of such leaves
    may be seen in the British Museum.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">COAL-BALLS.</div>

  <p>In the Coal-Measures of England, especially in the neighbourhood of
    Halifax in Yorkshire, and in South Lancashire, the seams of coal
    occasionally contain calcareous nodules varying in size from a nut to
    a man’s head, and consisting of about 70% of carbonate of calcium and
    magnesium, and 30% of oxide of iron, sulphide of iron, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The
    nodules, often spoken of by English writers as ‘coal-balls,’ contain
    numerous fragments of plants in which the minute cellular structure is
    preserved with remarkable perfection. It should be noted that the term
    coal-ball is also applied to rounded or subangular pieces of coal which
    are occasionally met with in coal seams, and especially in certain
    French coal fields. To avoid confusion it is better to speak of the
    plant-containing nodules as calcareous nodules, restricting the term
    coal-ball to true coal pebbles. A section <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>of a calcareous nodule, when
    seen under the microscope, presents the appearance of a matrix of a
    crystalline calcareous substance containing a heterogeneous mixture of
    all kinds of plant tissues, usually in the form of broken pieces and in
    a confused mass.</p>

  <p>A large section of one of these nodules (12·5 cm. × 8·5 cm.) is
    shown in fig. 17. It illustrates the manner of occurrence of various
    fragments of different plants in which the structure has been more or
    less perfectly preserved. In this particular example we see sections
    of <i>Myeloxylon</i> (I), <i>Calamites</i> (II), Fern petioles
    (<i>Rachiopteris</i>) (III), Stigmarian appendages (IV), Lepidodendroid
    leaves (V), <i>Myeloxylon</i> pinnules (VI), Gymnospermous seeds (VII),
    Twig of a <i>Lepidodendron</i>, showing the central xylem cylinder and
    large leaf-bases on the outer cortex, (VIII), Sporangia and spores of a
    strobilus (IX), Tangential section of a <i>Myeloxylon</i> petiole (X),
    <i>Rachiopteris</i> sp. (XI), <i>Rachiopteris</i> sp. (XII), Band of
    sclerenchymatous tissue (XIII), <i>Rachiopteris</i> sp. (XIV).</p>

  <p>The general appearance of a calcareous plant-nodule suggests a soft
    pulpy mass of decaying vegetable débris, through which roots were able
    to bore their way, as in a piece of peat or leafy mould. Overlying
    this accumulation of soft material there was spread out a bed of muddy
    sediment containing numerous calcareous shells, which supplied the
    percolating water with the material which was afterwards deposited in
    portions of the vegetable débris. According to this view the calcareous
    nodules of the coal seams represent local patches of a widespread
    mass of débris which were penetrated by a carbonated solution, and so
    preserved as samples of a decaying mass of vegetation, of which by far
    the greater portion became eventually converted into coal<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">FOSSIL NUCLEI.</div>

  <p>In such nodules, we find that not only has the framework of the tissues
    been preserved, but frequently the remains of cell contents are clearly
    seen. In some cases the cells of a tissue may contain in each cavity a
    darker coloured spot, which is probably the mineralised cell nucleus.
    (Fig. 42, <i>A</i>, 1, p. 214.) The contents of secretory sacs, such
    as those containing gum or resin, are frequently found as black rods
    filling up the cavity of the cell <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>or canal. The contents of cells
    in some cases closely simulate starch grains, and such may have been
    actually present in the tissues of a piece of a fossil dicotyledonous
    stem described by Thiselton-Dyer from the Lower Eocene Thanet
    beds<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>, and in the rhizome of a fossil <i>Osmunda</i> recorded by
    Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. (Fig. 42, <i>B</i>, p. 214.)</p>

  <p>Schultze in 1855<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> recorded the discovery of cellulose by
    microchemical tests applied to macerated tissue from Tertiary lignite
    and coal. With reference to the possibility of recognising cell
    contents in fossil tissue it is interesting to find that Dr Murray
    of Scarborough had attempted, and apparently with success, to apply
    chemical tests to the tissues of Jurassic leaves. In a letter written
    to Hutton in 1833 Murray speaks of his experiments as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Reverting to the Oolitic plants, I have again and with
      better success been experimenting upon the thin transparent
      films of leaves, chiefly of <i>Taeniopteris vittata</i> and
      <i>Cyclopteris</i>, which from their tenuity offer fine objects
      for the microscope.... By many delicate trials I have ascertained
      the existence still in these leaves of resin and of tannin.... I
      am seeking among the filmy leaves of the <i>Fucoides</i> of A.
      Brongniart for iodine, but hitherto without success, and indeed can
      hardly expect it, as probably did iodine exist in them, it must
      have long ago entered into new combinations<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Apart from this difficulty, it is not surprising that Dr Murray’s
    search for iodine was unsuccessful, considering how little algal nature
    most of the so-called Fucoids possess.</p>

  <p>Some of the most perfectly preserved tissues as regards the details
    of cell contents are those of gymnospermous seeds from Autun. In
    sections of one of these seeds which I recently had the opportunity
    of examining in Prof. Bertrand’s collection, the parenchymatous cells
    contained very distinct nuclei and protoplasmic contents. In one
    portion of the tissue in the nucellus of <i>Sphaerospermum</i> the
    cell walls had disappeared, but the nuclei remained in a remarkable
    state of preservation. The cells shown in fig. 42 are from the ground
    tissue of a petiole of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span><i>Cycadeoidea gigantea</i> Sew.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>, a
    magnificent Cycadean stem from Portland recently added to the British
    Museum collection; in the cell <i>A</i>, 1, the nucleus is fairly
    distinct and in 2 and 4 the contracted cell-contents is clearly
    seen. Other interesting examples of fossil nuclei are seen in a
    <i>Lyginodendron</i> leaf figured by Williamson and Scott in a recent
    Memoir on that genus<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. Each mesophyll cell contains a single dark
    nucleus. The mineralisation of the most delicate tissues and the
    preservation of the various forms of cell-contents are now generally
    admitted by those at all conversant with the possibilities of plant
    petrifaction. If we consider what these facts mean—the microscopic
    investigation of not only the finest framework but even the very
    life-substance of Palaeozoic plants—we feel that the aeons since the
    days when these plants lived have been well-nigh obliterated.</p>

  <p>Occasionally the plant tissues have assumed a black and somewhat ragged
    appearance, giving the impression of charred wood. A section of a
    recent burnt piece of wood resembles very closely some of the fossil
    twigs from the coal seam nodules. It is possible that in such cases we
    have portions of mineralised tissues which were first burnt in a forest
    fire or by lightning and then infiltrated with a petrifying solution.
    An example of one of these black petrified plants is shown in fig. 74
    B. Chap. <span class="allsmcap">X.</span> In many of the fossil plants there are distinct
    traces of fungus or bacterial ravages, and occasionally the section of
    a piece of mineralised wood shows circular spaces or canals which have
    the appearance of being the work of some wood-eating animal, and small
    oval bodies sometimes occur in such spaces which may be the coprolites
    of the xylophagous intruder. (Fig. 24, p. 107.)</p>

  <div class="sidenote">FOSSIL PLANTS IN VOLCANIC ASH.</div>

  <p>It is well known to geologists that during the Permian and
    Carboniferous periods the southern portion of Scotland was the scene of
    widespread volcanic activity. Forests were overwhelmed by lava-streams
    or showers of ash, and in some districts tree stems and broken plant
    fragments became sealed up in a volcanic matrix. Laggan Bay in the
    north-east corner of the Isle of Arran, and Pettycur a short distance
    from Burntisland on the north shore of the Firth of Forth, are two
    localities where <span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>petrified plants of Carboniferous age occur in such
    preservation as allows of a minute investigation of their internal
    structure. The occurrence of plants in the former locality was first
    discovered by Mr Wünsch of Glasgow; the fossils occur in association
    with hardened shales and beds of ash, and are often exceedingly well
    preserved<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. In fig. 18 is reproduced a sketch of a hollow tree
    trunk from Arran, probably a <i>Lepidodendron</i> stem, in which only
    the outer portion of the bark has been preserved, while the inner
    cortical tissues have been removed and the space occupied by volcanic
    detritus.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter">
    <img class="illowp75" src="images/fig18.jpg" alt="" id="fig18" />
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 18. Diagrammatic sketch of a slab cut from a fossil
      stem (<i>Lepidodendron</i>?) from Laggan Bay. <i>e</i>,
      Imperfectly preserved bark of a large stem, extending in
      patches round the periphery of the specimen; the oval and
      circular bodies in the interior are the xylem portions of the
      central cylinders of <i>Lepidodendron</i> stems, <i>x</i><sup>1</sup>,
      primary wood, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, secondary wood. From a specimen in
      the Binney collection, Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge. ⅕ nat. size.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The smaller cylindrical structures in the interior of the hollow trunk
    are the central woody cylinders of Lepidodendroid trees; each consists
    of an axial pith surrounded by a band of primary wood and a broader
    zone of secondary wood. One of the axes probably belonged to the stem
    of which only the shell has been preserved, the others must have come
    from other <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>trees and may have been floated in by water<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. The
    microscopic details of the wood and outer cortex have in this instance
    been preserved in a calcareous material, which was no doubt derived by
    water percolating through the volcanic ash. It is frequently found that
    in fossil trees or twigs a separation of the tissues has taken place
    along such natural lines of weakness as the cambium or the phellogen,
    before the petrifying medium had time to permeate the entire structure.
    Tree stems recently killed by lava streams during volcanic eruptions at
    the present day supply a parallel with the Palaeozoic forest trees of
    Carboniferous times.</p>

  <p>Guillemard in describing a volcanic crater in Celebes, speaks of burnt
    trees still standing in the lava stream, “so charred at the base of the
    trunk that we could easily push them down<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.” An interesting case
    is quoted by Hooker in his <cite>Himalayan Journals</cite>, illustrating the
    occurrence of a hollow shell of a tree, in which the outer portions of
    a stem had been left while the inner portions had disappeared, the wood
    being hollow and so favourable to the production of a current of air
    which accelerated the destruction of the internal tissues.</p>

  <p>On the coast near Burntisland on the Firth of Forth blocks of rock are
    met with in which numerous plant fragments of Carboniferous age are
    scattered in a confused mass through a calcareous volcanic matrix. The
    twigs, leaves, spores, and other portions are in small fragments, and
    their delicate cells are often preserved in wonderful perfection.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">CONDITIONS OF PRESERVATION.</div>

  <p>The manner of occurrence of plants in sandstones, shales or other rocks
    is often of considerable importance to the botanist and geologist, as
    an aid to the correct interpretation of the actual conditions which
    obtained at the time when the plant remains were accumulating in beds
    of sediment. To attempt to restore the conditions under which any
    set of plants became preserved, we have to carefully consider each
    special case. A nest of seeds preserved as internal casts in a mass
    of sandstone, such as is represented by the block of Carboniferous
    sandstone in fig. 19, suggests a quiet spot in an eddy where <span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>seeds
    were deposited in the sandy sediment. Delicate leaf structures with
    sporangia still intact, point to quietly flowing water and a transport
    of no great distance. Occasionally the large number of delicate and
    light plant fragments, associated it may be with insect wings, may
    favour the idea of a wind storm which swept along the lighter pieces
    from a forest-clad slope and deposited them in the water of a lake. In
    some Tertiary plant-beds the manner of occurrence of leaves and flowers
    is such as to suggest a seasonal alternation, and the different layers
    of plant débris may be correlated with definite seasons of growth<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 19. Piece of Coal-Measures Sandstone with casts of
      <i>Trigonocarpon</i> seeds, from Peel Quarry near Wigan. From a
      specimen in the Manchester Museum, Owens College. ½ nat. size.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The predominance of certain classes of plants in a particular bed may
    be due to purely mechanical causes and to differential sorting by
    water, or it may be that the district traversed by the stream which
    carried down the fragments was occupied almost exclusively by one set
    of plants. The trees from higher ground may be deposited in a different
    part of a river’s course to those growing in the plains or lowland
    marshes. It is obviously impossible to lay down any definite rules
    as to the reading of plant records, as aids to the elucidation of
    past physical and botanical conditions. Each case must be separately
    considered, and the various probabilities taken into account, judging
    by reference to the analogy of present day conditions.</p>

  <p>Various attempts, more or less successful, have been made <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>to imitate
    the natural processes of plant mineralisation<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. By soaking sections
    of wood for some time in different solutions, and then exposing them
    to heat, the organic substance of the cell walls has been replaced by
    a deposit of oxide of iron and other substances. Fern leaves heated to
    redness between pieces of shale have been reduced to a condition very
    similar to that of fossil fronds. Pieces of wood left for centuries
    in disused mines have been found in a state closely resembling
    lignite<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. Attempts have also been made to reproduce the conditions
    under which vegetable tissues were converted into coal, but as yet
    these have not yielded results of much scientific value. The Geysers
    of Yellowstone Park have thrown some light on the manner in which wood
    may be petrified by the percolation of siliceous solutions; and it has
    been suggested that the silicification of plants may have been effected
    by the waters of hot springs holding silica in solution. Examples of
    wood in process of petrifaction in the Geyser district of North America
    have been recorded by Kuntze<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>, and discussed by Schweinfurth<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>,
    Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and others<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. The latter expresses the opinion
    that by a long continuance of such action as may now be observed in the
    neighbourhood of hot springs, the organic substance of wood might be
    replaced by siliceous material. The exact manner of replacement needs
    more thorough investigation. Kuntze describes the appearance of forest
    trees which have been reached by the waters of neighbouring Geysers.
    The siliceous solution rises in the wood by capillarity; the leaves,
    branches and bark are gradually lost, and the outer tissues of the
    wood become hardened and petrified as the result of evaporation from
    the exposed surface of the stem. The products of decay going on in the
    plant tissues must be taken into account, and the double decomposition
    which might result. There is no apparent reason why experiments
    undertaken with pieces of recent wood exposed to permeation by various
    calcareous and siliceous solutions under different conditions should
    not furnish useful results.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="clear"><span class="smcap">The</span> student of palaeobotany has perhaps to face more than his due
    share of difficulties and fruitful sources of error; but on the other
    hand there is the compensating advantage that trustworthy conclusions
    arrived at possess a special value. While always on the alert for
    rational explanations of obscure phenomena by means of the analogy
    supplied by existing causes, and ready to draw from a wide knowledge of
    recent botany, in the interpretation of problems furnished by fossil
    plants, the palaeobotanist must be constantly alive to the necessity
    for cautious statement. That there is the greatest need of moderation
    and safe reasoning in dealing with the botanical problems of past ages,
    will be apparent to anyone possessing but a superficial acquaintance
    with fossil plant literature. The necessity for a botanical and
    geological training has already been referred to in a previous chapter.</p>

  <p>It would serve no useful purpose, and would occupy no inconsiderable
    space, to refer at length to the numerous mistakes which have been
    committed by experienced writers on the subject of fossil plants.
    Laymen might find in such a list of blunders a mere comedy of errors,
    but the palaeobotanist must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> see in them serious warnings against
    dogmatic conclusions or expressions of opinion on imperfect data and
    insufficient evidence. The description of a fragment of a handle of
    a Wedgwood teapot as a curious form of Calamite<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and similar
    instances of unusual determinations need not detain us as examples of
    instructive errors. The late Prof. Williamson has on more than one
    occasion expressed himself in no undecided manner as to the futility of
    attempting to determine specific forms among fossil plants, without the
    aid of internal structure<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>; and even in the case of well-preserved
    petrifactions he always refused to commit himself to definite specific
    diagnoses. In his remarks in this connection, Williamson no doubt
    allowed himself to express a much needed warning in too sweeping
    language. It is one of the most serious drawbacks in palaeobotanical
    researches that in the majority of cases the specimens of plants are
    both fragmentary and without any trace of internal structure. Specimens
    in which the anatomical characters have been preserved necessarily
    possess far greater value from the botanist’s point of view than
    those in which no such petrifaction has occurred. On the other hand,
    however, it is perfectly possible with due care to obtain trustworthy
    and valuable results from the examination of structureless casts and
    impressions. In dealing with the less promising forms of plant fossils,
    there is in the first place the danger of trusting to superficial
    resemblance. Hundreds of fossil plants have been described under the
    names of existing genera on the strength of a supposed agreement
    in external form; but such determinations are very frequently not
    only valueless but dangerously misleading. Unless the evidence is
    of the best, it is a serious mistake to make use of recent generic
    designations. If we consider the difficulties which would attend an
    attempt to determine the leaves, fragments of stems and other detached
    portions of various recent genera, we can better appreciate the greater
    probability of error in the case of imperfectly preserved fossil
    fragments.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">EXTERNAL RESEMBLANCE.</div>

  <p>The portions of stems represented in figures 20 and 21, exhibit
    a fairly close resemblance to one another; in the absence <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>of
    microscopical sections or of the reproductive organs it would be
    practically impossible to discriminate with any certainty between
    fossil specimens of the plants shown in the drawings. Examples such as
    these, and many others which might be cited,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> serve to illustrate the
    possibility of confusion not merely between different genera of the
    same family, but even between members of different classes or groups.
    The long slender branches of the <i>Polygonum</i> represented in (fig.
    21) would naturally be referred to <i>Equisetum</i> in the absence of
    the flowers (fig. 20 <i>B</i>), or without a careful examination of
    the insignificant scaly leaves borne at the nodes. The resemblance
    between <i>Casuarina</i> and <i>Ephedra</i> and the British species of
    <i>Equisetum</i>, or such a tropical form as <i>E. debile</i>, speaks
    for itself.</p>

  <p>Endless examples might be quoted&#8288; illustrating the absolute futility,
    in many cases, of relying on external features even for the purpose
    of class distinction. An acquaintance with the general habit and
    appearance of only the better known members of a family, frequently
    leads to serious mistakes. The specimen shown in fig. 22 is a
    leaf of a tropical fern <i>Kaulfussia</i>, a genus now living in
    South-eastern Asia, and a member of one of the most important and
    interesting families of the Filicinæ, the Marrattiaceæ; its form is
    widely different from that which one is accustomed to associate with
    fern fronds. It is unlikely that the impression of a sterile leaf of
    <i>Kaulfussia</i> would be recognised as a portion of a fern plant.</p>

  <p>Similarly in another exceedingly important group of plants, the
    Cycadaceæ<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>, the examples usually met with in botanical gardens
    are quite insufficient as standards of comparison when we are dealing
    with fossil forms. Familiarity with a few commoner types leads us
    to regard them as typical for the whole family. In Mesozoic times
    cycadean plants were far more numerous and widely distributed than
    at the present time, and to adequately study the numerous fossil
    examples we need as thorough an acquaintance as possible with the
    comparatively small number of surviving genera and species. The less
    common and more isolated species of an existing family may often be
    of far greater importance to the palaeobotanist than the common and
    more typical forms. This importance of rare and little known types
    will be more fully illustrated in the chapters dealing with the
    Cycadaceæ and other plant groups. Among Dicotyledons, the Natural Order
    Proteaceæ, at present characteristic of South Africa and Australia,
    and also represented in South America and the Pacific Islands, is
    of considerable interest to the student of fossil Angiosperms. In a
    valuable address delivered before the Linnean Society<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> in 1870
    Bentham drew attention to the marked ‘protean’ character of the members
    of this family. He laid special stress on this particular division of
    the Dicotyledons in view of certain far-reaching conclusions, which had
    been based on the occurrence in different parts of Europe of fossil
    leaves supposed to be those of Proteaceous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>genera<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. Speaking of
    detached leaves, Bentham says:—“I do not know of a single one which,
    in outline or venation, is exclusively characteristic of the order, or
    of any one of its genera.” Species of <i>Grevillea</i>, <i>Hakea</i>
    and a few other genera are more or less familiar in plant houses, but
    the leaf-forms illustrated by the commoner members of the family convey
    no idea of the enormous variation which is met with not only in the
    family as a whole, but in the different species of the same genus. The
    striking diversity of leaf within the limits of a single genus will be
    dealt with more fully in volume <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> under the head of Fossil
    Dicotyledons.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">VENATION CHARACTERS.</div>

  <p>There is a common source of danger in attempting to carry too far
    the venation characters as tests of affinity. The parallel venation
    of Monocotyledons is by no means a safe guide to follow in all cases
    as a distinguishing feature of this class of plants. In addition to
    such leaves as those of the Gymnosperm <i>Cordaites</i> and detached
    pinnæ of Cycads, there are certain species of Dicotyledons which
    correspond in the character of their venation to Monocotyledonous
    leaves. <i>Eryngium montanum</i> Coult., <i>E. Lassauxi</i> Dcne., and
    other species of this genus of <i>Umbelliferæ</i> agree closely with
    such a plant as <i>Pandanus</i> or other Monocotyledons&#8288;; similarly
    the long linear leaves of <i>Richea dracophylla</i>, R. Br., one
    of the Ericaceæ, are identical in form with many monocotyledonous
    leaves. Instances might also be quoted of monocotyledonous leaves,
    such as species of <i>Smilax</i> and others which Lindley included in
    his family of Dictyogens which correspond closely with some types of
    Dicotyledons<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. Venation characters must be used with care even in
    determining classes or groups, and with still greater reserve if relied
    on as family or generic tests.</p>

  <p>It is too frequently the case that while we are conversant with the
    most detailed histological structure of a fossil plant stem, its
    external form is a matter of conjecture. The conditions which have
    favoured the petrifaction of plant tissues have as a rule not been
    favourable for the preservation of good casts or impressions of the
    external features; and, on the other hand, in the best impressions of
    fern fronds or other plants, in which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>the finest veins are clearly
    marked, there is no trace of internal structure. It is, however,
    frequently the case that a knowledge of the internal structure of
    a particular plant enables us to interpret certain features in
    a structureless cast which could not be understood without the
    help of histological facts. A particularly interesting example
    of anatomical knowledge affording a key to apparently abnormal
    peculiarities in a specimen preserved by incrustation, is afforded
    by the fructification of the genus <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. Some few
    years ago Williamson described in detail the structure of a fossil
    strobilus (<i>i.e.</i> cone) from the Coal-Measures, but owing to the
    isolated occurrence of the specimens he was unable to determine the
    plant to which the strobilus belonged. On re-examining some strobili
    of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, preserved by incrustation, in the light of
    Williamson’s descriptions, Zeiller was able to explain certain features
    in his specimens which had hitherto been a puzzle, and he demonstrated
    that Williamson’s cone was that of a <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. Similar
    examples might be quoted, but enough has been said to emphasize the
    importance of dealing as far as possible with both petrifactions and
    incrustations. The facts derived from a study of a plant in one form of
    preservation may enable us to interpret or to amplify the data afforded
    by specimens preserved in another form.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">DECORTICATED STEMS.</div>

  <p>The fact that plants usually occur in detached fragments, and that
    they have often been sorted by water, and that portions of the same
    plant have been embedded in sediment considerable distances apart,
    is a constant source of difficulty. Deciduous leaves, cones, or
    angiospermous flowers, and other portions of a plant which become
    naturally separated from the parent tree, are met with as detached
    specimens, and it is comparatively seldom that we have the necessary
    data for reuniting the isolated members. As the result of the partial
    decay and separation of portions of the same stem or branch, the
    wood and bark may be separately preserved. Darwin<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> describes
    how the bark often falls from <i>Eucalyptus</i> trees, and hangs in
    long shreds, which swing about in the wind, and give to the woods a
    desolate and untidy appearance. In the passage already quoted from the
    narrative <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>of the voyage of the Challenger, illustrations are afforded
    of the manner in which detached portions of plants are likely to be
    preserved in a fossil state. The epidermal layer of a leaf or the
    surface tissues of a twig may be detached from the underlying tissues
    and separately preserved<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. It is exceedingly common for a stem
    to be partially decorticated before preservation, and the appearance
    presented by a cast or impression of the surface of a woody cylinder,
    and by the same stem with a part or the whole of its cortex intact
    is strikingly different. The late Prof. Balfour<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> draws attention
    to this source of error in his text-book of palaeobotany, and gives
    figures illustrating the different appearance presented by a branch
    of <i>Araucaria imbricata</i> Pav. when seen with its bark intact and
    more or less decorticated. Specimens that are now recognised as casts
    of stems from which the cortex had been more or less completely removed
    before preservation, were originally described under distinct generic
    names, such as <i>Bergeria</i>, <i>Knorria</i> and others. These are
    now known to be imperfect examples of Sigillarian or Lepidodendroid
    plants. Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> quotes the bark of <i>Lepidodendron
    Veltheimianum</i> Presl. as a fossil which has been described under
    twenty-eight specific names, and placed in several genera.</p>

  <p>Since the microscopical examination of fossil plant-anatomy was
    rendered possible, a more correct interpretation of decorticated and
    incomplete specimens has been considerably facilitated. The examination
    of tangential sections taken at different levels in the cortex of
    such a plant as <i>Lepidodendron</i> brings out the distribution of
    thin and thick-walled tissue. Regularly placed prominences on such a
    stem as the <i>Knorria</i> shown in fig. 23 are due to the existence
    in the original stem of spirally disposed areas of thin-walled and
    less resistant tissue; as decay proceeded, the thinner cells would be
    the first to disappear, and depressions would thus be formed in the
    surrounding thicker walled and stronger tissue. If the stem became
    embedded in mud or sand before the more resistant tissue had time to
    decay, but after the removal of the thin-walled cells, the surrounding
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>sediment would fill up the depressions and finally, after the complete
    decay of the stem, the impression on the mould or on the cast, formed
    by the filling up of the space left by the stem, would have the
    form of regularly disposed projections marking the position of the
    more delicate tissues. The specimen represented in the figure is an
    exceedingly interesting and well preserved example of a Coal-Measure
    stem combining in itself representatives of what were formerly spoken
    of as distinct genera.</p>

  <p>The surface of the fossil as seen at <i>e</i> affords a typical example
    of the Knorria type of stem; the spirally disposed peg-like projections
    are the casts of cavities formed by the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>decay of the delicate cells
    surrounding each leaf-trace bundle on its way through the cortex of the
    stem. The surface <i>g</i> exhibits a somewhat different appearance,
    owing to the fact that we have the cast of the stem taken at a slightly
    different level. The surface of the thick layer of coal at a shows
    very clearly the outlines of the leaf-cushions; on the somewhat deeper
    surfaces <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> the leaf-cushions are but
    faintly indicated, and the long narrow lines on the coal at <i>c</i>
    represent the leaf-traces in the immediate neighbourhood of the
    leaf-cushions.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">IMPERFECT CASTS.</div>

  <p>It is not uncommon among the older plant-bearing rocks to find a
    piece of sandstone or shale of which the surface exhibits a somewhat
    irregular reticulate pattern, the long and oval meshes having the
    form of slightly raised bosses. The size of such a reticulum may
    vary from one in which the pattern is barely visible to the unaided
    eye to one with meshes more than an inch in length. The generic name
    <i>Lyginodendron</i><a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> was proposed several years ago (1843) for
    a specimen having such a pattern on its surface, but without any
    clue having been found as to the meaning of the elongated raised
    areas separated from one another by a narrow groove. At a later date
    Williamson investigated the anatomy of some petrified fragments
    of a Carboniferous plant which suggested a possible explanation
    of the surface features in the structureless specimens. The name
    <i>Lyginodendron</i> was applied to this newly discovered plant, of
    which one characteristic was found to be the occurrence of a hypodermal
    band of strong thick-walled tissue arranged in the form of a network
    with the meshes occupied by thin-walled parenchyma. If such a stem
    were undergoing gradual decay, the more delicate tissue of the meshes
    would be destroyed first and the harder framework left. A cast of such
    a partially decayed stem would take the form, therefore, of projecting
    areas, corresponding to the hollowed out areas of decayed tissue, and
    intervening depressions corresponding to the projecting framework of
    the more resistant fibrous tissue. A precisely similar arrangement of
    hypodermal strengthening tissue occurs in various Palaeozoic and other
    plants, and casts presenting a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>corresponding appearance cannot be
    referred with certainty to one special genus; such casts are of no real
    scientific value<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.</p>

  <p>The old generic terms <i>Artisia</i> and <i>Sternbergia</i> illustrate
    another source of error which can be avoided only by means of a
    knowledge of internal structure. The former name was proposed by
    Sternberg and the latter by Artis for precisely similar Carboniferous
    fossils, having the form of cylindrical bodies marked by numerous
    transverse annular ridges and grooves. These fossils are now known
    to be casts of the large discoid pith of the genus <i>Cordaites</i>,
    an extinct type of Palaeozoic Gymnosperms. <i>Calamites</i> and
    <i>Tylodendron</i> afford other instances of plants in which the
    supposed surface characters have been shown to be those of the
    pith-cast. The former genus is described at length in a later chapter,
    but the latter may be briefly referred to. A cast, apparently of a
    stem, from the Permian rocks of Russia was figured in 1870 under the
    name <i>Tylodendron</i>; the surface being characterised by spirally
    arranged lozenge-shaped projections, described as leaf-scars. Specimens
    were eventually discovered in which the supposed stem was shown to
    be a cast of the large pith of a plant possessing secondary wood
    very like that of the recent genus <i>Araucaria</i>. The projecting
    portions, instead of being leaf-cushions, were found to be the casts
    of depressions in the inner face of the wood where strands of vascular
    tissue bent outwards on their way to the leaves. If a cast is made of
    the comparatively large pith of <i>Araucaria imbricata</i> the features
    of <i>Tylodendron</i> are fairly closely reproduced<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.</p>

  <p>A dried Bracken frond lying on the ground in the Autumn presents a very
    different appearance as regards the form of the ultimate segments of
    the frond to that of a freshly cut leaf. In the former the edges of
    the pinnules are strongly recurved, and their shape is considerably
    altered. Immersed in water for some time fern fronds or other leaves
    undergo maceration, and the more delicate lamina of the leaf rots away
    much more rapidly than the scaffolding of veins. Among fossil fern
    fronds <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>differences in the form of the pinnules and in the shape and
    extent of the lamina, to which a specific value is assigned, are no
    doubt in many cases merely the expression either of differences in the
    state of the leaves at the time of fossilisation or of the different
    conditions under which they became embedded. Differential decay and
    disorganisation of plant tissues are factors of considerable importance
    with regard to the fossilisation of plants. As Lindley<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and later
    writers have suggested, the absence or comparative scarcity of certain
    forms of plants from a particular fossil flora may in some cases be
    due to their rapid decay and non-preservation as fossils; it does not
    necessarily mean that such plants were unrepresented in the vegetation
    of that period. The decayed rhizomes of the Bracken fern often seen
    hanging from the roadside banks on a heath or moorland, and consisting
    of flat dark coloured bands of resistant sclerenchyma in a loose sheath
    of the hard shrivelled tissue, are in striking contrast to the perfect
    stem. A rotting Palm stem is gradually reduced to a loose stringy mass
    consisting of vascular strands of which the connecting parenchymatous
    tissue has been entirely removed. It must frequently have happened that
    detached vascular bundles or strands and plates of hard strengthening
    tissue have been preserved as fossils and mistaken for complete
    portions of plants.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">MINERAL DEPOSITS SIMULATING PLANTS.</div>

  <p>Apart from the necessity of keeping in view the possible differences
    in form due to the state of the plant fragments at the time of
    preservation, and the marked contrast between the same species
    preserved in different kinds of rock, there are numerous sources of
    error which belong to an entirely different category. The so-called
    moss-agates and the well-known dendritic markings of black oxide of
    manganese, are among the better known instances of purely inorganic
    structures simulating plant forms.</p>

  <p>An interesting example of this striking similarity between a purely
    mineral deposit and the external form of a plant is afforded by some
    specimens originally described as impressions of the oldest known
    fern. The frontispiece to a well-known work on fossil plants, <cite>Le
    monde des plantes avant l’apparition de l’homme</cite><a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>represents a fern-like fossil on the surface of a piece of Silurian
    slate. The supposed plant was named <i>Eopteris Morierei</i> Sap.,
    and it is occasionally referred to as the oldest land plant in books
    of comparatively recent date. In the Museum of the School of Mines,
    Berlin, there are some specimens of Angers slate on some of which the
    cleavage face shows a shallow longitudinal groove bearing on either
    side somewhat irregularly oblong and oval appendages of which the
    surface is traversed by fine vein-like markings. A careful examination
    of the slate reveals the fact that these apparent fern pinnules are
    merely films of iron pyrites deposited from a solution which was
    introduced along the rachis-like channel. Many of the extraordinary
    structures described as plants by Reinsch<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> in his Memoir on the
    minute structure of coal have been shown to be of purely mineral origin.</p>

  <p>The innumerable casts of animal-burrows and trails as well as the casts
    of egg-cases and various other bodies, which have been described as
    fossil algae, must be included among the most fruitful sources of error.</p>

  <p>It requires but a short experience of microscopical investigation
    of fossil plant structures to discover numerous pitfalls in the
    appearance presented by sections of calcareous and siliceous nodules.
    The juxtaposition of tissues apparently parts of the same plant, and
    the penetration by growing roots of partially decayed plant débris,
    serve to mislead an unpractised observer. In sections of the English
    ‘calcareous nodules’ one very frequently finds the tissue of Stigmarian
    appendages occupying every conceivable position, and preserved in
    places admirably calculated to lead to false interpretations. The
    more minute investigation of tissues is often rendered difficult by
    deceptive appearances simulating original structures, but which are
    in reality the result of mineralisation. It is no easy matter in
    some cases to discover whether a particular cell in a fossil tissue
    was originally thick-walled, or whether its sclerous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>appearance is
    due to the deposition of mineral matter on the inside of the thin
    cell-membrane. Examples of such sources of error as have been briefly
    referred to, and others, will be found in various parts of the
    descriptive portions of this book.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">TRACES OF WOOD-BORERS IN PETRIFIED TISSUE.</div>

  <p>There is one other form of pitfall which should be briefly noticed.
    In sections of petrified plants one occasionally finds clean cut
    canals penetrating a mass of tissue, and differing in their manner of
    occurrence and in their somewhat larger size from ordinary secretory
    ducts. Such tunnels or canals are probably the work of a wood-boring
    animal. An example is illustrated in fig. 24 <i>A</i>. Similarly it is
    not unusual to meet with groups or nests of spherical or elliptical
    bodies lying among plant tissues, and having the appearance of spores.
    Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> spore-like bodies appear on close examination to be made up
    of finely comminuted particles of tissue, and in all probability
    they are the coprolites of some xylophagous animal. Examples of such
    coprolites are shown in fig. 24 <i>A</i><a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, and in fig. 24 <i>B</i>
    an interesting manner of occurrence of these misleading bodies is
    represented. The framework of cells enclosing the nest of coprolites in
    fig. 24 <i>B</i>, represents the outer tissues of a Lepidodendroid or a
    Sigillarian leaf; the inner tissues have been destroyed and the cavity
    is now occupied by what may possibly be the excreta of the wood-eating
    animal.</p>

  <p>Some of the oval spore-like structures met with in plant tissues
    may, as Renault has suggested, be the eggs of an Arthropod<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.
    In a section of a calcareous Coal-Measure nodule in the Williamson
    collection (British Museum)<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> there occur several fungal spores
    or possibly oogonia lying among imperfectly preserved Stigmarian
    appendages. Associated with these are numerous dark coloured and larger
    bodies consisting of a cavity bounded by a simple membrane; the larger
    bodies may well be the eggs of some Arthropod or other animal.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PHOTOGRAPHY AND ILLUSTRATION.</div>

  <p>In looking through the collections of Coal-Measure plants in the
    Museums of Berlin, Vienna and other continental towns, one cannot fail
    to be struck with the larger size of many of the specimens as compared
    with those usually seen in English Museums. The facilities afforded
    in the State Collieries of Germany to the scientific investigator may
    account in part at least for the better specimens which he is able
    to obtain. It would no doubt be a great gain to our collections of
    Coal-Measure plants if arrangements could be made in some collieries
    for the preservation of the finer specimens met with in the working of
    the seams, instead of breaking up the slabs of shale and consigning
    everything to the waste heaps. There is one more point which should be
    alluded to in connection with possible sources of error, and that is
    the essential importance of accuracy in the illustration of specimens,
    especially as regard <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>type-specimens. It is often impossible to inspect
    the original fossils which have served as types, and it is of the
    utmost importance that the published figures should be as faithful
    as possible. M. Crépin<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> of Brussels, in an article on the use of
    photography in illustrating, has given some examples of the confusion
    and mistakes caused by imperfect drawings. It does not require a long
    experience of palaeobotanical work to demonstrate the need of care in
    the execution of drawings for reproduction.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Any</span> attempt to discuss at length the difficult and thorny question
    of nomenclature would be entirely out of place in an elementary book
    on fossil plants, but there are certain important points to which it
    may be well to draw attention. When a student enters the field of
    independent research, he is usually but imperfectly acquainted with the
    principles of nomenclature which should be followed in palaeontological
    work. After losing himself in a maze of endless synonyms and confused
    terminology, he recognises the desirability of adopting some definite
    and consistent plan in his method of naming genera and species. It is
    extremely probable that whatever system is made use of, it will be
    called in question by some critics as not being in strict conformity
    with accepted rules. The opportunities for criticism in matters
    relating to nomenclature are particularly numerous, and the critic who
    may be but imperfectly familiar with the subject-matter of a scientific
    work is not slow to avail himself of some supposed eccentricity on the
    part of the author in the manner of terminology. The true value of work
    may be obscured by laying too much emphasis on the imperfections of a
    somewhat heterodox nomenclature. On the other hand good systematic work
    is often seriously spoilt by a want of attention to generally accepted
    rules in naming and defining species. It is essential that those who
    take up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> systematic research should pay attention to the necessary
    though secondary question of technical description.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">RULES FOR NOMENCLATURE.</div>

  <p>In inventing a new generic or specific name, it is well to adhere to
    some definite plan as regards the form or termination of the words
    used. To deal with this subject in detail, or to recapitulate a
    series of rules as to the best method of constructing names whether
    descriptive or personal, would take us beyond the limits of a single
    chapter. The student should refer for guidance to such recognised rules
    as those drawn up by the late Mr Strickland and others at the instance
    of the British Association<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.</p>

  <p>It is not infrequently the case that the same generic name has been
    applied to a fossil and to a recent species. Such a double use of the
    same term should always be avoided as likely to lead to confusion, and
    as tending to admit a divorce between botany and palaeobotany.</p>

  <p>In the course of describing a collection of fossil species, various
    problems are bound to present themselves as regards the best method
    of dealing with certain generic or specific names. A few general
    suggestions may prove of use to those who are likely to be confronted
    with the intricacies of scientific and pseudoscientific terminology.</p>

  <p>In writing the name of a species, it is important to append the name,
    often in an abbreviated form, of the author who first proposed the
    accepted specific designation. <i>Stigmaria ficoides</i> Brongn.
    written in this form records the fact that Brongniart was the author of
    the specific name <i>ficoides</i>. It means, moreover, that Brongniart
    not only suggested the name, but that he was the first to give either
    a figure or a diagnosis of this particular fossil. It is frequently
    the case that a specific name is proposed for a new species, without
    either figures or description; such a name is usually regarded as a
    <i>nomen nudum</i>, and must yield priority to the name which was first
    accompanied by some description or illustration sufficiently accurate
    to afford a means of recognition. A practice which may be recommended
    on the score of convenience is to write the name of the author of a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>species in brackets if he was not the first to use the generic as well
    as the specific name. <i>Onychiopsis Mantelli</i> (Brongn.) tells us
    that Brongniart founded the species, but made use of some other generic
    name than that which is now accepted. This leads us to another point
    of some importance. Brongniart described this characteristic Wealden
    fern under the name <i>Sphenopteris Mantelli</i>; <i>Sphenopteris</i>
    being one of those extremely useful provisional generic terms which
    are used in cases where we have no satisfactory proof of precise
    botanical affinity. <i>Sphenopteris</i> stands for fern fronds having
    a certain habit, form of segment and venation, and in this wide sense
    it necessarily includes representatives of various divisions and genera
    of Filices. If an example of a sphenopteroid frond is discovered with
    sori or spores sufficiently well preserved to enable us to determine
    its botanical position within narrower limits, we may with advantage
    employ another genus in place of the purely artificial form-genus
    which was originally chosen as a consequence of imperfect knowledge.
    Fronds of this Wealden fern have recently been found with well defined
    fertile segments having a form apparently identical with that which
    characterises the polypodiaceous genus <i>Onychium</i>. For this reason
    the name <i>Onychiopsis</i> has been adopted. It is safer and more
    convenient to use a name which differs in its termination from that
    of the recent plant with which we believe the fossil to be closely
    related. A common custom is to slightly alter the recent name by adding
    the termination <em>-opsis</em> or <em>-ites</em>. There are several other
    provisional generic terms that are often used in Fossil Botany, and
    which might be advantageously chosen in many cases where the misleading
    resemblance of external form has often given rise to the use of a name
    implying affinities which cannot be satisfactorily demonstrated.</p>

  <p>It was the custom of some of the earliest writers, in spite of their
    habit of using the names of recent Flowering plants for extinct
    Palaeozoic species of Vascular Cryptogams, to adopt also general and
    comprehensive terms. We find such a name as <i>Lithoxylon</i> employed
    by Lhwyd<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> in 1699 as a convenient designation for fossil wood.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

  <div class="sidenote">THE RULE OF PRIORITY.</div>

  <p>One of the most important and frequently disputed questions associated
    with the naming of species is that of priority. No name given to a
    plant in pre-Linnaean days need be considered, as our present system
    of nomenclature dates from the institution of the binominal system
    by Linnaeus. As a general rule, which it is advisable to follow, the
    specific name which was first given to a plant, if accompanied by a
    figure or diagnosis, should take priority over a name of later date.
    If <i>A</i> in 1850 describes a species under a certain name, and in
    1860 <i>B</i> proposes a new name for the same species, either in
    ignorance of the older name or from disapproval of <i>A</i>’s choice
    of a specific term, the later name should not be allowed to supersede
    <i>A</i>’s original designation. Such a rule is not only just to the
    original author, but is one which, if generally observed, would lead
    to less confusion and would diminish unnecessary multiplication of
    specific names. Some writers would have us conform in all cases to this
    rule of priority, which they consistently adhere to apart from all
    considerations of convenience or long-established custom. There are,
    however, cogent reasons for maintaining a certain amount of freedom.
    While accepting priority as a good rule in most cases, it is unwise
    to allow ourselves to be too servile in our conformity to a principle
    which was framed in the interests of convenience, if the strict
    application of the rule clearly makes for confusion and inconvenience.
    A name may have been in use for say eighty years, and has become
    perfectly familiar as the recognised designation of a particular
    fossil; it is discovered, however, that an older name was proposed
    for the same species ninety years ago, and therefore according to the
    priority rule, we must accustom ourselves to a new name in place of one
    which is thoroughly established by long usage. From a scientific point
    of view, the ideal of nomenclature is to be plain and intelligible. To
    prefer priority to established usage entails obscurity and confusion.
    If priority is to be the rule which we must invariably obey in
    the shadowy hope that by such means finality in nomenclature<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
    may be reached, it becomes necessary for the student to devote no
    inconsiderable portion <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>of his time to antiquarian research, with a
    view to discover whether a particular name may be stamped with the
    hallmark of ‘the very first.’ While admitting the advisability of
    retaining as a general principle the original generic or specific
    name, the extreme subservience to ‘the priority craze’ without regard
    to convenience, would seem to lead irresistibly to the view that
    “botanists who waste their time over priority are like boys who, when
    sent on an errand, spend their time in playing by the roadside<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>.”</p>

  <div class="sidenote">TERMINOLOGY AND CONVENIENCE.</div>

  <p>There is another point which cannot be satisfactorily settled in all
    cases by a rigid adherence to an arbitrary rule. How far should we
    regard a generic name in the sense of a mere mark or sign to denote a
    particular plant, or to what extent may we accept the literal meaning
    of the generic term as an index of the affinity or character of the
    plant? If we consider the etymology of many generic names, we soon find
    that they are entirely inappropriate as aids in recognizing the true
    taxonomic position of the plants to which they are applied. The generic
    name <i>Calamites</i> was first suggested by the supposed resemblance
    of this Palaeozoic plant to recent reeds. If considered etymologically,
    it is merely a record of a past mistake, but it would be absurd to
    discard such a well-known name on the grounds that the genus is a
    Vascular Cryptogam and far removed from reeds. On the other hand,
    there often arise cases which present a real difficulty. The following
    example conveniently illustrates two distinct points of view as regards
    generic nomenclature. In 1875 Saporta described and figured a fragment
    of a fossil plant from the Jurassic beds of France as <i>Cycadorachis
    armata</i><a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>; the name being chosen in the belief that the specimen
    was part of a cycadean petiole, and there were good grounds for such
    a view. A few years ago Mr Rufford discovered more perfect specimens,
    in the Wealden rocks of Sussex, clearly belonging to Saporta’s genus,
    and these afforded definite evidence that Saporta had been deceived by
    the imperfection of the specimens as to their true botanical position.
    Owing to the obviously misleading name first given <span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>to this plant, I
    ventured to substitute <i>Withamia</i><a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> for <i>Cycadorachis</i>,
    and chose such a term in preference to one denoting affinity, on
    account of the difficulty of placing the plant in a definite class or
    family. On the other hand, it has been objected that the original name,
    despite its meaningless meaning—if the expression may be used—should be
    retained. A friendly critic<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>, in writing of the proposed change of
    <i>Cycadorachis</i>, urges the importance of adhering to the name which
    was first applied to a genus. The same author pertinently remarks that
    we can no more dispense with a nomenclature than we can dispense with
    language. We may extend the comparison and point out that in language,
    as in scientific nomenclature, conciseness, clearness and convenience
    should be kept in view as guiding principles.</p>

  <p>The student must judge for himself what course to follow in each
    case. While adhering as far as possible to a consistent plan, he must
    take care that he does not allow his own judgment to be completely
    over-ridden by a blind obedience to fixed rules, which if pressed too
    far may defeat their own ends.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THALLOPHYTA.</div>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="smcap">The</span> divisions of the plant kingdom dealt with in the following chapters
      of Volume I. are taken in their natural sequence, beginning with the
      lowest and passing gradually to the highest groups. The list of the
      classes and families included in Chapters VII.–XI. is given in the
      table of contents preceding Chapter I.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Thallophytes are of the simplest type, but they exhibit a very wide
    range as regards both the structure and differentiation of the
    vegetative body and the methods of reproduction. In some cases the
    individual consists of a minute simple cell which multiplies by
    cell-division; in others the body or thallus is made up of a number of
    similar units, while in a great number of forms there is a well-marked
    physiological division of labour, as expressed both in the external
    division of the thallus into distinct organs corresponding in function
    to the root, stem, and leaves of the higher plants, and further in
    the high degree of histological differentiation of the tissues. In
    other thallophytes, again, the thallus is a <i>coenocyte</i> either
    unseptate or incompletely septate; that is, the individual consists
    of a single cell differing from a true plant-cell, in the stricter
    sense of the term, in possessing several nuclei, in other words, the
    thallus is divided up into compartments by transverse septa, but each
    division contains more than one nucleus. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> coenocytic plants may
    show well-marked external differentiation of the thallus into members
    or parts subserving different functions.</p>

  <p>A similar wide range is covered by the methods of reproduction among
    thallophytes.</p>

  <h3 id="PERIDINIALES">I. PERIDINIALES.</h3>

  <p>The organisms included under this head are of little importance from a
    palaeontological point of view, but a brief reference may be made to
    them as a section of the Thallophyta.</p>

  <p>The Peridiniales include very small single-celled organisms which have
    often been described as occupying a position on the borderland between
    animals and plants, lying on the “shadowy boundary between animal and
    vegetable life.” The individuals are rarely naked, more frequently
    they are covered with a cellulose or mucilaginous investment which
    has frequently the form of two or more minute armour-like plates of
    a limiting membrane. The chromatophores are green, yellow, brown or
    colourless. Simple division is the usual method of reproduction, but
    spores have been described as occurring in some species. The motile
    forms are provided with cilia. The Peridiniaceae, a section of the
    Peridiniales, are regarded as nearly related to the Diatoms.</p>

  <p>The Peridiniales play an important rôle in the Plankton flora of the
    sea and freshwater lakes, and have a world-wide distribution. In the
    narrative of the Challenger cruise they are described as occasionally
    filling the tow-nets with a yellow coloured slime<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. Some genera,
    such as <i>Ceratium</i>, are found in enormous numbers off the British
    coast.</p>

  <p>As an example of the occurrence of fossil representatives of the
    Peridiniaceae reference may be made to one of two species of
    <i>Peridinium</i> described by Ehrenberg in 1836. These were found in a
    siliceous rock described as Cretaceous in age from Delitzsch in Saxony.
    A comparison of Ehrenberg’s figures of the fossil species <i>Peridinium
    pyrophorum</i> Ehrenb.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>, with those <span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>of the recent species
    <i>Peridinium divergens</i> Ehrenb., as given by Schütt<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and other
    writers, brings out clearly the very close resemblance if not identity
    of the two forms. Bütschli<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> in his account of the Dinoflagellata
    in Bronn’s <cite>Thier-Reich</cite> confirms Ehrenberg’s determination of
    <i>Peridinium pyrophorum</i>, and points out its striking agreement
    with the recent species.</p>

  <h3 id="COCCOSPHERES_AND_RHABDOSPHERES">II. COCCOSPHERES AND RHABDOSPHERES.</h3>

  <div class="center">(Organisms of doubtful affinity.)</div>

  <p>Our knowledge of these minute calcareous organisms is derived from
    Huxley’s description of coccoliths from the Atlantic in 1857, and from
    the accounts of Wallich, John Murray, and other writers. In the first
    volume of the narrative of the Challenger cruise<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and in the volume
    on deep-sea deposits<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> these minute forms of life are figured and
    described. In the latter volume both genera are spoken of as extremely
    abundant in the surface waters of the tropical and temperate regions
    of the open ocean, and as forming an important constituent of the
    Globigerine ooze; they are said to occur entangled in the gelatinous
    substance of the Radiolarians, Diatoms, and Foraminifera, and are very
    common in the stomachs of Salps, Pteropods and other pelagic animals.
    Rhabdospheres are rare in regions where the temperature of the water
    sinks below 65° F.; the Coccospheres occur in tropical and temperate
    latitudes, and extend further north and south than the Rhabdospheres.
    As regards their botanical position, John Murray expresses the view
    that they are in all probability pelagic algae.</p>

  <p>In the interesting memoir by Schütt on the <i>Pflanzenleben der
    Hochsee</i><a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> there occurs a short reference to the forms described
    in the Challenger Reports, but they were not obtained by the staff
    of the Hensen Plankton Expedition and Schütt’s remarks are not based
    therefore on personal observations. While admitting the existence of
    such bodies, he points out that Zoologists have referred Coccospheres
    and Rhabdospheres <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>to the algae as organisms which cannot be included
    in any group of animals, and Schütt is unable to recognise a sufficient
    reason for referring them to this class of plants. It is suggested
    indeed that they may be purely inorganic structures.</p>

  <p>The most recent account of these two genera is by Messrs G. Murray
    and Blackman a short notice in <cite>Nature</cite> for April 1, 1897<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.
    Numerous examples of Coccospheres and Rhabdospheres were obtained by
    Capt. Milner of the R.M.S. Para during a voyage to Barbados by allowing
    the sea water to enter the feed-pipe of the boiler through a fine
    muslin net. All the forms described in the Challenger Reports were met
    with, and an examination of the material by means of extremely high
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>objectives has confirmed the original account of the genera, and added
    some points to our previous knowledge.</p>

  <p><i>Coccospheres</i> (fig. 25 <i>A</i>). Spherical bodies of exceedingly
    small size, consisting of a central protoplasmic vesicle covered with
    overlapping circular calcareous scales, each of which is attached to
    the minute cell by a button-like projection. The scales are frequently
    found detached and are then spoken of as Coccoliths.</p>

  <p><i>Rhabdospheres</i> (fig. 25 <i>B</i>–<i>F</i>). Spherical bodies,
    extremely minute, consisting of a single cell, on the surface of which
    are embedded numerous calcareous plates bearing long blunt spines
    (fig. 25, <i>C</i>) or beautiful trumpet-like appendages (fig. 25,
    <i>D</i>–<i>F</i>). The detached plates of Rhabdospheres are known as
    Rhabdoliths.</p>

  <p>In addition to the text-figures of Coccospheres and Rhabdospheres in
    the Challenger Reports, the same structures are shown in samples of
    globigerine ooze figured in Plate XI. of the Monograph on deep-sea
    deposits. In a recent number of <cite>Nature</cite> Messrs Dixon and
    Joly<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> have announced the discovery of Coccoliths and Coccospheres
    in the coastal waters off South County Dublin. They estimate that in
    one sample of water taken about three miles from the Irish coast there
    were 200 Coccoliths in each cubic centimetre of sea water.</p>

  <p>The interest of these calcareous bodies from a palaeobotanical point of
    view lies in the fact that similar forms have been recognized in the
    Chalk and the Upper Lias. Sorby, in his memorable Address delivered
    before the Geological Society in 1879, refers to the abundance of
    Coccoliths in sections of chalk which he examined<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. Rothpletz<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
    has recently recorded the occurrence of numerous Coccoliths, 5–12
    µ in diameter, associated with the skeleton of a horny sponge
    (<i>Phymatoderma</i>) of Liassic age.</p>

  <p>The question of the nature of Coccospheres and Rhabdospheres cannot be
    regarded as definitely settled. It has been shown by J. Murray, and
    more recently by G. Murray and V. H. Blackman, that on the solution of
    the calcareous material by a weak acid there remains a small gelatinous
    body <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>apparently protoplasmic in nature. We may at least express the
    opinion that Schütt’s suggestion as to their being inorganic must be
    ruled out of court. It would appear that they are extremely minute
    unicellular organisms characterised by a delicate calcareous armour
    consisting of numerous plates or scales. We know nothing as to their
    life-history, and cannot attempt to determine their affinities with
    any degree of certainty until further facts are before us. It is not
    improbable that they are algae of an extremely minute size, and the
    evidence so far obtained would lead us to regard them as complete
    individuals rather than the reproductive cells of some larger organism.
    Mr George Murray is of opinion that they are certainly algae, but he
    considers that they cannot be included in any existing family. It is
    conceivable that they may be minute eggs or reproductive cells of
    animals or plants, but on the whole the balance of probability would
    seem to be in favour of regarding them as autonomous organisms.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In this group are included small single-celled plants of an extremely
    low type of organisation, in which reproduction takes the form of
    multiplication by simple cell-division, or the formation of spores.
    The characteristic method of reproduction by division has given rise
    to the general term Fission-plants for this lowest sub-class in the
    vegetable kingdom. In many cases the members of this sub-class contain
    chlorophyll, and associated with it a blue-green colouring matter; such
    plants are classed together as the Blue-green algae, Cyanophyceae,
    or Schizophyceae. Others, again, are destitute of chlorophyll, and
    may be conveniently designated Schizomycetes or Fission-fungi. Seeing
    how close is the resemblance and relationship between the members of
    the sub-class, it has been the custom to include them as two parallel
    series under the general head, Schizophyta, rather than to incorporate
    them among the Algae and Fungi respectively.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

  <h4 id="SCHIZOPHYCEAE">A. SCHIZOPHYCEAE (<span class="smcap">Cyanophyceae</span> or Blue-green Algae).</h4>

  <p><i>Chroococcaceae.</i> Thallus of a single cell, the cells may be
    either free, or more usually joined together in colonies enveloped by
    a common gelatinous matrix, formed by the mucilaginous degeneration of
    the outer portion of the cell-walls. Reproduction by means of simple
    division or resting cells.</p>

  <p><i>Nostocaceae.</i> Thallus consists of simple or branched rows of
    cells in which special cells known as <em>heterocysts</em> often occur.
    Reproduction by means of germ-plants or <em>hormogonia</em>, or by
    resting cells specially modified to resist unfavourable conditions.</p>

  <p>In both families the individuals are surrounded by a gelatinous
    envelope, which in some genera assumes the form of a conspicuous
    and comparatively resistant sheath. Marine, freshwater, and aerial
    forms are represented among recent genera. Several species occur as
    endophytes, living in the tissues or mucilage-containing spaces in the
    bodies of higher plants. In addition to the frequent occurrence of
    blue-green algae in freshwater streams and on damp surfaces, certain
    forms are particularly abundant in the open sea<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>, and in lakes or
    meres<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> where they are the cause of what is known in some parts
    of the country as “the breaking of the meres” (“Fleurs d’eau”). From
    the narrative of the cruise of the Challenger, we learn that the
    Oscillariaceae are especially abundant in the surface waters of the
    ocean. The “sea sawdust” so named by Cook’s sailors<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>, and the same
    floating scum collected by Darwin<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>, affords an illustration of the
    abundance of some of these blue-green algae in the sea.</p>

  <p>Another manner of occurrence of these plants has been recorded by
    different writers, which is of special importance from the point of
    view of fossil algae. On the shores of the Great Salt Lake, Utah, there
    are found numerous small oolitic calcareous bodies thrown up by the
    waves<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>. These are coated with the cells of <i>Glœocapsa</i> and
    <i>Glœotheca</i>, two genera of the Chroococcaceae. Sections of the
    grains reveal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>the presence of the same forms in the interior of the
    calcareous matrix, and it has been concluded, on good evidence that the
    algae are responsible for the deposition of the carbonate of lime of
    the oolitic grains. By extracting the carbonic acid which they require
    as a source of food, from the waters of the lake, the solvent power of
    the water is decreased and carbonate of lime is thrown down. In similar
    white grains from the Red Sea<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> there is a central nucleus in the
    form of a grain of sand, and cells of Chroococcaceae occur in the
    surrounding carbonate of lime as in the Salt Lake oolite. Prof. Cohn of
    Breslau in 1862 demonstrated the importance of low forms of plant life
    in the deposition of the Carlsbad “Sprudelstein<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>.” On the bottom of
    Lough Belvedere, near Mullingar in Ireland<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>, there occur numerous
    spherical calcareous pebbles, of all sizes up to that of a filbert.
    From a pond in Michigan (U.S.A.)<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> similar bodies have been obtained
    varying in diameter from one to three and a half inches. In the former
    pebbles a species of <i>Schizothrix</i>, one of the Nostocaceae occurs
    in abundance, in the form of chains of small cells enclosed in the
    characteristic and comparatively hard tubular sheath, and associated
    with <i>Schizothrix fasciculata</i> there have been found <i>Nostoc</i>
    cells and the siliceous frustules of Diatoms. In the Michigan nodules
    the same <i>Schizothrix</i> occurs, associated with <i>Stigonema</i>
    and <i>Dichothrix</i>, other genera of the Nostocaceae. One of the
    Michigan pebbles is shown in section in fig. 32 <i>D</i>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">OOLITIC STRUCTURE.</div>

  <p>The connection between the well-known oolitic structure, characteristic
    of rocks of various ages in all parts of the world, and the presence
    of algal cells is of the greatest interest from a geological point
    of view. In recent years considerable attention has been paid to
    the structure of oolitic rocks, and in many instances there have
    been found in the calcareous grains tubular structures suggestive of
    simple cylindrical plants, which have probably been concerned in the
    deposition of the carbonate of lime of which the granules consist. In
    1880 Messrs Nicholson and Etheridge<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> recorded the occurrence of
    such a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>tubular structure in calcareous nodules obtained from a rock
    of Ordovician age in the Girvan district of Scotland. These Authors
    considered the tubes to be those of some Rhizopod, and proposed to
    designate the fossil <i>Girvanella</i>.</p>

  <h5 id="Girvanella"><i>Girvanella</i> (fig. 26).</h5>

  <p>Messrs Nicholson and Etheridge defined the genus as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Microscopic tubuli, with arenaceous or calcareous (?) walls,
      flexuous or contorted, circular in section, forming loosely
      compacted masses. The tubes, apparently simple cylinders, without
      perforations in their sides, and destitute of internal partitions
      or other structures of a similar kind.”</p>
  </blockquote>

      Wenlock limestone, May Hill. × 65</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Since this diagnosis was published very many examples of similar
    tubular fossils have been described by several writers in rocks from
    widely separated geological horizons. The accompanying sketch (Fig.
    26), drawn from a micro-photograph kindly lent to me by Mr Wethered
    of Cheltenham, who has made oolitic grains a special subject of
    careful investigation, affords a good example of the occurrence of
    such tubular structures in an oolitic grain of Silurian age from the
    Wenlock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> limestone of May Hill, Gloucestershire<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>. In the centre
    is a crystalline core or nucleus round which the tubules have grown,
    and presumably they had an important share in the deposition of the
    calcareous substance. The nature of <i>Girvanella</i>, and still
    more its exact position in the organic world, is quite uncertain; it
    is mentioned rather as <i lang="fr">à propos</i> of the association of recent
    Cyanophyceae with oolitic structure, than as a well-defined genus of
    fossil algae.</p>

  <p>In the typo description of the calcareous nodules from Michigan, Murray
    speaks of the <i>Schizothrix</i> filaments at the surface of the
    pebbles as fairly intact, while nearer the centre only sheaths were met
    with. It is conceivable that in some of the tubular structures referred
    to <i>Girvanella</i> we have the mineralised sheaths of a fossil
    Cyanophyceous genus<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>. The organic nature of these tubules has been
    a matter of dispute, but we may probably assume with safety that in
    some at least of the fossil oolitic grains there are distinct traces of
    some simple organism which was in all likelihood a plant. Some authors
    have suggested that <i>Girvanella</i> is a calcareous alga which should
    be included in the family Siphoneae<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. As a matter of fact we must
    be content for the present to leave its precise nature as still <i>sub
    judice</i>, and while regarding it as probably an alga, we may venture
    to consider it more fittingly discussed under the Schizophyta than
    elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Wethered<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> would go so far as to refer oolitic structure in general
    to an organic origin. While admitting that a Girvanella-like structure
    has been very frequently met with in oolitic rocks, it would be unwise
    to adopt so far-reaching a conclusion. It is at least premature to
    refer the formation of all oolitic structure to algal agency, and the
    evidence adduced is by no means convincing in every case. The discovery
    of <i>Girvanella</i> and allied forms in rocks from the Cambrian<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>Ordovician, Silurian, Carboniferous, Jurassic and other systems is a
    striking fact, and lends support to the view that oolitic structure
    is in many cases intimately associated with the presence of a simple
    tubular organism. Among recent algae we find different genera, and
    representatives of different families, growing in such a manner and
    under such circumstances as are favourable to the formation of a
    ball-like mass of algal threads, which may or may not be encrusted
    with carbonate of lime. Similarly as regards oolitic grains of various
    sizes, and the occurrence in rocks of calcareous nodules, the tubular
    structure is not always of precisely the same type, and cannot always
    be included under the genus <i>Girvanella</i>.</p>

  <p>Several observers have recorded the occurrence of low forms of
    plant-life in the waters of thermal springs. It has been already
    mentioned that Cohn described the occurrence of simple plants in the
    warm Carlsbad Springs, and fission-plants of various types have been
    discovered in the thermal waters of Iceland, the Azores<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>, New
    Zealand, the Yellowstone Park, Japan, India, and numerous other places.</p>

  <p>A few years ago Mr Weed, of the geological survey of the United States,
    published an interesting account of the formation of calcareous
    travertine and siliceous sinter in the Yellowstone Park district<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>.
    This author emphasizes the important rôle of certain forms of plants
    in the building up of the calcareous and siliceous material. Among
    other forms of frequent occurrence, <i>Calothrix gypsophila</i> and a
    species <i>Leptothrix</i> are mentioned, the former being a member of
    the Nostocaceae, allied to <i>Rivularia</i>, and the latter a genus of
    Schizomycetes. In many of the springs there are found masses of algal
    jelly like those previously described by Cohn in the Carlsbad waters.
    Sections of such dried jelly showed a number of interlaced filaments
    with glassy silica between them. Weed refers to the occurrence of small
    gritty particles in this mucilaginous material. These are calcareous
    oolitic granules which are eventually cemented together into a compact
    and firm mass of travertine by the continued deposition of carbonate
    of lime. The presence of the plant filaments is often difficult to
    recognise in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>“leathery sheet of tough gelatinous material,” or in
    “the skeins of delicate white filaments” which make up the travertine
    deposits.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">BORINGS IN SHELLS.</div>

  <p id="Borings_in_shells">Under the head of <i>Cyanophyceae</i>, mention should be made of the
    recent genus <i>Hyella</i><a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>, which occurs as a perforating or
    boring alga in the calcareous shells of molluscs. On dissolving the
    carbonate of lime of shells perforated by this alga, the latter is
    isolated and appears to consist of rows of small cells, with possibly
    some sporangia containing spores. Other boring algae have been recorded
    among the Chlorophyceae, and recently a member of the Rhodophyceae<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
    has been found living in the substance of calcareous shells. Such
    examples are worthy of note in view of the not infrequent occurrence of
    fossil corals, shells and fish-scales, which have evidently been bored
    by an organism resembling in form and manner of occurrence these recent
    algal borers.</p>

  <p>The occurrence of small ramifying tubes in recent and fossil corals,
    fish-scales, and bones was long ago pointed out by Quekett<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>,
    Kölliker<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>, Rose<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and other writers<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>. These narrow tubular
    cavities have generally been attributed to the boring action of
    some parasitic organism, either a fungus or an alga. In 1876 Duncan
    published two important papers<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> dealing with the occurrence of
    such tubes in recent corals, as well as in the calcareous skeleton of
    <i>Calceolina</i>, <i>Goniophyllum</i> and other Palaeozoic, Mesozoic
    and Tertiary species of corals. This writer attributed the formation
    of the cavities in the case of the fossil species to the action of a
    fungus which he named <i>Palaeachlya perforans</i>, and considered as
    very nearly related to <i>Achlya penetrans</i> found in the “dense
    sclerenchyma” of recent corals. In fig. 27 A. is reproduced one of the
    drawings given by Rose<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>in his paper published in 1855; it shows a
    section of a fish-scale from the Kimeridge clay which has been attacked
    by a boring organism. Rose attributes the dichotomously branched canals
    to some “infusorial parasite.”</p>

  <p>In the important paper by MM. Bornet and Flahault on perforating
    algae a full description is given of various boring forms belonging
    to the Chlorophyceae and the Cyanophyceae<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. The canals which
    these algae produce in calcareous shells and other hard substances
    are of the same type as those previously described in fossil corals,
    fish-scales and bones. In dealing with living perforating Thallophytes
    the colour and other cell-contents often enable us to distinguish
    between algae and fungi, but in fossil specimens such tests cannot be
    applied. The fossil tubular borings may or may not show traces of the
    transverse septa and reproductive cells; it is often the case that no
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>trace of the organism has been left, but only the canals by which it
    penetrated the calcareous or bony skeleton. In some of the examples of
    <i>Palaeachlya</i> figured by Duncan there appear to be numerous spores
    in some of the sections, but it is generally a very difficult and often
    an impossible task to discriminate between the borings of fungi and
    algae in fossil material.</p>

  <p>Fig. 27 B, which is copied from one of Bornet and Flahault’s drawings,
    represents a piece of Solen shell riddled with small canals made by the
    organism which has been named by the French authors <i>Ostracoblabe
    implexa</i>, and regarded by them as a fungus. Fig. 27 C represents a
    small piece of the vegetative body of <i>Ostracoblabe</i> obtained from
    a decalcified shell. In endeavouring to determine the organism which
    has produced borings in fossil corals or shells, it must be borne in
    mind that some forms of canals or passages may have been the work of
    perforating sponges, but these are larger in diameter than those made
    by algae or fungi. By some writers<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> the tubular cavities in shells
    have been referred to true algae, but others consider them to be of
    fungal origin.</p>

  <p>As an example of a fossil alga referred to the Cyanophyceae, the genus
    <i>Zonatrichites</i><a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> may be quoted. Bornemann, who first described
    the specimens, points out the close resemblance in habit to some
    members of the recent Rivulariaceae.</p>

  <h5 id="Zonatrichites"><i>Zonatrichites.</i></h5>

  <p>The author of the genus defines it as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“A calcareous alga, with radially arranged filaments, forming
      hemispherical or kidney-shaped layers, growing on or enclosing
      other bodies. Parallel or concentric zones are seen in
      cross-section, formed by the periodic growth of the alga, the
      older and dead layers serving as a foundation on which the young
      filaments grow in radially arranged groups.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The nodules which are apparently formed by species of this genus occur
    in various sizes and shapes; Bornemann describes one hemispherical
    mass 8 cm. broad and 4 cm. thick. In some <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>cases the organism has
    given rise to oolitic spherules, which in radial section exhibit the
    branched tubular cells spreading in fan-shaped groups from the centre
    of the oolitic grain. The section parallel to the surface of a nodule
    presents the appearance of a number of circular or elliptical tubes
    cut across transversely or more or less obliquely. The resemblance
    between the fossil and a specimen of the recent species <i>Zonatrichia
    calcivora</i> Braun, is certainly very close, but it is very difficult,
    in the absence of material exhibiting more detailed structure than
    is shown in the specimens described by Bornemann, to decide with any
    certainty the true position of the fossil. The figures do not enable us
    to recognise any trace of cells in the radiating tubes. It is possible
    that we have in <i>Zonatrichites</i> an example of a Cyanophyceous
    genus in which only the sheaths of the filaments have been preserved.
    In any case it is probable that this Mesozoic species affords another
    instance of a fossil alga which has been responsible for certain
    oolitic or other structures in limestone rocks.</p>

  <p>The species described by Bornemann was obtained from a Breccia near
    Lissau in Silesia, of Keuper age.</p>

  <p>M. Renault has recently described certain minute structures in
    a Palaeozoic coprolite to which he gives the name <i>Gloioconis
    Borneti</i><a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>, and which he regards as a Permian gelatinous
    alga similar to the well-known recent genus <i>Glœocapsa</i>. The
    appearances revealed in a section of the coprolite are interpreted
    by this author as a collection of small colonies of a unicellular
    gelatinous alga in various stages of development. Renault’s figure
    shows a spherical group of faintly outlined and cloudy bodies, most
    of which include one or two small dark spots. The latter are regarded
    as the cells of the alga, and the surrounding cloudy substance is
    described as the gelatinous sheath. The absence of a nucleus in these
    extremely minute fossil cells (8–10 µ in diameter) is referred to as
    an argument in favour of referring the organism to the Cyanophyceae
    rather than to the Chlorophyceae. It is possible that the ill-defined
    structure described by Renault may be a petrified alga, but there is
    not sufficient evidence to warrant a decided opinion; the absence of
    nuclei <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>can hardly be taken seriously in such a case as this as an
    argument in favour of the Cyanophyceae.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">CYANOPHYCEAE.</div>

  <p>Although our exact knowledge of fossil Cyanophyceae is extremely small,
    it is probable that such simple forms of plants existed in abundance
    during the past ages in the earth’s history. Several writers have
    expressed the opinion that the blue-green algae may be taken as the
    modern representatives of those earliest plants which first existed
    on an archaean land-surface. The living species possess the power of
    resisting unfavourable conditions in a marked degree, and are able
    to adapt themselves to very different surroundings. Their occurrence
    in hot springs proves them capable of living under conditions which
    are fatal to most plants, and suggests the possibility of their
    occurrence in the heated waters which probably constituted the medium
    in which vegetable life began. An interesting example of the growth of
    blue-green algae under unfavourable conditions was recorded in 1886 by
    Dr Treub<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> of the Buitenzorg Gardens, Java. In 1883 a considerable
    part of the island Krakatoa, situated in the Straits of Sunda, between
    Sumatra and Java, was entirely destroyed by a terrific volcanic
    explosion. What remained had been reduced to a lifeless mass of hot
    volcanic ashes. Three years later, Treub visited the island, and found
    that several plants had already established themselves on the volcanic
    rocks. Various ferns and flowering plants were recorded in Treub’s
    description of this newly established flora. It seemed that the barren
    rocky surface had been prepared for the more highly organised plants by
    the action of certain forms of Cyanophyceae, which were able to live
    under conditions which would be fatal to more complex types.</p>

  <p>In the petrified tissues of fossil plants there are occasionally
    found small spherical vesicles, with delicate limiting membranes, in
    the cavities of parenchymatous cells or in the elements of vascular
    tissue. Some of these spherical inclusions have been described as
    possibly simple forms of endophytic algae<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>, such as we are now
    familiar with in species of the Cyanophyceae and other algae. So far,
    however, no recorded instance of such fossil endophytic algae is
    entirely satisfactory. Some of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>cells figured by Williamson as
    possibly algae, endophytic in the tissues of Coal-Measure plants, are
    no doubt thin-walled vesicles which formed part of a highly vacuolated
    cell-contents. Examples of such vesicles in living and fossil cells are
    shown in fig. 42. The fact that the contents of living plant tissues
    have been erroneously described as endophytic organisms, should serve
    as a warning against describing fossil endophytes without the test of
    good evidence to support them.</p>

  <p>The description of a fossil <i>Nostoc</i> by the late Prof. Heer<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
    from the Tertiary rocks of Switzerland cannot be accepted as a
    trustworthy example of a fossil plant, much less of a genus of recent
    algae. The application of recent generic names to fossils which are
    possibly not even organic must do more harm than good.</p>

  <h4 id="SCHIZOMYCETES">B. SCHIZOMYCETES (Bacteria).</h4>

  <p>It is impossible to draw a sharp line between the two subdivisions of
    the Schizophyta. The so-called Fission-Fungi or Bacteria differ from
    the Schizophyceae or Fission-Algae in the cell-contents being either
    colourless, blood-red or green, but never blue-green. We may regard
    the Bacteria, generally, as the lowest forms of plants; they are
    extremely simple organisms which have been derived from some primitive
    types which possessed the power of independent existence and contained
    chlorophyll—that important substance which enables a plant to obtain
    its carbon first-hand from the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Bacteria may be briefly described as single-celled plants, and as de
    Bary suggested comparable in shape to a billiard ball, a lead pencil or
    a corkscrew<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>. A single spherical or cylindrical cell measures about
    1 µ in diameter<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. They occur either singly or in filaments, or as
    masses of various shapes consisting of numberless bacterial cells. The
    nature and manner of life of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>Bacteria, and their extraordinary power
    of successfully resisting the most unfavourable conditions, render it
    probable that they constitute an extremely ancient group of organisms.</p>

  <p>The wonderful perfection of preservation of many fossil plants enables
    us to investigate the contents of petrified cells and to examine in
    minutest detail the histology of extinct plants. To those who are
    familiar with the possibilities of microscopical research as applied to
    silicified and calcified fossil tissues, it is by no means incredible
    that evidence has been detected of the existence of Bacteria as far
    back in the history of the earth as the Carboniferous and Devonian
    periods.</p>

  <p>Were there no trustworthy records of the occurrence of Bacteria in
    Palaeozoic times, it would still be a natural supposition that these
    ubiquitous organisms must have been abundantly represented. It has
    been suggested as a probable conclusion that some forms of Bacteria,
    which produced chemical changes in the soil necessary for the nutrition
    of plants, must have existed contemporaneously with the oldest
    vegetation<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>.</p>

  <p>The paper-coal of Toula, which in some places reaches a thickness of 20
    cm., is a plant-bed of exceptional interest. It differs from ordinary
    coal in being made up of numberless thin brown-papery sheets associated
    with a darker coloured substance largely composed of ulmic acid. Prof.
    Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>, in an interesting account of the papery layers, has
    shown that they consist of the cuticles of a Lepidodendroid plant,
    <i>Bothrodendron</i>. An examination of a piece of one of the sheets at
    once reveals the existence of a regular network of which the walls of
    the meshes are the outlines of the epidermal cells, the meshes being
    bridged across by a thin light brown membrane which represents the
    layer of cuticularised cell-wall of each epidermal cell. At regular
    intervals and disposed in a spiral arrangement, we find small gaps in
    the papery cuticle which mark the position of the <i>Bothrodendron</i>
    leaves. These Palaeozoic cuticles are not petrified; they are only
    slightly altered, and have retained the power of swelling in water,
    being able to take up stains like recent <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>tissues. It may reasonably
    be assumed that the persistent cuticles owe their preservation to a
    greater power of resistance to destructive agents than was possessed
    by the other tissues of the plant. It is by no means unlikely, as
    Renault<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> has recently suggested, that as the <i>Bothrodendron</i>
    stem-fragments lay in the swamps or marshes the tissues were gradually
    eaten away by Bacteria, but the cuticles successfully resisted the
    attacks of the bacterial saprophytes. The same observer has described
    what he regards as the actual organism which effected this wholesale
    destruction, under the name <i>Micrococcus Zeilleri</i>. He finds,
    after treating the cuticles with ammonia to remove the ulmic acid, that
    there occur numerous minute spherical bodies, each surrounded by a thin
    envelope, either singly or in groups on the surface of the cuticular
    membrane. These vary in size from ·5µ to 1µ in diameter. I have not
    been able to detect any satisfactory proof of such <i>Micrococci</i> in
    specimens of the paper-coal which were treated according to Renault’s
    method, but it is extremely probable that this unusual method of
    preservation of stem-cuticles is the result of selective bacterial
    action.</p>

  <p>Renault believes that some of the minute spherulitic structures which
    are seen in sections of decayed tissues of Palaeozoic plants owe their
    origin, in part, to the ravages of bacteria. The disorganisation of
    parenchymatous cells gives rise to a gelatinous substance in which
    needle-like crystals of silica may be deposited, from a siliceous
    solution, in a matrix which has resulted from bacterial activity. In
    some of the sections of tissues figured by Renault<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> the outlines of
    a few cells are still indicated by fragments of the partially decayed
    wall, while in other cells the walls have been completely destroyed by
    Bacteria of which some are preserved in the centre of the cell-area,
    forming a kind of nucleus to the siliceous spherulites.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">BACILLI.</div>

  <p>In addition to the <i>Micrococcus</i> described by Renault from the
    Toula paper-coal, there are a host of other forms which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>have been
    minutely diagnosed and figured by Profs. Renault and Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.
    These authors have discovered what they believe to be well-defined
    species of <i>Micrococcus</i> and <i>Bacillus</i> ranging in age from
    Devonian to Jurassic. The material which has afforded the somewhat
    startling results of their investigations consists partly of the
    coprolites of reptiles and fishes, and of silicified and calcified
    plant tissues.</p>

  <h5 id="Bacillus_Permicus"><i>Bacillus Permicus.</i> Ren. and Bert.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> (Fig. 28 B.)</h5>

  <p>This <i>Bacillus</i>, which was discovered in sections of a Permian
    coprolite from Central France, has the form of cylindrical rods
    12–14µ in length, and 1·3–1·5µ broad, rounded at each end. The rods
    occur either singly or occasionally, two or three individuals are
    joined end to end. Fig. 28 B represents a piece of one of Renault and
    Bertrand’s sections; the small rods are clearly seen lying in various
    directions in the homogeneous matrix of the coprolite. Each individual
    is said to be surrounded by an extremely minute empty space ·4µ in
    width, originally occupied by the Bacillus membrane, the central
    rod representing the mineralised cell-contents. In this example the
    petrifying substance was probably derived from the phosphate of calcium
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>of bones which were attacked by Bacteria. I am indebted to Prof.
    Renault for an opportunity of examining specimens of this and other
    fossil Bacteria, and in this particular case there is undoubtedly
    strong evidence in favour of the author’s determination.</p>

  <p>Renault has given the name <i>Bacillus Tieghemi</i> to certain minute
    rods 6–10µ, in length, and 2·2–3·8µ broad, often containing a dark
    coloured spherical spore-like body 2µ in diameter, which have been

  <p>A portion of one of Renault’s figures is reproduced in Fig. 28 A. The
    faint and broken lines mark the position of the middle lamellae of

    almost completely destroyed, but the more resistant middle lamellae
    have been partially preserved. The short and broad rods represent what
    Renault terms <i>Bacillus Tieghemi</i>; the small circle in the middle
    of some of these being referred to as a spore, and in one specimen
    shown in the figure, the second rod at right angles to the first is
    described as a small daughter-Bacillus formed by the germination of the
    central spore.</p>

  <p id="Fossil_Bacteria">It is unnecessary to give an account of the numerous examples of
    <i>Micrococci</i> and <i>Bacilli</i> described by Renault from
    Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian and Jurassic rocks. We may, however,
    in a few words consider the general question of the existence and
    possible determination of fossil Bacteria.</p>

  <p>In 1877 Prof. Van Tieghem<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> of Paris drew attention to the method
    of operation and plan of attack of <i>Bacillus amylobacter</i> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>as a
    destructive agent in the decay of plant débris in water. He was able
    to follow the gradual disorganisation of the tissues and the various
    steps in the ‘butyric fermentation’ effected by this <i>Bacterium</i>.
    Similarly the same author<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> was able to detect the action of an
    allied organism in some silicified tissues from the Carboniferous
    nodules of Grand-Croix, a well-known locality for petrified plants near
    Saint-Étienne. He recognised also the traces of the <i>Bacillus</i>
    itself in the partially destroyed plant tissues. The Palaeozoic
    Bacteria made use of some cellulose-dissolving ferment of which the
    action is clearly demonstrated in sections of silicified tissues.
    Many of the phenomena described by Renault and Bertrand as due to
    similar Bacterial action, afford additional evidence that the gradual
    disorganisation of vegetable tissues was effected in precisely the same
    manner as at the present day.</p>

  <p>In some cases we have I believe trustworthy examples of the Bacteria
    themselves, both in coprolites and plant-tissues, but it is more
    than probable that some of the recorded examples are not of any
    scientific value. The examination of petrified tissues under the
    higher powers of a microscope often reveals the existence of numerous
    spherical particles and rod-like bodies which agree in shape with
    <i>Micrococci</i> or <i>Bacilli</i>. Minute crystals of mineral
    substances may occur in the siliceous or calcareous matrix of a
    petrified plant which simulate minute organic forms. Vogelsang<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
    in his important work <cite>die Krystalliten</cite> has thrown considerable
    light on the ontogeny of crystals, and the minute globulites and other
    forms of incipient crystallisation might well be mistaken for Bacterial
    cells. Granting, however, that we have satisfactory evidence, both
    direct and indirect, that some forms of Bacteria lived in the decaying
    tissues of Palaeozoic plants, and in the intestines of reptiles and
    other animals, we cannot safely proceed to specific diagnoses and
    determinations<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

  <p>Renault has pointed out that fossil Bacteria may often be more readily
    detected than living forms owing to the presence of a brown ulmic
    substance which results from the carbonisation of the protoplasm. He
    is forced to admit, however, that such diagnostic characters as are
    obtained by Bacteriologists by means of cultures cannot be utilised
    when we are dealing with fossil examples! We are told that “Partout où
    nous avons cherché des Bacteriaceés, nous en avons rencontré.”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
    This indeed is the danger; an extended examination of fossil sections
    under an immersion-lens must almost inevitably lead to the discovery of
    minute bodies of a more or less spherical form which <em>might</em> be
    <i>Micrococci</i>. To measure, and name such bodies as definite species
    of <i>Micrococci</i> is, I believe, but wasted energy and an attempt to
    compass the impossible.</p>

  <p>Specialists tell us that the accurate determination of species of
    recent Bacteria is practically hopeless: may we not reasonably conclude
    that the attempt to specifically diagnose fossil forms is absolutely
    hopeless? “The imagination of man is naturally sublime, delighted with
    whatever is remote and extraordinary—”, but it is to be deplored if the
    fascination of fossil bacteriology is allowed to warp sound scientific
    sense.</p>

  <p>The presence of chlorophyll is one common characteristic of the
    numerous plants included in the Algae. The generally adopted
    classification rests in part on an artificial distinction, namely the
    prevailing colour of the plant.</p>

  <p>It must be definitely admitted, at the outset, that palaeobotany has
    so far afforded extremely little trustworthy information as to the
    past history of algae. Were we to measure <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>the importance of the
    geological history of these plants by the number of recorded fossil
    species, we should arrive at a totally wrong and misleading estimate.
    By far the greater number of the supposed fossil algae have no claim
    to be regarded as authentic records of this class of Thallophytes. It
    has been justly said that palaeontologists have been in the habit of
    referring to algae such impressions or markings on rocks as cannot well
    be included in any other group. “A fossil alga,” has often been the
    <i lang="fr">dernier ressort</i> of the doubtful student.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">LARGE SEAWEEDS.</div>

  <p>Before discussing our knowledge, or rather lack of knowledge, of
    fossil algae at greater length, it will be well to briefly consider
    the manner of occurrence and botanical nature of existing forms. In
    the sea and in fresh water, as well as in damp places and even in
    situations subject to periods of drought, algae occur in abundance in
    all parts of the world. We find them attaining full development and
    reproducing themselves at a temperature of −1° C. in the Arctic Seas,
    and again living in enormous numbers in the waters of thermal springs.
    Around the coast-line of land areas, and on the floor of shallow seas
    algae exhibit a remarkable wealth of form and luxuriance of growth.
    As regards habit and structure, there is every gradation from algae
    in which the whole individual consists of a thin-walled unseptate
    vesicle, to those in which the thallus attains a length unsurpassed by
    any other plant, and of which the anatomical features clearly express
    a well-marked physiological division of labour such as occurs in the
    highest plants.</p>

  <p>The large and leathery seaweeds which flourish in the extreme northern
    and southern seas are plants which it is reasonable to suppose might
    well have left traces of their existence in ancient sediments. Sir
    Joseph Hooker, in his account of the Antarctic flora<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>, investigated
    during Sir James Ross’s voyage in H.M. ships Erebus and Terror, has
    given an exceedingly interesting description of the gigantic brown
    seaweeds of southern latitudes. The trunks are described as usually
    5–10 feet long, and as thick as a human thigh, dividing towards the
    summit into numerous pendulous branches which are again broken up
    into sprays with linear ‘leaves.’ Hooker <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>records how a captain of
    a brig employed his crew for two bitterly cold days in collecting
    <i>Lessonia</i> stems which had been washed up on the beach, thinking
    they were trunks of trees fit for burning. On our own coasts we are
    familiar with the common <i>Laminaria</i>, the large brown seaweed
    with long and strap-shaped or digitate fronds which grows on the rocks
    below low-tide level. The frond passes downwards into a thick and tough
    stipe firmly attached to the ground by special holdfasts. A transverse
    section of the stalk of a fairly old plant presents an appearance not
    unlike that of a section of a woody plant. In the centre there is a
    well-defined axial region or pith consisting of thick walled, long and
    narrow tubes pursuing a generally vertical though irregular course,
    and embedded in a matrix of gelatinous substance derived from the
    mucilaginous degeneration of the outer portions of the cell-walls. The
    greater part of such a section consists, however, of regularly disposed
    rows of cells which have obviously been formed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> activity of a
    zone of dividing or meristematic elements. The occurrence of distinct
    concentric rings in this secondary tissue clearly points to some
    periodicity of growth which is expressed by the alternation of narrow
    and broader cells. In the Antarctic genus <i>Lessonia</i>, the stem
    reaches a girth equal to that of a man’s thigh, and in structure it
    agrees closely with the smaller stem of <i>Laminaria</i>. In these
    large algal stems, the cells are not lignified as in woody plants,
    and in longitudinal section they have for the most part the form of
    somewhat elongated parenchyma, differing widely in appearance from
    the tracheids or vessels of woody plants. At the periphery of the
    <i>Laminaria</i> stem, represented in fig. 29, there occur numerous and
    comparatively large mucilage ducts.</p>

      tissue between the central ‘pith’ and ‘cortex’ showing the
      radially disposed secondary elements more highly magnified.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In certain algae of different families the thallus is encrusted with
    carbonate of lime, and is thus rendered much more resistant. The
    Diatoms, on the other hand, possess still more durable siliceous tests
    which are particularly well adapted to resist the solvent action of
    water and other agents of destruction. It is these calcareous and
    siliceous forms which supply the greater part of the trustworthy data
    furnished by fossil algae.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">SCARCITY OF FOSSIL ALGAE.</div>

  <p>It remains to consider some of the causes to which we may attribute
    the scarcity of fossil algae, and the possible sources of error which
    beset any attempt to describe or assign names to impressions and casts
    simulating algal forms.</p>

  <p>In the first place, the delicate nature of algal cells is a serious
    obstacle to fossilisation. Even in plants in which the woody stems have
    been preserved by a siliceous or calcareous solution, we frequently
    find the more delicate cells represented by a mass of crystalline
    matter without any trace of the cell-walls being preserved. In such
    plants as algae, where the cell-walls are not lignified, but consist of
    cellulose or some special form of cellulose, which readily breaks down
    into a mucilaginous product, the tissues have but a small chance of
    withstanding the wear and tear of fossilisation.</p>

  <p>The danger of relying on external form as a means of recognition is
    especially patent in the case of those numerous markings or impressions
    frequently met with on rocks, and which resemble in outline the
    thallus of recent algae. Among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> animals, such as certain Polyzoa, the
    flat branching body of various algae is closely simulated, and in
    other plants, such as the frondose liverworts, the same thalloid and
    branched form of body is again met with. Some of the much dissected
    <i>Aphlebia</i> leaves of ferns (e.g. <i>Rhacophyllum</i> species) bear
    a striking resemblance to fossil algae; and numerous other examples
    might be quoted. In palaeobotanical literature we find a host of names,
    such as <i>Chondrites</i>, <i>Fucoides</i><a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>, <i>Caulerpites</i>
    and others applied to indefinite and indistinct surface markings which
    happen to resemble in shape certain of the better known genera of
    recent seaweeds.</p>

  <p>The close parallelism in outward form displayed by different genera
    and families of algae is in itself sufficient argument against the
    use of recent generic names for fossils of which the algal nature
    is often more than doubtful. Were external form to be accepted
    as a trustworthy guide, in the absence of internal structure and
    reproductive organs, such a genus as <i>Caulerpa</i><a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> would
    afford material for numerous generic designations. A comparison of
    the different species of this Siphoneous green alga brings out very
    clearly the exceedingly protean nature of this interesting genus, and
    serves as one instance among many of the small taxonomic value which
    can be attached to external configuration. <i>Caulerpa pusilla</i>
    Mart. and Her., <i>C. taxifolia</i> (Vahl.), <i>C. plumaris</i> Forsk.,
    <i>C. abies-marina</i> J. Ag., <i>C. ericifolia</i> (Turn.), <i>C.
    hypnoides</i> (R. Br.), <i>C. cactoides</i> (Turn.), <i>C. scalpelli
    formis</i> (R. Br.), and others clearly illustrate the almost endless
    variety of form exhibited by the species of a single genus of algae.
    We constantly find in the several classes of plants a repetition of
    the same form either in the whole or in the separate members of the
    vegetative body, and but a slight acquaintance with plant types should
    lead us to use the test of external resemblance with the greatest
    possible caution. To emphasize this danger may seem merely the needless
    reiteration of a self-evident fact, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>but there is, perhaps, no source
    of error which has been more responsible for the creation of numerous
    worthless species among fossil plants.</p>

  <p>There is, however, another category of impressions and casts of common
    occurrence in sedimentary rocks which requires a brief notice. Very
    many of the fossil algae described in text-books and palaeobotanical
    memoirs have been shown to be of animal origin, and to be merely
    the casts of tracks and burrows. A few examples will best serve to
    illustrate the identity of many of the fossils referred to algae with
    animal trails and with impressions produced by inorganic agency.</p>

  <p>Dr Nathorst of Stockholm has done more than any other worker
    to demonstrate the true nature of many of the species of
    <i>Chondrites</i>, <i>Cruziana</i>, <i>Spirophyton</i>,
    <i>Eophyton</i>, and numerous other genera. In 1867 there were
    discovered in certain Cambrian beds of Vestrogothia, long convex and
    furrowed structures in sandstone rocks which were described as the
    remains of some comparatively highly organised plant, and described
    under the generic name <i>Eophyton</i><a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>. By many authors these
    fossils have been referred to algae, but Nathorst has shown that the
    frond of an alga trailed along the surface of soft plaster of Paris
    produces a finely furrowed groove (fig. 30, 2) which would afford a
    cast similar to that of <i>Eophyton</i>. The same author has also
    adduced good reasons for believing that the Eophytons of Cambrian rocks
    may represent the trails made by the tentacles of a <i>Medusa</i>
    having a habit similar to that of <i>Polydonia frondosa</i> Ag.
    Impressions of <i>Medusae</i> have been described by Nathorst from
    the beds in which <i>Eophyton</i> occurs; and the specimens in the
    Stockholm Museum afford a remarkable instance of the rare preservation
    of a soft-bodied organism<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>. By allowing various animals to crawl
    over a soft-prepared surface it is possible to obtain moulds and casts
    which suggest in a striking manner the branched thallus of an alga. The
    tracks of the Polychaet, <i>Goniada maculata</i> Örstd.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>, one of
    the Glyceridae, are always branched and very algal-like in form (fig.
    30, 3). <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>Many of the so-called fossil algae are undoubtedly mere tracks
    or trails of this type. In the fossil-plant gallery of the British
    Museum there are several specimens of small branched casts, clearly
    marked as whitish fossils on a dark grey rock of Lower Eocene age
    from Bognor; these were described by Mantell and Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> as an
    alga, but there is little doubt of their being of the same category as
    the track shown in fig. 30, 3.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">FOSSILS SIMULATING ALGAE.</div>

  <p>The well-known half-relief casts met with in Cambrian, Silurian and
    Carboniferous rocks, and known as <i>Cruziana</i> or Bilobites, are
    probably casts of the tracks of Crustaceans. The impression left
    by a King-Crab (<i>Limulus</i>) as it walks over a soft surface
    affords an example of this form of cast. It has been suggested
    that some of the Bilobites may be the casts of an organism like
    <i>Balanoglossus</i><a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>, a worm-like animal supposed by some
    to have vertebrate affinities. The resemblance between some of
    the lower Palaeozoic Bilobites and the external features of a
    <i>Balanoglossus</i> is very striking, and such a comparison is
    worth considering in view of the fact that soft-bodied animals have
    occasionally left distinct impressions on ancient sediments.</p>

  <p>The literature on the subject of fossil algae <i>versus</i> inorganic
    and animal markings is too extensive and too wearisome to consider in
    a short summary; the student will find a sufficient amount of such
    controversial writing—with references to more—in the works quoted
    below<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>.</p>

  <p>In the Stockholm Museum of Palaeobotany there is an exceedingly
    interesting collection of plaster casts obtained by Dr Nathorst
    in his experiments on the manufacture of fossil ‘algae,’ which
    afford convincing proof of the value and correctness of his general
    conclusions.</p>

  <p>The pressure of the hand on a soft moist surface produces a raised
    pattern like a branched and delicate thallus. The well-known
    <i>Oldhamia antiqua</i> Forbes and <i>Oldhamia radiata</i> Forbes<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>,
    from the Cambrian rocks of Ireland may, in part at least, owe their
    origin to mechanical causes, and we have no sufficient <span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>evidence for
    including them among the select class of true fossil algae. Sollas<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
    has shown that the structure known as <i>Oldhamia radiata</i> is not
    merely superficial but that it extends across the cleavage-planes.
    <i>Oldhamia</i> is recorded from Lower Palaeozoic rocks in the
    Pyrenees<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> by Barrois, who agrees with Salter, Göppert and others
    in classing the fossil among the algae. The photograph accompanying
    Barrois’ description does not, however, add further evidence in favour
    of accepting <i>Oldhamia</i> as a genus of fossil algae.</p>

  <p>The burrows made by <i>Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i> Latr., the
    Mole-cricket, have been shown by Zeiller to bear a close resemblance
    to a branch of a conifer in half-relief (fig. 30, 4), or to such a
    supposed algal genus as <i>Phymatoderma</i><a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.</p>

  <p>In fig. 30, 1, we have what might well be described as a fossil
    alga. This is merely a cast of a miniature river-system such as one
    frequently sees cut out by the small rills of water flowing over a
    gently-sloping sandy beach. A cast figured and described by Newberry
    as an alga, <i>Dendrophycus triassicus</i><a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>, from the Trias of
    the Connecticut Valley, is practically identical with the rill-marks
    shown in fig. 30, 1. The cracks produced in drying and contracting
    sediment may form moulds in which casts are subsequently produced by
    the deposition of an overlying layer of sand, and such casts have
    been erroneously referred to algal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>impressions<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>. Dawson<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> has

      limestone, Dudley. From a specimen in the British Museum (V.

  </figure>

  <p>The specimen represented in fig. 31 affords an example of a fairly
    well-known fossil from the Wenlock limestone, originally described by
    Salter as <i>Chondrites verisimilis</i> Salt, from Dudley<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>. He
    regarded it as an alga, and the graphitic impression agrees closely in
    form with the thallus of some small seaweeds. A closer examination of
    the fossil reveals a curious and characteristic irregular wrinkling on
    the graphite surface, which suggests an organism of more chitinous and
    firmer material than that of an alga.</p>

  <p>A similar and probably an identical fossil is described and figured
    by Lapworth<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> in an appendix to a paper by Walter Keeping on
    the geology of Central Wales, under the name of <i>Odontocaulis
    Keepingi</i> Lap. and regarded as a dendroid graptolite. In any case
    we have no satisfactory grounds for including these fossils in the
    plant-kingdom.</p>

  <p>How then are we to recognise the traces of ancient algae? There is no
    golden rule, and we must admit the difficulty of separating real fossil
    algae from markings made by animal or mechanical agency. The presence
    of a carbonaceous film is occasionally a help, but its occurrence is
    no sure test of plant origin, nor is its absence a fatal objection
    to an organic origin. While being fully alive to the small value of
    external resemblance, and to the numerous agents which have been shown
    to be capable of producing appearances indistinguishable from plant
    impressions, we must not go too far in a purely negative direction.</p>

  <p>An important contribution to the subject of fossil algae has lately
    appeared by Prof. Rothpletz<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>. He deals more particularly with
    the much discussed Flysch<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Fucoids of Tertiary age, and while
    refusing to accept certain examples as fossil algae, he brings forward
    weighty arguments in favour of including several other forms among
    the algae. He is of opinion that most of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>main divisions of the
    algae are represented among the Flysch Fucoids, but considers that the
    Phaeophyceae are the most numerous.</p>

  <p>Rothpletz’s work is chiefly interesting as illustrating the application
    of microscopic examination and chemical analysis to the determination
    of fossil algae. Although he makes out a good case in favour of
    restoring many of the Tertiary fossils to the plant kingdom, the
    material at his disposal does not admit of satisfactory botanical
    diagnosis.</p>

  <p>No doubt some of the fossils from the Silurian and Cambrian rocks are
    true algae, and Nathorst has pointed out that such a species as Hall’s
    <i>Sphenothallus angustifolius</i><a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> may well be an alga. Additional
    examples might be quoted from Bornemann and other writers, but in view
    of the attempts which are sometimes made to trace the development of
    more recent plants to more than doubtful Lower Palaeozoic Algae, one
    must agree with Nathorst’s opinion,—“Je crois que l’on rend un bien
    mauvais service à la théorie de l’évolution, en essayant de baser
    l’arbre généalogique des algues fossiles sur des corps aussi douteux
    que les Bilobites, Crossochorda, Eophyton, etc.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>”</p>

  <p>There are many carbonaceous impressions on rocks of different ages
    which it is reasonable to refer to algal origin, and although such
    are of little or no botanical value, it may be a convenience to
    refer to them under a definite term. The comprehensive generic name
    <i>Algites</i><a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> has been suggested as a convenient designation for
    impressions or casts which are probably those of algae.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">SUPPOSED FOSSIL ALGAE.</div>

  <p>Some of the fossils described by Mr Kidston from British Carboniferous
    rocks as probably algae present an undoubted algal appearance, and
    might be placed in the genus <i>Algites</i>; but in some cases—e.g.
    <i>Chondrites plumosa</i><a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Kidst. from the Calciferous Sandstone of
    Eskdale, one feels much more doubtful; in this particular instance the
    impressions suggest the fine roots of a water-plant.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

  <p>The statement is occasionally made that the numerous fossil algae
    and the absence of higher plants in the older strata justify the
    description of the oldest rocks as belonging to the ‘age of algae.’
    Such an assertion rests on an unsound basis, and is rather the
    expression of what might be expected than what has been proved to
    be the case. The oldest plants with which we are at all closely
    acquainted are of such a type as to forcibly suggest that in the lowest
    fossiliferous rocks we are still very far from the sediments of that
    age which witnessed the dawn of plant life.</p>

  <p>Many of the obscure markings on rock surfaces which have been referred
    to existing genera of algae or described as new genera, are much
    too doubtful to be included even under such a comprehensive name
    as <i>Algites</i>. Space does not admit of further reference to
    determinations of this type which abound in palaeontological literature.</p>

  <p>It would be very difficult to produce satisfactory evidence for the
    algal nature of many of the supposed fossil algae from Cambrian
    rocks<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>; there has been a special tendency to recognise algal
    remains in the oldest fossiliferous strata, due in part no doubt to
    the fallacy that in that period nothing higher than Thallophytes
    is likely to have existed. The so-called <i>Phycodes</i> referred
    to by Credner<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> as characteristic of the Cambrian rocks of the
    Fichtelgebirge (“Phycoden-Schiefer”) is probably of inorganic origin,
    and comparable to the genus <i>Vexillum</i> of Saporta<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> and other
    writers, which Solms-Laubach has described as being formed every day
    in the soft mud of our ponds where local currents are checked by
    branches and other obstacles<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>. There are several good specimens of
    <i>Phycodes</i> in the Bergakademie of Berlin and in the Leipzig Museum
    which, I believe, clearly demonstrate the absence of all satisfactory
    evidence of an algal origin.</p>

  <p>We may next pass to a short description of a few representative types
    of algae, which may reasonably be classed under <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>definite families, and
    accepted as evidence possessing some botanical value.</p>

  <h4 id="DIATOMACEAE">A. DIATOMACEAE (<span class="smcap">Bacillariaceae</span>).</h4>

  <p>This family occupies a somewhat isolated position among the algae, and
    is best considered as a distinct subdivision rather than as a family of
    the Phaeophyceae or Brown algae, with which it possesses as a common
    characteristic a brown-colouring matter.</p>

  <p>Single-celled plants consisting of a simple protoplasmic body
    containing a nucleus and brown colouring matter (diatomin) associated
    with the chlorophyll. The cell-wall is in the form of two halves, known
    as <em>valves</em>, which fit into one another like the two portions
    of a pill-box. The cell-wall contains a large amount of silica, and
    the siliceous cases of the diatoms are commonly spoken of as the
    valves of the individual, or the <em>frustules</em>. Diatoms exhibit a
    characteristic creeping movement, and are reproduced by division, also
    by the development of spores in various forms<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.</p>

  <p>The recent members of the family have an exceedingly wide distribution,
    occurring both in freshwater and in the sea. Owing to the lightness
    of the frustules, they are frequently carried along in the air, and
    atmospheric dust falling on ships at sea has been found to contain
    large numbers of diatoms<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>. The siliceous valves are abundant
    in guano deposits, and they have been found also in association
    with volcanic material. Diatomaceous deposits are now being formed
    in the Yellowstone Park district; “they cover many square miles in
    the vicinity of active or extinct hot spring vents of the park, and
    are often three feet, four feet, and sometimes five to six feet
    thick<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.” The gradual accumulation of the siliceous tests on the
    floor of a fresh-water lake results in the formation of a sediment
    consisting in part of pure silica. Such deposits, often spoken of
    as <em>kieselguhr</em> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>or <em>diatomite</em>, and used as a polishing
    material, occur in many parts of Britain, marking the sites of dried-up
    pools or lakes. At the northern end of the island of Skye there
    occurs an unusually pure deposit of diatomite overlain by peat and
    turf, and extending over an area of fifty-eight square miles. Many
    of the individuals in this deposit were in all probability carried
    into the lake by running water, while others lived in the lake and
    after death their tests contributed to the siliceous deposit<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>.
    The late Dr Ehrenberg published numerous papers on diatomaceous
    deposits in different parts of the world, and in his great work, <cite>Zur
    Mikrogeologie</cite><a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>, he gave numerous and beautifully executed
    illustrations of such siliceous accumulations. In many of the samples
    he figures one sees fragments of plant tissues, spores of conifers
    and ferns, associated with the diatom tests. The occurrence of the
    pollen grains of coniferous trees in lacustrine and marine deposits
    is not surprising in view of their abundance in Lake Constance and
    other lakes. It is stated that the pollen of conifers in the Norwegian
    fiords plays an important part in the nourishment of the Rhizopod
    <i>Saccamina</i><a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">DIATOMACEOUS OOZE.</div>

  <p>In the waters of the ocean diatoms are of frequent occurrence, and
    very widely distributed. Sir Joseph Hooker records the existence of
    masses of diatomaceous ooze over a wide area in Antarctic regions<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.
    Along the shores of the Victoria Barrier, a perpendicular wall of ice,
    between one and two hundred feet above sea-level, the soundings were
    found to be invariably charged with diatom remains, and from the base
    of the ice-wall there appeared to be in process of formation a bank
    of these tests stretching north for a distance of 200 miles. The more
    extended researches conducted during the cruise of the Challenger
    have clearly proved the enormous accumulations of diatoms now being
    formed on the ocean-bed<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. South of latitude 45° S. there is now
    being built up a vast deposit which may be eventually upraised as a
    fairly pure siliceous rock. From extreme northern latitudes Nansen has
    recently <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>recorded the occurrence of these lowly organised plants.
    He writes,—“I found a whole world of diatoms and other microscopical
    organisms, both vegetable and animal, living in the fresh-water pools
    on the Polar drift-ice, and constantly travelling from Siberia to the
    east coast of Greenland<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>.” In warmer latitudes diatoms abound in
    the surface waters, but there they are associated with numerous other
    forms of the Plankton vegetation. The waters of the Amazon carry with
    them into the sea large numbers of fresh-water forms, which are floated
    out to sea and finally added to the rock-building material which is
    constantly accumulating on the ocean floor<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>. No definite results
    have so far been obtained as to the geographical and bathymetrical
    distribution of marine diatoms.</p>

  <p>The enormous number of recent species precludes any attempt to give
    a description of the better-known forms. It is more important for us
    to realize how common and widely distributed are the living genera.
    The hard and almost indestructible valves have been frequently found
    in a fossil condition, often forming thick and extensive masses of
    siliceous rock. From diatom-beds now forming in lakes and on the
    ocean-bed we pass to deposits such as those in Skye and elsewhere,
    which mark the site of recently dried-up sheets of water, and so to
    older rocks of Tertiary age formed under similar conditions. Among
    the many examples of diatomaceous deposits of Tertiary and Cretaceous
    age mention should be made of those of Berlin, Königsberg, Bilin in
    Bohemia, and Richmond in Virginia. The diatoms in the beds of Berlin
    are regarded as fresh-water, and those of Richmond as marine. It has
    been pointed out by Pfitzer that it is a comparatively easy matter
    to distinguish between fresh-water and marine forms of diatoms. The
    diatomaceous rocks of Bilin are known as polishing slates; they attain
    a thickness of 50 feet. In these, as in many other cases, the deposit
    has become cemented together as a hard flinty or glassy rock, in which
    the cementing material was formed by the solution of some of the diatom
    tests<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>. In many cases in which calcareous and siliceous rocks
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>reveal no direct evidence of organic origin it is probable that they
    were originally formed by the accumulation of plants of which the
    structure has been completely obliterated by secondary causes. The
    genus <i>Gallionella</i> plays an important part in the composition of
    the Bilin beds. Occasionally impressions of leaves and other organic
    remains are found associated with the diatoms in the siliceous rocks.
    In the British Museum (Botanical department) a large block of white
    powdery rock is exhibited as an example of a diatomaceous deposit of
    Tertiary age from Australia. It is described as being largely made
    up of the tests of fresh-water diatoms, such as <i>Navicula</i>,
    <i>Gomphonema</i>, <i>Cymbella</i>, <i>Synedra</i>, and others.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">FOSSIL DIATOMS.</div>

  <p>The abundance of Diatoms in Cretaceous rocks of the Paris basin has
    recently been recorded by Cayeux<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>; it would seem that these algae
    had already assumed an important rôle as rock-builders in pre-Tertiary
    times. Cayeux points out that the silica of these Cretaceous
    diatomaceous frustules has often been replaced by carbonate of calcium.</p>

  <p>In addition to the occurrence of Diatoms in the various diatomaceous
    deposits, their siliceous tests may occasionally be recognised in
    argillaceous or other sediments. Shrubsole and Kitton<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> have
    described several species of Diatoms from the London Clay of Lower
    Eocene age. In many localities in the London basin the clay obtained
    from well-sinkings presented the appearance of being dusted with
    sulphur-like particles of a dark bronze or golden colour which
    glistened in the sunlight. These yellow bodies have been found to be
    diatomaceous frustules in which the silica has been replaced by iron
    pyrites. The genus <i>Coscinodiscus</i> is one of the commonest forms
    recorded from the London Clay<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.</p>

  <p>Without further considering individual examples of diatomaceous rocks
    we may briefly notice the general facts of the geological history of
    the family. As Ehrenberg pointed out several years ago, the Tertiary
    and Cretaceous species of diatoms show a very marked resemblance to
    living forms. In <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>many cases the species are identical, and the fossil
    deposits as a whole seem to differ in no special respect from those now
    being built up.</p>

  <p>With the exception of two species of Liassic Diatoms, no trustworthy
    examples of the Diatomaceae have been found below the Cretaceous
    series. The oldest known Diatoms were discovered by Rothpletz<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
    among the fibres of an Upper Lias sponge from Boll in Württemberg.
    They occur as small thimble-shaped siliceous tests with coccoliths and
    foraminifera in the horny skeleton of <i>Phymatoderma</i>, a genus
    formerly regarded as an alga. Rothpletz describes two species which he
    includes in the genus <i>Pyxidicula</i>, <i>P. bollensis</i> and <i>P.
    liasica</i>. This generic name of Ehrenberg is used by Schütt<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> as a
    subgenus of <i>Stephanopyxis</i>.</p>

  <p>Seeing how great a resemblance there is between the recent and
    Cretaceous species, and how many examples there are of Tertiary diatom
    deposits, it is not a little surprising that the past history of these
    plants has not been traced to earlier periods. In 1876 Castracane<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>,
    an Italian diatomist, gave an account of certain species of diatoms
    said to have been found in a block of coal from Liverpool obtained
    from the English Coal-Measures. The species were found to be identical
    with recent forms. It is generally agreed that these specimens
    cannot have been from the coal itself, but that they must have been
    living forms which had come to be associated with the coal. The late
    Prof. Williamson spent many years examining thin sections and other
    preparations of coal from various parts of the world, but he never
    found a trace of any fossil diatom. There is no apparent reason
    why diatoms should not be found in Pre-Cretaceous rocks, and the
    microscopic investigation of old sediments may well lead to their
    discovery. Prof. Bertrand of Lille, who has devoted himself for some
    time past to a detailed microscopical examination of coal, informs
    me that he has so far failed to discover any trace of Palaeozoic
    diatomaceous tests.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">BACTRYLLIUM.</div>

  <p>The genus <i>Bactryllium</i> is often quoted in text-books as a
    probable example of a Triassic diatom. It was first described <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>by
    Heer<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> from the Trias of Switzerland and North Italy, also from the
    neighbourhood of Heidelberg, and regarded as an extinct member of the
    Diatomaceae. Heer defined the genus as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Small bodies, with parallel sides, rounded at either end, the
      surface traversed by one or two longitudinal grooves.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="noindent">(fig. 32, C.) Several species have been figured by Heer
    from beds of Muschelkalk, Keuper and Rhaetic age. He describes the wall
    as thick and firm (fig. 32, C. ii.) and probably composed of silica,
    with a hollow interior. The specimen shown in fig. 32, C. was found
    in the Rhaetic beds, and named by Heer <i>Bactryllium deplanatum</i>;
    it has a length of 4·5 mm.; the surface is transversely striated and
    traversed by a single longitudinal groove. Stefani<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> has given
    reasons in favour of removing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span><i>Bactryllium</i> from the plant to
    the animal kingdom; he points out that the specimens are too large for
    diatoms, and moreover that they are asymmetrical in form and possessed
    a calcareous and not a siliceous shell. He would place the fossil
    among the Pteropods, comparing it with such genera as <i>Cuvierina</i>
    and <i>Hyalaea</i>. In view of Stefani’s opinion we cannot attach any
    importance to this supposed diatom, especially as it has generally been
    regarded as at best but an unsatisfactory genus.</p>

  <h4 id="CHLOROPHYCEAE">B. CHLOROPHYCEAE (<span class="smcap">Green Algae</span>).</h4>

  <p>Thallus unseptate, having the form of a vesicle or a variously branched
    coenocyte, which may or may not be encrusted with carbonate of lime, or
    of filaments composed of cells containing a single nucleus, or of cells
    in which more than one nucleus occurs; in other instances consisting
    of a plate of cells or a cell-mass. Asexual reproduction by zoospores
    and other reproductive cells; sexual reproduction by means of the
    conjugation of similar gametes or by the fertilisation of a typical
    egg-cell by a motile spermatozoid.</p>

  <p>This family of algae is represented at the present day by numerous
    and widely distributed marine and fresh-water genera, as well as by
    genera growing in moist air or as endophytes in the tissues of higher
    plants<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>.</p>

  <p>Seeing how very few fossil forms have been described which have any
    claim to inclusion in this subdivision of the Algae, it is unnecessary
    to enumerate or define the various families of the Chlorophyceae. It
    is true that many species have been figured as examples of different
    genera of green algae, but few of these possess any scientific value.
    There is, however, one division of the Chlorophyceae, the Siphoneae,
    which must be treated at some length on account of its importance from
    a palaeobotanical and geological point of view.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>
  <h5 id="Siphoneae"><i>a.</i> <span class="smcap">Siphoneae.</span></h5>

  <p>Thallus consisting of simple or branched cells very rarely divided
    by septa, and containing many nuclei. In certain genera the branches
    form a pseudoparenchymatous tissue by their repeated branching, and
    as a result of the intimate felting together of the branched cells.
    Reproduction is effected either by the conjugation of similar gametes
    or by the fertilisation of an egg-cell.</p>

  <p><i>Vaucheria</i> and <i>Botrydium</i> are two well-known British genera
    of this order, but most of the recent representatives live in tropical
    and subtropical seas. The most striking characteristic feature of
    this division of the Chlorophyceae is the fact that the thallus of a
    siphoneous alga consists of an unseptate coenocyte; the plant may be
    extremely small and simple, or it may reach a length of several inches,
    but in all cases the body does not consist of more than one cell or
    coenocyte.</p>

  <p>From a palaeontological standpoint the Siphoneae are of exceptional
    interest. It is impossible to do more than refer to a few of the living
    and fossil genera. There are numerous fossil representatives already
    known, and there can be little doubt that further research would be
    productive of valuable results.</p>

  <p>As examples of the order, a few genera may be described belonging to
    the three families Caulerpaceae, Codiaceae, and Dasycladaceae.</p>

  <h6 id="Caulerpaceae">α. Caulerpaceae.</h6>

  <p>Thallus unseptate, showing an extraordinary variation in the external
    differentiation of the plant-body. Reproduction is effected by means of
    detached portions of the parent plant.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Caulerpa</i>, represented by a few species in the
    Mediterranean and by many tropical forms, has already been alluded
    to as a striking example of a plant which appears under a great many
    different forms<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>. As a recent writer has said, “Nature seems to
    have shown in this genus the utmost possibilities of the siphoneous
    thallus<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>,” Fragments of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>coniferous twigs, the tracks and burrows
    of various animals and other objects have been described by several
    authors as fossil species of <i>Caulerpa</i>. As an illustration
    of the identification of a very doubtful fossil as a species of
    <i>Caulerpites</i>, reference may be made to such a form as <i>C.
    cactoides</i> Göpp.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> from Silurian and Cambrian rocks. There are
    several examples of this fossil in the Brussels Museum which probably
    owe their origin to some burrowing animal, and may be compared with
    Zeiller’s figures of the tunnels made by the mole-cricket (fig. 30,
    4)<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>.</p>

  <p>Mr Murray, of the British Museum, has recently described what he
    regards as a trustworthy example of a fossil <i>Caulerpa</i> from the
    Kimeridge Clay near Weymouth<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>. Specimens of the fossil were first
    figured in a book on the geology of the Dorset coast as casts of an
    equisetaceous plant<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>.</p>

  <p>To this fossil Murray has assigned the name <i>Caulerpa
    Carruthersi</i>, and given to it a scientific diagnosis. The best
    specimens have the form of a slender central axis, giving off at fairly
    regular intervals whorls of short and somewhat clavate branches; they
    bear a superficial resemblance to such a recent species as <i>Caulerpa
    cactoides</i> Ag. An examination of several examples of this fossil
    leads me to express the opinion that there is not sufficient reason
    for assigning to them the name of a recent genus of algae<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>. To use
    the generic name of a recent plant without following the common custom
    of adding on the termination “ites” (i.e. <i>Caulerpites</i>) is as a
    general rule to be avoided in dealing with fossil forms; and there are,
    I believe, no satisfactory grounds for referring to these fossils as
    trustworthy examples of a Mesozoic alga.</p>

  <p>In the present case I am disposed to regard the <i>Caulerpa</i>-like
    casts as of animal rather than plant origin. The clavate branches have
    the form of very deep moulds in the hard brown rock which have been
    filled in with blue mud. It is hardly conceivable that the branches of
    a soft watery plant such as <i>Caulerpa</i> could leave more than a
    faint impression on an old sea-floor. The specimens occur in different
    positions in the matrix <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>of the rock and they are not confined to
    the lines of bedding; in none of the examples is there any trace of
    carbonaceous matter in association with the deep moulds. On the whole,
    then, this Kimeridge fossil cannot, I believe, be accepted as an
    authentic example of a Mesozoic <i>Caulerpa</i>.</p>

  <p>It is not improbable that some of the supposed fossil algae may be
    casts of egg-cases or spawn-clusters of animals. In Ellis’ Natural
    History of the Corallines<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> there is a drawing representing a
    number of disc-like ovaries attached to a tough ligament, and referred
    to the mollusc <i>Buccinum</i>, which bears a certain resemblance to
    the Weymouth fossil. A similar body is figured by Fuchs<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> in an
    important memoir on supposed fossil algae.</p>

  <p>It is not suggested that the <i>Caulerpa Carruthersi</i> of Murray
    should be regarded as the cast of some molluscan egg-case attached to
    a slender axis, but it is important to bear in mind the possibility
    of matching such extremely doubtful fossils with other organic
    bodies than the thallus of a <i>Caulerpa</i>. In an example of an
    egg-case in the Cambridge Zoological Museum, referred to a species of
    <i>Pyrula</i>, there is a hard, long and slender axis, bearing a series
    of semicircular chambers divided into radial compartments. The whole is
    hard and horny and might well be preserved as a fossil.</p>

  <h6 id="Codiaceae">β. Codiaceae.</h6>

  <p>The members of this Order present a considerable diversity of form as
    regards the shape of the plant-body; the thallus of some species is
    encrusted with carbonate of lime. The order is widely distributed in
    tropical and temperate seas.</p>

  <p>Among the recent genera <i>Penicillus</i> and <i>Codium</i> may
    be chosen as important types from the point of view of fossil
    representatives.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Codium"><i>Codium.</i></div>

  <p>The thallus of <i>Codium</i> consists of a spongy mass of tubular
    cell-branches which are differentiated into two fairly distinct
    regions, an outer peripheral layer in which the branches have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>long
    club-shaped terminations, and an inner region consisting of loosely
    interwoven filaments.</p>

  <p><i>Codium Bursa</i> L. and <i>C. tomentosum</i> Huds. are two
    well-known British species, the former presents the appearance of a
    spongy ball of cells, and in the latter the thallus is divided up into
    dichotomously forked branches<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>. In this genus the thallus is not
    encrusted with carbonate of lime, at least in recent species.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Sphaerocodium"><i>Sphaerocodium.</i> Fig. 37, D.</div>

  <p>Rothpletz<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> instituted this genus for certain small spherical
    or oval bodies varying from 1 mm. to 2 cm. in diameter, which have
    been found on crinoid stems or shell fragments of Triassic age. Each
    spherical body consists of dichotomously branched single-celled
    filaments, between 50 and 100µ in breadth, and from 300–500µ in height.
    The tubular cavities occasionally swell out into spherical spaces which
    are regarded by Rothpletz as sporangia.</p>

  <p>There is not sufficient evidence that <i>Sphaerocodium Bornemanni</i>
    Roth. has been correctly referred to the Codiaceae. The sporangia-like
    swellings described by the author of the species are not by any means
    conclusive as characters of important taxonomic value. Figure 37, D,
    illustrates the general structure of the fossil as seen in a transverse
    section of one of the calcareous grains.</p>

  <p>Like <i>Girvanella</i>, which has been referred by some writers to the
    Siphoneae, <i>Sphaerocodium</i> occurs in the form of oolitic grains.
    In the Triassic Raibler and St Cassian beds of the Tyrol, as well as in
    rocks of Rhaetic age in the Eastern Alps, it makes up large masses of
    limestone. Rothpletz compares the structure of this genus with that of
    the recent alga <i>Codium adhaerens</i> Ag., but it is wiser to regard
    such tubular structures as <i>Girvanella</i>, <i>Siphonema</i><a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> and
    <i>Sphaerocodium</i> as closely allied organisms, which are probably
    algae, but too imperfectly known to be referred to any particular
    family.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

  <div class="h7" id="Penicillus"><i>Penicillus.</i></div>

  <p>The recent genus <i>Penicillus</i> is one of those algae formerly
    included among animals. Fig. 33, O, has been copied from a drawing of a
    species of <i>Penicillus</i> given by Lamouroux<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> under the generic
    name of <i>Nesea</i> in his treatise on the genera of Polyps published
    in 1821. He describes the genus as a brush-like Polyp with a simple
    stem.</p>

  <p>The thallus consists of a stout stem terminating in a brush-like tuft
    of fine dichotomously-branched filaments. The apical branches are
    divided by regular constrictions into short oval or rod-like segments
    which may be encrusted with carbonate of lime. A few of the segments
    from the terminal tuft of a recent <i>Penicillus</i> are shown in
    fig. 35, E. Each of these calcareous segments has the form of an oval
    shell perforated at each end, and the wall is pierced by numerous fine
    canals. <i>Penicillus</i> is represented by about 10 recent species,
    which with one exception live in tropical seas.</p>

  <p>The recognition of <i>Penicillus</i>, or a very similar type, in a
    fossil condition is due to Munier-Chalmas<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>. This keen observer has
    rendered great service to palaeobotany by directing attention to the
    calcareous algae in the Paris basin beds, and by proving that many of
    the fossils from these Tertiary deposits have been erroneously included
    by previous writers among the Foraminifera<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>. It is greatly to be
    desired that Prof. Munier-Chalmas may soon publish a monograph on the
    fossil Siphoneous forms of which he possesses a unique collection.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Ovulites"><i>Ovulites.</i> Figs. 33, K, L, and 35, F.</div>

  <p>In his Natural History of Invertebrate Animals, Lamarck described
    some small oval bodies from the Calcaire Grossier (Eocene) of the
    Paris basin under the name of <i>Ovulites</i>. He <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>defined them as
    follows:—“Polypier pierreux, libre, ovuliforme ou cylindracé, creux
    intérieurement, souvent percé aux deux bouts. Pores très petits,
    régulièrement disposés à la surface<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>.”</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The specimens are referred to two species, <i>Ovulites margaritula</i>
    and <i>O. elongata</i>.</p>

  <p>By some subsequent writers<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> these calcareous fossils, like
    miniature birds’ eggs with a hole at either end, were included
    among the Zoophytes. Carpenter and others afterwards referred
    <i>Ovulites</i> to the Foraminifera, and compared the genus with
    Lagena<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>. The single specimens of <i>Ovulites</i> have a length
    of 2–6 mm. At each end there is usually a fairly large and somewhat
    irregular hole (fig. 35, F), and in some rarer cases there may be
    two apertures at the broader end of an Ovulite. A good example of
    <i>Ovulites margaritula</i> with two pores at the broader end is
    figured by Michelin<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>. The surface of the shell when seen under a
    low magnifying power appears to be covered over with regularly arranged
    circular pores, which are the external openings of fine canals (fig. 33, L).</p>

  <p>In 1878 Munier-Chalmas expressed the opinion, which was supported
    by strong evidence, that <i>Ovulites</i> should be referred to the
    siphoneous algae<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>. He regarded it as generically identical with
    <i>Penicillus</i> (<i>Coralliodendron</i>, Kützing). It has already
    been pointed out that in <i>Penicillus</i> the apical tuft of filaments
    is partially calcareous (fig. 33, O)<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>. The individual calcareous
    segments agree almost exactly with the fossil <i>Ovulites</i>. As
    a rule the Ovulites occur as separate egg- or rod-like bodies, but
    Munier-Chalmas informs me that occasionally two or three have been
    found joined end to end in their natural position. The terminal
    holes in the fossil specimens represent the apertures left after the
    detachment of the calcareous segments from the uncalcified filaments of
    the alga. The segments with two holes at the broader end were no doubt
    situated at the base of dichotomising branches as shown in fig. 33,
    K. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>The restoration of <i>Ovulites</i>, shown in fig. 33, K, bears a
    striking resemblance to the figure of an Australian <i>Penicillus</i>
    given by Harvey in his <i>Phycologia Australica</i><a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>.</p>

  <p>It is probable that these Eocene forms agreed closely in habit with the
    recent species of <i>Penicillus</i>. The portions preserved as fossils
    are segments of the filaments which probably formed a terminal brush
    of fine branches supported on a stem. The retention of the original
    generic name <i>Ovulites</i> is on the whole better than the inclusion
    of the fossil species in the recent genus. The Tertiary species lived
    in warm seas of the Lower and Middle Eocene of England, Belgium, France
    and Italy.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Halimeda"><i>Halimeda.</i></div>

  <p>An example of an Eocene species of <i>Halimeda</i> has been
    recorded by Fuchs from Greifenstein under the name of <i>Halimeda
    Saportae</i><a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>. The impression has the form of a branched plant
    consisting of wedge-shaped or oval segments, and there is a close
    resemblance to the thallus of a recent <i>Halimeda</i>, e.g. <i>H.
    gracilis</i> Harv. It is not improbable that Fuchs’ determination is
    correct, but without more definite evidence than is afforded by a mere
    impression it is a little rash to make use of the recent generic name.</p>

  <h6 id="Dasycladaceae">γ. Dasycladaceae.</h6>

  <p>In this family of Siphoneae are included a number of genera represented
    by species living in tropical and subtropical seas.</p>

  <p>The thallus consists of an elongated axial cell fixed to the substratum
    by basal rhizoids, and bearing whorls of lateral appendages of limited
    growth which may be either simple or branched. Many of the lateral
    branches bear sporangia or spores. The thallus is in many species
    encrusted with carbonate of lime.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

  <p>The two genera <i>Acetabularia</i> and <i>Cymopolia</i> may be briefly
    described as recent types which are represented by trustworthy fossil
    forms.</p>

  <p>With the exception of <i>A. mediterranea</i> Lamx. (fig. 34) the few
    living species of this genus are confined to tropical seas.</p>

  <p>The habit of <i>Acetabularia</i> is well illustrated by the photograph
    of a cluster of plants of <i>A. mediterranea</i> Lamx.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> reproduced
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>in fig. 34. The thallus consists of a delicate stalk attached to
    the substratum by a tuft of basal holdfasts, and expanded distally
    into a small circular disc 10–12 mm. in diameter and more or less
    concave above. This terminal cap is made up of a number of laterally
    fused appendages given off from the upper part of the stalk in
    the form of a crowded whorl. The whole thallus resembles a small
    and long-stalked calcareous fungus. In each radially elongated
    compartment of the fertile cap (fig. 33, I) there are several sporangia
    (<i>gametangia</i>) developed; these eventually open and produce
    numerous ciliated gametes which give rise to zygospores by conjugation.
    Fig. 33, I, represents the cap of an <i>Acetabularia</i> in radial
    section and surface-view; the two radial compartments seen in section
    contain the elliptical gametangia; the circular markings at the base of
    the figure are scars of sterile deciduous branches.</p>

  <p>The whole plant is unicellular, each chamber in the disc being in open
    communication with the stem of the plant.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Acicularia"><i>Acicularia.</i> Fig. 33, C–H.</div>

  <p>In a recent monograph on the Acetabularieae, Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> has
    described a new type of these algae which is of special importance
    from the point of view of the past history of the family. Möbius
    described an example of <i>Acetabularia</i> in 1889 under the name
    <i>A. Schencki</i>; this species has since been placed in D’Archiac’s
    genus <i>Acicularia</i><a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>. <i>Acicularia Schencki</i><a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> bears
    a close resemblance as regards external form to <i>Acetabularia
    mediterranea</i>. In the latter species the walls of the terminal disc
    compartments are calcified, and the cavity of each of the laterally
    fused members contains numerous free spores; in <i>Acicularia</i>, the
    cavity of each disc-ray is occupied by a calcareous substance in the
    form of a spicule containing numerous cavities in each of which is a
    single sporangium. A single spicule is seen in fig. 33, H, showing the
    spherical pockets in which the sporangia were originally situated.
    This species, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span><i>Acicularia Schencki</i>, has been recorded from
    Martinique, Guadeloupe, Brazil, and a few other places.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Acicularia</i> was founded by D’Archiac for certain
    minute calcareous spicules found in the Eocene sands (Calcaire
    Grossier) of the Paris basin. D’Archiac describes one species,
    <i>Acicularia pavantina</i>, which he defines as follows:—“Polypier
    aciculaire, élargi, et légèrement comprimé à sa partie supérieure,
    qui est échancrée au milieu. Surface couverte de petits pores
    simples, nombreux, disposés irrégulièrement<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>.” The same species
    is figured also in Michelin’s <i>Iconographie Zoophytologique</i>,
    and described as an organism of which the exact zoological position
    is uncertain<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>. After these fossils had been placed in various
    divisions of the animal kingdom, Carpenter<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> described several
    specimens as portions of foraminifera. Finally, Munier-Chalmas removed
    <i>Acicularia</i> to the plant kingdom, and “with rare divination”
    placed the genus among the Acetabularieae. The history of our knowledge
    of the true nature of <i>Acicularia</i> is of unusual interest. Some
    of the specimens of this genus figured in Carpenter’s monograph have
    the form of imperfect long and narrow bodies tapering to a point at one
    end and broad at the other (fig. 33, F and G); they are joined together
    laterally and pitted with numerous small cavities. From the resemblance
    of such specimens to a fragment of the terminal fertile disc of the
    recent Acetabularias, Munier-Chalmas referred the fossils to this type
    of algae. In the living species which were then known the radiating
    chambers of the disc contained loose sporangia, without any calcareous
    matrix filling the cavity of the chambers. In the fossil Acicularias,
    on the other hand, the manner of preservation of the pitted calcareous
    spicules pointed to the occurrence of sporangia embedded in cavities
    in a calcareous matrix. Subsequent to Munier-Chalmas’ somewhat
    daring conclusions as to the relation of <i>Acicularia</i> to
    <i>Acetabularia</i>, Solms-Laubach found that the species originally
    described by Möbius as <i>Acetabularia Schencki</i> from Guadeloupe
    presented exactly those characters in which the fossil specimens
    differ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>from <i>Acetabularia</i>. The genus <i>Acicularia</i> formerly
    restricted to fossil species is now applied also to this single living
    species <i>Acicularia Schencki</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus is thus defined by Solms-Laubach:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p lang="la">“Discus fertilis terminalis e radiis inter se conjunctis formatus,
      coronis et inferiore et superiore praeditis, sporae massa mucosa
      calce incrustata coalitae, pro radio spiculam solidam cuneatam
      formantes<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As Solms-Laubach points out in his recent monograph, Munier-Chalmas’
    conjecture, “which had little to support it in the fossil material, has
    been more recently proved true in the most brilliant fashion by the
    discovery of a living species of this genus.”</p>

    species was first described by Andrussow<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> as <i>Acetabularia
    miocenica</i> from the Crimea. It occurs in Miocene rocks south of
    Sevastopol, and, with <i>Ostrea</i> and <i>Pecten</i>, forms masses of
    white limestone.</p>

  <p>In each sporangial ray of the disc the cavity contains a calcareous
    spicula bearing spore cavities in four rows. “Round each spore-cavity
    there is a circular zone which stands out, when viewed in reflected
    light, through its white colour against the central mass of the
    spicule, though a sharp contour is not visible<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>.” Fig. 33, C, is
    taken from a somewhat diagrammatic sketch by Andrussow; it shows ten of
    the fertile rays of the disc. The thick walls of the chambers are seen
    in the two lowest rays, and in the next two rays the spore-cavities
    are represented. A more accurate drawing, from Solms-Laubach’s
    memoir, is reproduced in fig. 33, D. The calcareous spicule with
    numerous spore-cavities shown in fig. 33, H, is from a fertile ray
    of the recent species <i>Acicularia Schencki</i>. This corresponds
    to the spore-containing calcareous matrix in each ray of the disc of
    <i>Acicularia Andrussowi</i> Solms. The spicule copied in fig. 33, F
    from one of Carpenter’s drawings<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> of an <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>Eocene specimen bears the

    district, from the Leithakalk of Moravia and elsewhere. It agrees very
    closely with the recent species <i>A. Schencki</i>. A section of
    one of the spicules of this species is shown in fig. 33, E; the dark
    patches represent the pockets in the calcareous spicule which were
    originally occupied by sporangia and spores.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Cymopolia"><i>Cymopolia</i>. Fig. 33, A, B, M and N.</div>

  <p>The genus <i>Cymopolia</i> is at present represented by two species,
    <i>C. barbata</i> (L.) and <i>C. mexicana</i>, Ag., living in the Gulf
    of Mexico and off the Canary Islands.</p>

  <p><i>Cymopolia</i> and <i>Acetabularia</i>, with several other calcareous
    algae, are figured by Ellis and other writers as members of the animal
    kingdom. Ellis speaks of the species of <i>Cymopolia</i> which he
    figures as the Rosary Bead-Coralline of Jamaica.</p>

  <p>Fig. 33, M, has been drawn from a figure published by Ellis in his
    <i>Natural History of the Corallines</i> published in 1755<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>. The
    thallus has the form of a repeatedly forked body, of which the branches
    are divided into cylindrical joints thickly encrusted with carbonate of
    lime, but constricted and uncalcified at the limits of each segment. A
    tuft of hairs is given off from the terminal segment of each branch.
    The axis of each branch of the thallus is occupied by a cylindrical
    and unseptate cell which gives off crowded whorls of lateral branches.
    In the lower part of fig. 33, M, the calcareous investment has been
    removed, and the branches are seen as fine hair-like appendages of the
    central cell. The branches given off from the constricted portions of
    the axis are unbranched simple appendages, but the others terminate in
    bladder-like swellings, each of which bears an apical sporangium. The
    sporangia are surrounded and enclosed by the swollen tips of four to
    six branches which spring from the summit of the sporangial branch.
    Fig. 33, A, represents part <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>of a transverse section through the
    calcareous outer portion of a branch of <i>Cymopolia</i>; the darker
    portions or cavities in the calcareous matrix were originally occupied
    by the lateral branches and sporangia<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>.</p>

  <p>In Fig. 33, B, the sporangial branch with the terminal sporangium and
    three of the investing branches are more clearly shown, the surrounding
    calcareous investment and the thallus having been removed by the action
    of an acid.</p>

  <p>In a transverse section of a branch from which the organic matter
    had been removed, and only the calcareous matrix left, one would
    see a central circular cavity surrounded by a thick calcareous wall
    perforated by radially disposed canals and containing globular
    cavities; the canals and cavities being occupied in the living plant by
    branches and sporangia respectively.</p>

  <p>The two circular cavities shown in the figure mark the position of the
    sporangia which are borne on branches with somewhat swollen tips. From
    the summit the left-hand sporangial branch shown in fig. 33, A, three
    of the secondary branches are represented by channels in the calcareous
    matrix; the two black dots on the face of the sporangiophore being the
    scars of the remaining two secondary branches.</p>

  <p>By the lateral contact of the swollen ends of the ultimate branches
    enclosing the sporangia the whole surface of the thallus, when examined
    with a lens, presents a pitted appearance. Each pit or circular
    depression (fig. 33, N) marks the position of the swollen tip of a
    branch.</p>

  <p>This form of thallus represents a type which is met with in several
    members of the Dasycladaceae. It would carry us beyond the limits
    of a short account to describe additional recent genera which throw
    light on the numerous fossil species. For further information as to
    the recent members of the family, the student should refer to Murray’s
    <i>Seaweeds</i><a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>, and for a more detailed memoir on the group

  <div class="sidenote">PALAEOZOIC SIPHONEAE.</div>

  <p>The publication of a short preliminary note by Prof. Munier-Chalmas in
    the <i>Comptes Rendus</i> for 1877 was the means of calling attention
    to the exceptional importance of the calcareous Siphoneae as algae
    possessing an interesting past history, of which satisfactory records
    had been preserved in rocks of various ages. Decaisne had pointed
    out in 1842 that certain marine organisms previously regarded as
    animals should be transferred to the plant kingdom. Such seaweeds as
    <i>Halimeda</i>, <i>Udotea</i>, <i>Penicillus</i> and others were thus
    assigned to their correct position. Many fossil algae belonging to this
    group continued to be dealt with as Foraminifera until Munier-Chalmas
    demonstrated their true affinities. In Gümbel’s monograph on the
    so-called Nullipores found in limestone rocks, published in 1871<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>,
    several examples of siphoneous algae are included among the fossil
    Protozoa.</p>

  <p>In recent years there have been several additions to an already
    long list of fossil Siphoneae. In addition to the numerous and
    well-preserved specimens, representing a large number of generic and
    specific forms, which have been collected from the Eocene of the Paris
    basin, there is plenty of evidence of the abundance of the members of
    the Dasycladaceae in the Triassic seas. In the Triassic limestones
    of the Tyrol, as well as in other regions, the calcareous bodies of
    siphoneous algae have played no inconsiderable part as agents of
    rock-building<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>. Genera have been recorded from Silurian and other
    Palaeozoic horizons, and there is no doubt that the Verticillate
    Siphoneae of to-day are the remnants of an extremely ancient family,
    which in former periods was represented by a much more widely
    distributed and more varied assemblage of species. There is probably
    no more promising field of work in the domain of fossil algae than the
    further investigation of the numerous forms included in Munier-Chalmas’
    class of Siphoneae <span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>Verticillatae. A brief description of a few genera
    from different geological horizons must suffice to draw attention to
    the character of the data for a phylogenetic history of this group.</p>

  <p>The fossil examples of the genus <i>Cymopolia</i> (<i>Polytrypa</i>)
    were originally described by Defrance<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> in the <i>Dictionnaire
    des Sciences Naturelles</i> as small polyps under the generic name
    <i>Polytrypa</i>.</p>

  <p>In the Eocene sands of the Paris basin there have been found numerous
    specimens of short, calcareous tubes which Munier-Chalmas has shewn
    are no doubt the isolated segments of an alga practically identical
    with the recent <i>Cymopolia</i>. A section<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> through one of the
    fossil segments presents precisely the same features as those which are
    represented in fig. 33, A. The habit of the Eocene alga and its minute
    structure were apparently almost identical with those of the recent
    species, <i>Cymopolia barbata</i>. The two drawings of <i>Cymopolia</i>
    reproduced in fig. 33, A and B, have been copied from Munier-Chalmas’
    note in the <i>Comptes Rendus</i><a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>; the corresponding figures given
    by this author of the Eocene species (<i>Cymopolia elongata</i> Deb.)
    are practically identical with figs. A and B, and show no points of
    real difference. The segments of the thallus of the fossil species,
    as figured by Defrance<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>, appear to be rather longer than those of
    the recent species. The calcareous investment of the axial cell of the
    thallus was traversed by regular verticils of branches or ‘leaves’; the
    central branch of each whorl terminates in an oval sporangial cavity,
    exactly as in fig. 33, A and B; and from the top of this branch there
    is given off a ring of slender prolongations which terminate on the
    surface of the calcareous tube as regularly disposed depressions, which
    were no doubt originally occupied by their swollen distal ends as in
    the recent species.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Vermiporella"><i>Vermiporella.</i></div>

  <p>This generic name was proposed by Stolley for certain branched and
    curved tubes found in Silurian boulders from the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>North German
    drift<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>. The tubes have a diameter of ·5–1 mm., and are perforated
    by radial canals which probably mark the position of verticils of
    branches given off at right angles to the central axis. The surface of
    the tubes is divided into regular hexagonal areas.</p>

  <p>The resemblance of these Silurian fossils to <i>Diplopora</i> and other
    genera favours their inclusion in the Verticillate Siphoneae.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Sycidium"><i>Sycidium.</i> Fig. 32, B.</div>

  <p>The fossils included in this genus were first described by Sandberger
    from the middle Devonian rocks of the Eifel, and referred by him to the
    animal kingdom. More recently Deecke has suggested the removal of the
    genus to the calcareous Siphoneae, and such a view appears perfectly
    reasonable, although without more data it is not possible to speak with
    absolute certainty.</p>

  <p><i>Sycidium melo.</i> (Sandb.) Fig. 32, <i>B.</i> The specimen
    represented in fig. 32, B (i), (ii), drawn from Deecke’s figures<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>,
    has the form of a small oval calcareous body, 1 mm. in transverse
    diameter and 1–1·3 mm. in longitudinal diameter. It is pointed at one
    end and flattened at the other. At the flatter end there is a circular
    depression, continued into a funnel-shaped cavity, and on the walls of
    this cavity there are 18–20 radially disposed ribs, which extend over
    the surface of the whole body. A series of transverse ribs intersects
    the vertical ribs at right angles. The calcareous wall is perforated by
    numerous whorls of circular pores, and the internal cavity is a simple
    undivided space. Each of these oval bodies (fig. 33, B) is probably the
    segment of a thallus, and the perforations in the wall may have been
    originally occupied by lateral prolongations from the unseptate axial
    cell of the thallus. <i>Sycidium</i> bears a fairly close resemblance
    to the Tertiary <i>Ovulites</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

  <div class="h7" id="Diplopora"><i>Diplopora.</i> Fig. 35, A and B.</div>

  <p>This genus of algae is characteristic of Triassic rocks, and is
    especially abundant in Muschelkalk and Lower Keuper limestones of the
    Alps, Silesia, and elsewhere. The thallus, or rather the calcareous
    portion of the thallus, has the form of a thick-walled tube, with a
    diameter of about 4 mm., and occasionally reaching a length of 50 mm.
    At one end the tube has a rounded and closed termination, and the
    wall is pierced throughout its whole length by regular whorls of fine
    canals. <i>Diplopora</i> agrees with <i>Cymopolia</i> in its main
    features.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Fig. 35, A, affords a diagrammatic view of a <i>Diplopora</i> tube,
    and shews the arrangement of the numerous whorls of canals. In
    fig. 35, B, a piece of limestone is represented containing several
    Diploporas cut across transversely and more or less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span> obliquely. In
    an obliquely transverse section of a tube perforated by horizontal
    canals the cavities of the canals necessarily appear as holes or
    discontinuous canals in the substance of the calcareous wall. The
    manner of occurrence of the specimens points to the abundance of this
    genus in the Triassic seas, and suggests that the calcareous tubes of
    <i>Diplopora</i> may have been important factors in the building up
    of limestone sediments<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>. In many instances no doubt the carbonate
    of lime of the thallus has been dissolved and recrystallised, and the
    original form completely obliterated. As in the rocks built up largely
    of calcareous Florideae (p. 185) which have lost their structure, it
    is a legitimate inference that some of the limestone rocks which shew
    no trace of organic structure may have been in part derived from the
    calcareous incrustation of various algal genera.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Gyroporella"><i>Gyroporella.</i> Fig. 35, C and D.</div>

  <p>In this genus from the Alpine Trias the structure of the calcareous
    tube is very similar to that in <i>Diplopora</i>, but in
    <i>Gyroporella</i> the canals form less distinct whorls and are closed
    externally by a small plate, as seen in figs. 35, C and D.</p>

  <p>As Solms-Laubach has pointed out, the branch-systems of
    <i>Diplopora</i>, <i>Gyroporella</i> and other older genera are much
    simpler than in the Tertiary genera <i>Dactylopora</i> and others<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>.</p>

  <p>A species of <i>Gyroporella</i>, <i>G. bellerophontis</i>, has recently
    been described by Rothpletz<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> from Permian rocks in the Southern
    Tyrol. The thallus is tubular in form and has a diameter of ·5–1 mm.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Dactylopora"><i>Dactylopora.</i></div>

  <p>The genus <i>Dactylopora</i> was founded by Lamarck<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> on some fossil
    specimens from the Calcaire Grossier and included among the Zoophytes.
    D’Orbigny afterwards included it among the Foraminifera, and the
    structure of the calcareous body has been described by Carpenter<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
    and other writers on the Foraminifera. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>In a specimen of <i>Dactylopora
    cylindracea</i> Lam. from the Paris basin, for which I am indebted to
    Munier-Chalmas, the tubular thallus measures 4 mm. in diameter; at
    the complete end it is closed and bluntly rounded. The wall of the
    tube is perforated by numerous canals, and contains oval cavities
    which were no doubt originally occupied by sporangia. The shape of
    the specimens is similar to that of <i>Diplopora</i>, but the canals
    and cavities present a characteristic and more complex appearance,
    when seen in a transverse section of the wall, than in the older genus
    <i>Diplopora</i>. Gümbel has given a detailed account of this Tertiary
    genus in his memoir on <cite>Die sogenannten Nulliporen</cite><a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>; he
    distinguishes between <i>Dactyloporella</i> and <i>Gyroporella</i> by
    the existence of cavities in the calcareous wall of the tube in the
    former genus, and by their absence in the latter. The oval cavities
    in a <i>Dactyloporella</i> were originally occupied by sporangia; in
    <i>Diplopora</i> and <i>Gyroporella</i> the sporangia were probably
    borne externally and on an uncalcified portion of the thallus.</p>

  <p>In addition to the few examples of fossil species described above there
    are numerous others of considerable interest, which illustrate the
    great wealth of form among the Tertiary and other representatives of
    the Verticillate Siphoneae.</p>

  <p>Reference has already been made to <i>Vermiporella</i> as an example
    of a Silurian genus. Other genera have been described by Stolley
    from Silurian boulders in the North-German drift under the names
    <i>Palaeoporella</i>, <i>Dasyporella</i> and <i>Rhabdoporella</i><a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>;
    the latter genus is compared with the Triassic <i>Diplopora</i>, and
    the two preceding with the recent <i>Bornetella</i>.</p>

  <p>Schlüter has transferred a supposed Devonian Foraminiferal genus,
    <i>Coelotrochium</i><a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>, to the list of Palaeozoic Siphoneae.
    Munier-Chalmas regards some of the fossils described by Saporta under
    the name of <i>Goniolina</i><a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>, and classed among the inflorescences
    of pro-angiospermous plants, as examples of Jurassic Siphoneae. The
    shape and surface-features of some of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>examples of <i>Goniolina</i>
    suggest a comparison with Echinoid spines, but the resemblance
    which many of the forms in the Sorbonne collection present to large
    calcareous Siphoneae is still more striking. A comparison of Saporta’s
    fig. 5, Pl. xxxiii. and fig. 4, Pl. xxxii. in volume iv. of the
    <cite>Flore Jurassique</cite>, with the figures given by Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
    and Cramer<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> of species of <i>Bornetella</i> brings out a close
    similarity between <i>Goniolina</i> and recent algae; the chief
    difference being the greater size of the fossil forms. The possibility
    of confounding Echinoid spines with calcareous Siphoneae is illustrated
    by Rothpletz<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>, who has expressed the opinion that Gümbel’s
    <i>Haploporella fasciculata</i> is not an alga but the spine of a
    sea-urchin.</p>

  <p>Among Cretaceous forms, in addition to <i>Goniolina</i>, which passes
    upwards from Jurassic rocks, <i>Triploporella</i><a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> and other genera
    have been recorded.</p>

  <p><i>Uteria</i><a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> is an interesting type of Tertiary genera; it occurs
    in the form of barrel-shaped rings, which are probably the detached
    segments of a form in which the central axial cell was encrusted
    with carbonate of lime, but the sporangia and the whorls of branches
    differed from those of <i>Cymopolia</i> in being without a calcareous
    investment.</p>

  <h5 id="Confervoideae"><i>b.</i> <span class="smcap">Confervoideae.</span></h5>

  <p>Without attempting to describe at length the fossil forms referred to
    this division of the Chlorophyceae, there is one fossil which deserves
    a passing notice. Brongniart in 1828<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> instituted the generic term
    <i>Confervites</i> for filamentous fossils resembling recent species
    of confervoid algae. Numerous fossils have been referred to this
    genus by different authors, but they are for the most part valueless
    and need not be further considered. In 1887 Bornemann described
    some new forms which he referred to this genus from the Cambrian
    rocks of Sardinia. He describes the red marble of San Pietra, near
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>Masne, as being in places full of the delicate remains of algae
    having the form of branched filaments, and appearing in sections of
    the rock as white lines on a dark crystalline matrix. In fig. 35, G,
    one of these Sardinian specimens is represented. This form is named
    <i>Confervites Chantransioides</i><a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>; the thallus consists of
    branched cell-filaments, having a breadth of 6–7µ, and composed of
    ovate cells. It is possible that this is a fragment of a Cambrian
    alga, but the figures and descriptions do not afford by any means
    convincing evidence. From post-Tertiary beds various genera, such as
    <i>Vaucheria</i> and others, have been recorded, but they possess but
    little botanical value.</p>

  <div class="center"><i>Fossils in Boghead ‘Coal’ referred by some authors to the
    Chlorophyceae.</i></div>

  <p>During the last few years much has been written by two French authors,
    Dr Renault and Prof. Bertrand, on the subject of the so-called Boghead
    of France, Scotland, and other countries. They hold the view that the
    formation of the extensive beds of this carbonaceous material was due
    to the accumulation and preservation of enormous numbers of minute
    algae which lived in Permo-Carboniferous lakes.</p>

  <p>In an article contributed to <cite>Science-Progress</cite> in 1895 I ventured
    to express doubts as to the correctness of the conclusions of MM.
    Renault and Bertrand<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>. Since then Prof. Bertrand has very kindly
    demonstrated to me many of his microscopic preparations of various
    Bogheads, and I am indebted to Prof. Bayley Balfour of Edinburgh for an
    opportunity of examining a series of sections of the Scotch Boghead.
    The examination of these specimens has convinced me of the difficulties
    of the problems which many investigators have tried to solve, but it
    has by no means led me to entirely adopt the views expressed by MM.
    Bertrand and Renault.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">BOGHEAD.</div>

  <p>The Boghead or Torbanite of Scotland was rendered famous by a
    protracted lawsuit tried in Edinburgh from July 29th to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>August 4th,
    1853. A lease had been granted by Mr and Mrs Gillespie, of Torbanehill,
    in Fifeshire, to Messrs James Russell and Son, coal-masters of
    Falkirk, of “the whole <em>coal</em>, ironstone, iron-ore, limestone,
    and fire-clay (but not to comprehend copper, or any other minerals
    whatsoever, except those specified) with lands of Torbanehill<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>.”
    After the Boghead had been worked for two years the Gillespies
    challenged the right of Messrs Russell, and argued that the valuable
    <em>mineral</em> Torbanite was not included among the substances named
    in the agreement. The defendants maintained that it was a <em>coal</em>,
    known as gas-, cannel- or parrot-coal. A verdict was given for the
    defendants. Some of the scientific experts who gave evidence at the
    trial considered that the Boghead afforded indications of organic
    structure, while others regarded it as essentially mineral in origin.</p>

  <p>The Torbanite or Boghead is a close-grained brown rock, of peculiar
    toughness and having a subconchoidal fracture. It contains about 65%
    carbon, with some hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur, and mineral substances. A
    thin section examined under the microscope presents the appearance of
    a dark and amorphous matrix, containing numerous oval, spherical and
    irregularly shaped bright orange-yellow patches. Fig. 36, 1 shows the
    manner of occurrence of the yellow bodies in a piece of Scotch Boghead,
    as seen in a slightly magnified horizontal section. Under a higher
    power the light patches in the figure reveal traces of a faint radial
    striation, which in some cases suggests the occurrence of a number of
    oval or polygonal cells.</p>

  <p>The Autun Boghead possesses practically the same structure. The yellow
    bodies are often sufficiently abundant to impart a bright yellow colour
    to a thin section. If the section is vertical the coloured bodies are
    seen to be arranged in more or less regular layers parallel to the
    plane of bedding.</p>

  <p>The Kerosene shale of New South Wales agrees closely with the Scotch
    and French Boghead; it is approximately of the same geological age, and
    is largely made up of orange or yellow bodies similar to those of the
    European Boghead, but much more clearly preserved.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

  <p>The nature and manner of formation of the various forms of coal should
    be dealt with in a later chapter devoted to the subject of plants as
    rock-builders, but in view of the recent statements as to the algal
    nature of these bituminous deposits it may not be out of place to state
    briefly the main conclusions of the French authors.</p>

  <p>MM. Renault and Bertrand regard each of the yellow bodies in the
    European and Australian Boghead as the thallus of an alga. To the
    form which is most abundant in the Kerosene shale they have given the
    generic name of <i>Reinschia</i>, while that in the Scotch and French
    Boghead is named <i>Pila</i>.</p>

  <h5 id="Reinschia"><i>Reinschia.</i> Fig. 36, 3.</h5>

  <p>A section of a piece of Kerosene shale at right angles to the bedding
    appears to be made up of fairly regular layers of flattened elliptical
    sacs of an orange or yellow colour. Each sac or thallus is about
    300µ in length and 150µ broad (fig. 36, 3). A single row of cells
    constitutes the wall surrounding the central globular cavity. The cells
    are more or less pyriform in shape, and the cell-cavities are filled
    with a dark substance, described by Renault and Bertrand as protoplasm,
    and the cell-walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> are fairly thick. In some of the larger specimens
    there are often found a few smaller sacs enclosed in the cavity of
    the partially disorganised mother-thallus. In the larger specimens
    the wall is usually invaginated in several places, giving the whole
    thallus a lobed or brain-like appearance. The supposed alga, which
    makes up ⁹⁄₁₀ths of the contents of a block of Kerosene shale, is
    named <i>Reinschia Australis</i>; it is regarded by the authors of the
    species as nearly related to the Hydrodictyaceae or Volvocineae.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In the Kerosene shale from certain localities in New South Wales
    Bertrand recognises a second form of thallus, which he refers to the
    genus <i>Pila</i>, characteristic of the European Bogheads.</p>

  <h5 id="Pila"><i>Pila</i>. Fig. 36, 2.</h5>

  <p>The “thallus” characteristic of the Scotch Boghead has been named
    <i>Pila scotica</i>, and that of the Autun Boghead, <i>Pila
    bibractensis</i>.</p>

  <p>In the latter form, which has been studied in more detail by MM.
    Renault and Bertrand, the thallus consists of about 6–700 cells, and
    is irregularly ellipsoidal in form, from ·189–·225mm. in length,
    and ·136–·160mm. broad. The surface-cells are radially disposed and
    pyramidal in shape, the internal cells are polygonal in outline and
    less regularly arranged (fig. 36, 2). The Pila thalli make up ¾ths of
    the mass in an average sample of the Autun Boghead. The Autun Boghead
    often contains siliceous nodules, and sections of these occasionally
    include cells of a <i>Pila</i> in which the protoplasmic contents
    and nuclei have been described by the French authors. The evidence
    for the existence of these supposed nuclei is, however, not entirely
    satisfactory; sections of silicified thalli which were shown to me by
    Prof. Bertrand did not satisfy me as to the minute histological details
    recognised by Bertrand and Renault.</p>

  <p>The species of <i>Pila</i> are compared with the recent genus
    <i>Celastrum</i>, and regarded as most nearly allied to the
    Chroococcaceae or Pleurococcaceae among recent algae. Prof. Bornet<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
    has suggested <i>Gomphosphaeria</i> as a genus which presents a
    resemblance to the Autun <i>Pila</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

  <p>In addition to the Bogheads of Autun, Torbanehill, and New South Wales,
    there are similar Palaeozoic deposits in Russia, America, and various
    other parts of the world. Full details of the structure of Boghead and
    the supposed algae referred to <i>Reinschia</i>, <i>Pila</i>, and other
    genera will be found in the writings of Bertrand and Renault<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>.</p>

  <p>The Kerosene shale of New South Wales affords the most striking and
    well-preserved examples of the cellular orange and yellow bodies
    referred to as the globular thalli of algae. It is almost impossible to
    conceive a purely inorganic material assuming such forms as those which
    occur in the Australian Boghead. On the other hand, it is hardly less
    easy to understand the possibility of such explanations as have been
    suggested of the organic origin of these characteristic bodies.</p>

  <p>The ground-mass or matrix of the Boghead is referred to a brown ulmic
    precipitate thrown down on the floor of a Permian or Carboniferous
    lake, probably under the action of calcareous water. In this material
    there accumulated countless thalli of minute gelatinous algae, which
    probably at certain seasons completely covered the surface of the
    waters, as the <i lang="fr">fleurs d’eau</i> in many of our fresh-water lakes. In
    addition to the thalli of <i>Reinschia</i> and <i>Pila</i> the Bogheads
    contain a few remains of various plant fragments, pollen-grains,
    and pieces of wood. Fish-scales and the coprolites of reptiles and
    fishes occur in some of the beds. On a piece of Kerosene shale in
    the Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge, there are two well-preserved
    graphitic impressions of the tongue-shaped fronds of <i>Glossopteris
    Browniana</i>, Brongn. There can be little doubt that the beds of
    Boghead were deposited under water as members of a regular sequence of
    sedimentary strata. The yellow bodies which form so great a part of
    the beds are practically all of the same type. <i>Reinschia</i> and
    <i>Pila</i> cannot always be distinguished, and it would seem that
    there are no adequate grounds for instituting two distinct genera and
    referring them to different families of recent algae.</p>

  <p>Stated briefly, my conclusion is that the algae of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>French
    authors may be definite organic bodies, but it is unwise to attempt
    to determine their affinities within such narrow limits as have been
    referred to in the above <i lang="fr">résumé</i>. The structure of the bituminous
    deposits is worthy of careful study, and it is by no means impossible
    that further research might lead us to accept the view of the earlier
    investigators, that the brightly coloured organic-like bodies may be
    inorganic in origin.</p>

  <h4 id="RHODOPHYCEAE">C. RHODOPHYCEAE. (<span class="smcap">Florideae. Red Algae.</span>)</h4>

  <p>The thallus of the members of this group assumes various forms,
    and consists of branched cell-filaments of a more or less
    complex structure. Cells of the thallus contain a red colouring
    matter in addition to the green chlorophyll. The reproduction is
    asexual and sexual; the formation of asexual reproductive cells
    (<em>tetraspores</em>) in groups of four in sporangia is a characteristic
    method of reproduction. Sexual reproduction is effected by means of
    distinct male and female cells.</p>

  <p>With the exception of a few fresh-water genera all the red algae are
    marine. The Rhodophyceae, like the Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae,
    include a shell-boring form which has been found in the common
    razor-shell<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>. Several genera live as endophytes in the tissues
    of other algae. The recent species of this section of algae are
    characteristic of temperate and tropical seas. One subdivision of the
    red algae, the Corallinaceae, is extremely important from a geological
    point of view and must be dealt with in some detail.</p>

  <h5 id="Corallinaceae"><span class="smcap">Corallinaceae.</span></h5>

  <p>The thallus is usually encrusted with carbonate of lime; it is
    of a branched cylindrical form in the well-known <i>Corallina
    officinalis</i>, Linn. of the British coasts, of an encrusting and
    foliaceous type, in the genus <i>Lithophyllum</i>, and of a more
    coral-like form in the genus <i>Lithothamnion</i>. The reproductive
    organs occur in conceptacles, having the form of small depressed
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>cavities in the thallus, or projecting as warty swellings above the
    surface of the plant. Asexual reproduction is by means of tetraspores
    formed in conceptacles resembling those containing the sexual cells.
    The Corallinaceae may be subdivided into the two families Melobesieae
    and Corallineae<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Corallina</i> is the best known British representative
    of the Corallinaceae. With other members of the group it was long
    regarded as a coralline animal, and it is only comparatively recently
    that the plant-nature of these forms has been generally admitted.
    <i>Lithophyllum</i>, <i>Lithothamnion</i>, <i>Melobesia</i>, and other
    genera of the Corallinaceae and some of the Siphoneae play a very
    important part in the building and cementing of coral-reefs. The pink
    or rose-coloured calcareous thallus of some of these calcareous algae
    or Nullipores imparts to coral-reefs a characteristic appearance.
    In some cases, indeed, the coral-reefs are very largely composed
    of algae. Saville Kent<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> describes the Corallines or Nullipores
    of the Australian Barrier-reef as furnishing a considerable quota
    towards the composition of the coral rock. Mr Stanley Gardiner, who
    accompanied the coral-boring expedition to the island of Funafuti, has
    kindly allowed me to quote the following extract from his notes, which
    affords an interesting example of the importance of calcareous algae as
    reef-building organisms. “It is quite a misnomer to speak of the outer
    edge of a reef like this (Rotuma Island) as being formed of coral. It
    would be far better to call it a Nullipore reef, as it is completely
    encrusted by these algae, while outside in the perfectly clear water,
    10 to 15 fathoms in depth, the bottom has a most brilliant appearance
    from masses of red, white and pink Nullipores, with only a stray coral
    here and there.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

  <p>Agassiz<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> has given an account of the occurrence of immense masses
    of Nullipores (<i>Udotea</i>, <i>Halimeda</i> etc.) in the Florida
    reefs; his description is illustrated by good figures of these algae.</p>

  <p>In the Mediterranean there are true Nullipore reefs, which are
    interesting geologically as well as botanically. Walther<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> has
    described one of these limestone-banks in the Gulf of Naples which
    occurs about 1 kilometre from the coast and 30 metres below the
    surface of the water. Every dredging, he says, brings up numberless
    masses of <i>Lithothamnion fasciculatum</i> (Lamarck), and <i>L.
    crassum</i> (Phil.). Between the branches of the algae, gasteropods
    and other animals become completely enclosed by the growing plants,
    while diatoms, foraminifera, and other forms of life are abundant.
    Water percolating through the mass gradually destroys the structure of
    the algal thalli, and in places reduces the whole bank to a compact
    structureless limestone.</p>

  <p>The same author<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> has also called attention to the importance of
    <i>Lithophyllum</i> as a constructive element in the coral-reefs off
    the Sinai peninsula.</p>

  <p><i>Lithothamnion</i> a typical genus of the Corallinaceae may be
    briefly described.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Lithothamnion"><i>Lithothamnion.</i> Fig. 37.</div>

  <p>Philippi<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> was the first writer to describe this and other genera as
    plants. He gave the following definition of <i>Lithothamnion</i>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Stirps calcarea rigida, e ramis cylindricis vel compressiusculis
      dichotoma ramosis constans.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The thallus of <i>Lithothamnion</i> grows attached to the face of
    a rock or other foundation, and forms a hard, stony mass, assuming
    various coralline shapes. The exposed face may have the form of
    numerous short branches or of an irregular warty surface.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

  <p>In section (fig. 37, A.) the lower part of the thallus is seen to
    be made up of rows of cells radiating out from a central point, and
    the upper portion consists of vertical and horizontal rows of cells.
    The whole body is divided up into a large number of small cells by
    anticlinal and periclinal walls, and possesses an evident cellular as
    distinct from a tubular structure. Conceptacles containing reproductive
    organs are either sunk in the thallus or project above the surface. The
    two types of structure in a single thallus are shown in fig. 37, A,
    also a conceptacle containing tetraspores.</p>

  <p>In the closely allied <i>Lithophyllum</i> the thallus is encrusting,
    and in section it presents the same appearance as the lower part of a
    Lithothamnion thallus.</p>

  <p>Species of <i>Lithothamnion</i> occur in the Mediterranean Sea, and are
    abundant in the arctic regions<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>, while on the British coasts the
    genus is represented by four species<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>. Some large <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>specimens of
    <i>Lithothamnion</i> and <i>Lithophyllum</i> are exhibited in one of
    the show-cases in the botanical department of the British Museum. For
    the best figures and descriptions of recent species reference should
    be made to the works of Hauck, Rosanoff, Rosenvinge, Kjellman and
    Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>.</p>

  <p>It is to be expected that such calcareous algae as <i>Lithothamnion</i>
    should be widely represented by fossil forms. In addition to the
    botanical importance of the data furnished by the fossil species as
    to the past history of the Corallinaceae, there is much of geological
    interest to be learnt from a study of the manner of occurrence of both
    the fossil and recent representatives. As agents of rock-building the
    coralline algae are especially important. The late Prof. Unger<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> in
    1858 gave an account of the so-called Leithakalk of the Tertiary Vienna
    basin, and recognised the importance of fossil algae as rock-forming
    organisms. The Miocene Leithakalk, which is widely used in Vienna as a
    building stone<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>, consists in part of limestone rocks consisting to
    a large extent of <i>Lithothamnion</i>.</p>

  <p>Since the publication of Unger’s work several writers have described
    numerous fossil species of <i>Lithothamnion</i> from various geological
    horizons. A few examples will suffice to illustrate the range and
    structure of this and other genera of the Corallinaceae. In dealing
    with the fossil species it is often impossible to make use of those
    characters which are of primary importance in the recognition of recent
    species. The fossil thallus is usually too intimately associated with
    the surrounding rock to admit of any use being made of external form
    as a diagnostic feature. The size and form of the cells must be taken
    as the chief basis on which to determine specific differences. In
    the absence of conceptacles or reproductive organs it is not always
    easy to distinguish calcareous algae from fossil Hydrozoa or Bryozoa.
    In many instances, however, apart from the nature and size of the
    elements composing the thallus, the conceptacles afford a valuable
    aid to identification. An example <span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>of a fossil conceptacle containing
    tetraspores is shown in fig. 37, C; it is from a Tertiary species of
    <i>Lithothamnion</i>, described by Früh from Montévraz in Switzerland.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Lithothamnion mamillosum</i> Gümb. Fig. 32, A (i) and (ii).
    (p. 155.) This species was first recorded by Gümbel<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> from the
    Upper Cretaceous (Danian) rocks of Petersbergs, near Maëstricht, on
    the Belgian frontier. It was originally described as a Bryozoan. The
    thallus has the form of an encrusting calcareous structure bearing
    on its upper surface thick nodular branches, as shown in fig. 32, A
    (ii); in section, A (i), the thallus consists of a regular series of
    rectangular cells.</p>

  <p>The specific name <i>mamillosum</i> has also been given to a recent
    species by Hauck<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>, but probably in ignorance of the existence of
    Gümbel’s Cretaceous species.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Lithothamnion suganum</i> Roth. Fig. 37, B. The section of
    this form given in fig. 37, B shows three oval conceptacles filled
    with crystalline material. The two lower conceptacles originally
    communicated with the surface of the thallus, but as in recent species
    the deeper portions of the algal body became covered over by additions
    to the surface, forming merely dead foundations for new and overlying
    living tissues.</p>

  <p>The cells of the thallus have a breadth of 7–9µ, and a length of 9–12µ.</p>

  <p>The specimen was obtained from a Lithothamnion bank, probably of Upper
    Oligocene age, in Val Sugana<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>, in the Austrian Tyrol.</p>

  <p>Numerous other species of Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary age
    might be quoted, but the above may suffice to illustrate the general
    characters and mode of occurrence of the genus. It is important that
    the student should become familiar with the <i>Lithothamnion</i>
    and <i>Lithophyllum</i> types of thallus, in view of their frequent
    occurrence in crystalline limestone rocks and in such comparatively
    recent deposits as those of upraised coral-reefs. The coral-rock of
    Barbados and other West-Indian islands <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>affords a good illustration of
    the manner of occurrence of fossil coralline algae in association with
    corals and other organisms<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>.</p>

  <p>In the fossil species of <i>Lithothamnion</i> hitherto recorded there
    do not appear to be any important features in which they differ from
    recent forms; the geological history of the genus so far as it is
    known, favours the view that the generic characters are of considerable
    antiquity.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Solenopora"><i>Solenopora.</i> Fig. 38.</div>

  <p>Mr A. Brown<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>, of Aberdeen, has recently brought forward good
    evidence for including various calcareous fossils, described by several
    authors under different names and referred to various genera of fossil
    animals, in the genus <i>Solenopora</i>, which he places among the
    coralline algae.</p>

  <p>Species of this genus have been described from England, Scotland,
    Esthonia, Russia, and other countries. The geological range of
    <i>Solenopora</i> appears to be from Ordovician to Jurassic rocks; in
    some cases it is an important constituent of beds of limestone.</p>

  <p><i>Solenopora compacta</i> (Billings). Fig. 38. This species was
    originally described by Billings as <i>Stromatopora compacta</i>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>and afterwards defined by Nicholson and Etheridge. The thallus forms
    sub-spheroidal masses, from the size of a hemp-seed to that of an
    orange. The external surface is lobulate; the fractured surface has
    a porcellaneous and sometimes a fibrous appearance, and is usually
    white or light brown in colour. In vertical section (fig. 38, B) the
    cells are elongated and arranged in a radiating and parallel fashion;
    they often occur in concentric layers. The cells have a diameter of
    about ¹⁄₁₇ mm. and possess distinctly undulating walls, as seen in a
    tangential section (fig. 38, A). Brown describes certain larger cells
    in the thallus (fig. 38, A) as sporangia<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>, but it is difficult to
    recognise any distinct sporangial cavities in the drawing. The example
    figured is from the Trenton limestone of Canada; a variety of the
    same species has been recorded from the Ordovician rocks of Girvan
    in Ayrshire. There appear to be good reasons for accepting Brown’s
    conclusion that <i>Solenopora</i> belongs to the Corallinaceae rather
    than to the Hydrozoa, among which it was originally included. After
    comparing <i>Solenopora</i> with recent genera of Florideae, Brown
    concludes that “the forms of the cells and cell-walls, the method
    of increase, and the arrangement of the tissue cells in the various
    species of <i>Solenopora</i> bear strong evidence of relationship
    between that genus and the calcareous algae<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>.”</p>

  <p>The importance of the calcareous Rhodophyceae has been frequently
    emphasised by recent researches, and our knowledge of the rock-building
    forms is already fairly extensive. We possess evidence of the existence
    of species of different genera in Ordovician seas, as well as in those
    of the Silurian, Triassic, Jurassic, and more recent periods. It is
    reasonable to prophesy that further researches into the structure
    of ancient limestones will considerably extend our knowledge of the
    geological and botanical history of the Corallinaceae.</p>

  <p>Numerous fossils have been described as examples of other genera<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
    of Rhodophyceae than those included in the Corallinaceae, but these
    possess little or no scientific value and need not be considered.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>
  <h4 id="PHAEOPHYCEAE">D. PHAEOPHYCEAE (<span class="smcap">Brown Algae</span>).</h4>

  <p>Olive-brown algae, thallus often leathery in texture, composed of
    cell-filaments or parenchymatous tissue, in some cases exhibiting
    a considerable degree of internal differentiation. The sexual
    reproductive organs may be either in the form of passive egg-cells
    and motile antherozoids or of motile cells showing no external sexual
    difference.</p>

  <p>With one or two exceptions all the genera are marine. They have a wide
    distribution at the present day, and are especially characteristic
    of far northern and extreme southern latitudes. The gigantic forms
    <i>Lessonia</i>, <i>Macrocystis</i> and others already alluded to,
    belong to this group; also the genus <i>Sargassum</i>, of which the
    numberless floating plants constitute the characteristic vegetation of
    the Sargasso Sea.</p>

  <p>Palaeobotanical literature is full of descriptions of supposed fossil
    representatives of the brown algae, but only a few of the recorded
    species possess more than a very doubtful value; most of them are
    worthless as trustworthy botanical records. Many of the numerous
    impressions referred to as species of <i>Fucoides</i> and other
    genera present a superficial resemblance to the thallus of the common
    Bladder-wrack and other brown seaweeds. Such similarity of form,
    however, in the case of flat and branched algal-like fossils is of no
    scientific value. In many instances the impressions are probably those
    of an alga, but they are of no botanical interest. The flat and forked
    type of thallus of <i>Fucus</i>, <i>Chondrus crispus</i> (L.) and
    other members of the Phaeophyceae is met with also among the red and
    green algae, to say nothing of its occurrence in the group of thalloid
    Liverworts, or of the almost identical form of various members of the
    animal kingdom. The variety of form of the thallus in one species is
    well illustrated by the common <i>Chondrus crispus</i> (L.). This alga
    was described by Turner<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> in his classic work on the <i>Fuci</i>
    under the name of <i>Fucus crispus</i> as “a marine Proteus.” It
    affords an interesting example of the different appearance presented
    by the same species under different conditions, and at the same time
    it furnishes another proof of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>futility of relying on imperfectly
    preserved external features as taxonomic characters of primary
    importance.</p>

  <p>An example of a supposed Jurassic <i>Fucus</i> is shown in fig. 49, and
    briefly described in the Chapter dealing with fossil Bryophytes.</p>

  <p>Several species of Flysch Algae have recently been referred by
    Rothpletz<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> to the Phaeophyceae under the provisional generic name
    <i>Phycopsis</i>, but they are of no special botanical interest.</p>

  <p>The extremely interesting genus <i>Nematophycus</i> has lately been
    assigned by a Canadian author<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> to a position in the Phaeophyceae.
    Although the particular points on which he chiefly relies are not
    perhaps thoroughly established, there are certain considerations which
    lead us to include <i>Nematophycus</i> as a doubtful member of the
    present group of algae.</p>

  <h5 id="Nematophycus"><i>Nematophycus.</i></h5>

  <p>The stem attains a diameter of between 2 and 3 feet in the largest
    specimens; it is made up either of comparatively wide and loosely
    arranged tubes pursuing a slightly irregular vertical course
    accompanied by a plexus of much narrower tubes, or of tubes varying
    in diameter but not divisible into two distinct types. Rings of
    growth occur in some forms but not in others. Radially elongated or
    isodiametric spaces occur in the stem tissues in which the tubes are
    less abundant.</p>

  <p>Reproductive organs unknown, with the possible exception of some very
    doubtful bodies described as spores.</p>

  <p>In 1856 Sir William Dawson proposed the generic name
    <i>Prototaxites</i> for some large silicified trunks discovered in
    the Lower and Middle Devonian rocks of Canada. A few years later the
    same writer<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> published a detailed account of the new fossils and
    arrived at the conclusion that the Devonian stem showed definite points
    of affinity with the recent genus <i>Taxus</i>, and the generic name
    suggests that he regarded it as the type of Coniferous trees belonging
    to the sub-family Taxineae. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>reasons for this determination were
    afterwards shown by Carruthers to be erroneous. Dawson thought he
    recognised pits and spiral thickenings in the walls of the tubular
    elements, as well as pointed ends in some of the latter. The spiral
    markings were in reality small hyphal tubes passing obliquely across
    the face of the wider tubes, and the apparent ends of the supposed
    tracheids were deceptive appearances due to the fact that the tubes
    had in some cases been cut through in an oblique direction. In 1870
    Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> expressed the opinion that Dawson’s <i>Prototaxites</i>
    was a “colossal fossil seaweed” and not a coniferous plant. The same
    author<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> in 1872 published a full and able account of the genus, and
    conclusively proved that <i>Prototaxites</i> could not be accepted as a
    Phanerogam; he brought forward almost convincing evidence in favour of
    including the genus among the algae. The name <i>Prototaxites</i> was
    now changed for that of <i>Nematophycus</i>. Carruthers compares the
    rings of growth in the fossil stems with those in the large Antarctic
    <i>Lessonia</i> stems, but he regards the histological characters as
    pointing to the Siphoneae as the most likely group of recent algae in
    which to include the Palaeozoic genus.</p>

  <p>We may pass over various notes and additional contributions by Dawson,
    who did not admit the corrections to his original descriptions which
    Carruthers’ work supplied. In 1889 an important memoir appeared by
    Penhallow<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> of Montreal in which he confirmed Carruthers’ decision
    as to the algal nature of <i>Prototaxites</i>; he contributed some new
    facts to the previous account by Carruthers, and expressed himself
    in favour of regarding the fossil plant as a near ally of the recent
    Laminariae. The next addition to our botanical knowledge of this
    genus was made by Barber<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> who described a new specific type of
    <i>Nematophycus</i>—<i>N. Storriei</i>—found by Storrie in beds of
    Wenlock limestone age near Cardiff. Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>, in a recent
    memoir on Devonian plants, recorded the occurrence of another species
    of this genus in Middle Devonian rocks near Gräfrath on the Lower
    Rhine. Lastly Penhallow<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>, in describing a new species, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>lays
    stress on the resemblance of some of the tubular elements in the stem
    to the sieve-hyphae of the recent seaweeds <i>Macrocystis</i> and
    <i>Laminaria</i>. He concludes that the new facts he records make it
    clear that <i>Nematophycus</i> “is an alga, and of an alliance with
    the Laminarias.” The recent evidence brought forward by Penhallow
    is not entirely satisfactory; the drawings and descriptions of the
    supposed trumpet-shaped sieve-hyphae are not conclusive. On the whole
    it is probably the better course to speak of <i>Nematophycus</i> as a
    possible ally of the brown algae rather than as an extinct type of the
    Siphoneae, but until our knowledge is more complete it is practically
    impossible to decide the exact position of this Siluro-Devonian genus.</p>

  <p>Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> has suggested that the generic name
    <i>Nematophyton</i>, used by Penhallow in preference to Carruthers’
    term <i>Nematophycus</i>, is the more suitable as being a neutral
    designation and not one which assumes a definite botanical position. In
    view of the nature of the evidence in favour of the algal affinities of
    the fossil, the reasons for discarding Carruthers’ original name are
    hardly sufficient.</p>

  <p>Before discussing more fully the distribution and botanical position
    of <i>Nematophycus</i> we may describe at length one of the best known
    species, and give a short account of some other forms.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Nematophycus Logani</i> (Daws.). Fig. 39, A–E. The stem possesses
    well marked concentric rings of growth due to a periodic difference in
    size of the large tubular elements. The tissues consist of two distinct
    kinds of tubular elements, the larger tubes loosely arranged and
    pursuing a fairly regular longitudinal course, and having a diameter of
    13–35µ; the smaller tubes, with a diameter of 5–6µ, ramify in different
    directions and form a loose plexus among the larger and more regularly
    disposed elements. Branching occurs in both kinds of tubes; septa have
    been recognised only in the smaller tubes. Irregular and discontinuous
    radial spaces traverse the stem tissues, having a superficial
    resemblance in their manner of occurrence to the medullary rays of the
    higher plants.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

  <p>The best specimens of this species were obtained by Sir William
    Dawson from the Devonian Sandstones of Gaspé in New Brunswick. The
    largest stems had a diameter of 3 feet and reached a length of several
    feet<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>; in some examples Dawson found lateral appendages attached
    to the stem which he described as “spreading roots.” Externally the
    specimens were occasionally covered with a layer of friable coal,
    and internally the tissues were found to be more or less perfectly
    preserved by the infiltration of a siliceous solution. Most of the
    examples of <i>Nematophycus</i> from Britain and Germany are much
    smaller and less perfectly preserved than those from Canada. The
    Peter Redpath Museum, Montreal, contains several very large blocks of
    <i>Nematophycus</i>, in many of which one sees the concentric rings of
    growth clearly etched out by weathering agents in a cross section of a
    large stem.</p>

  <p>In fig. 39, A, a sketch is given of a thin transverse section of a
    stem, drawn natural size. The lines of growth are clearly seen, and
    as in coniferous stems the breadth of the concentric zones varies
    considerably. The short lines traversing the tissues in a radial
    direction represent the medullary-ray-like spaces referred to in the
    specific diagnosis. A transverse section examined under a low-power
    objective presents the appearance of a number of thick-walled and
    comparatively wide tubes loosely arranged; they may be in contact or
    separated from one another. If the microscope be carefully focussed
    through the thickness of the section the transversely-cut tubes appear
    to move laterally, producing a curiously dazzling effect if the
    objective is raised or lowered rapidly. This lateral movement is due
    to the undulating vertical course of the tubes. Under a higher power
    the lighter-coloured matrix in which the tubes are embedded shows a
    number of very much smaller and thinner-walled hyphal elements; some
    of these are cut across transversely, others more or less obliquely
    and others again longitudinally. These smaller tubes constitute an
    irregular plexus surrounding and ramifying between the larger elements.
    The diameter of the larger tubes decreases for a certain distance in
    a radial direction as seen in a transverse section, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>and this change
    in size gives rise to the appearance of concentric lines indicating
    periodic changes in growth.</p>

  <p>The radial spaces are characterised by the partial absence of the
    larger tubes, and as seen in longitudinal sections these spaces
    constitute regions in which the smaller tubes branch very freely. Fig.
    39, B, represents a small piece of a transverse section seen under a
    fairly high power. In fig. 39, C, the tubes are seen in longitudinal
    section. The larger elements are unseptate and not very regular in
    their vertical course through the stem; the smaller elements are
    seen as fine tubes lying between and across the larger tubes. In the
    sections I have examined no undoubted transverse septa were detected in
    any of the tubular elements.</p>

  <p>The question as to the possible connection between the larger and
    smaller elements is one which is not as yet satisfactorily disposed of.
    Penhallow<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> regards the finer hyphal elements as branches of the
    larger tubes, but Barber<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>, who has carefully examined good material
    of <i>Nematophycus Logani</i>, was unable to detect any organic
    connection between the two. My own observations are in accord with
    those of Barber. Further details and numerous figures of this species
    of <i>Nematophycus</i> will be found in the memoirs of Carruthers,
    Penhallow and Barber.</p>

  <p>Some specimens of silicified <i>Nematophycus</i> stems afford
    particularly instructive examples of the state of preservation or
    method of mineralisation as a source of error in histological work.
    The sketches reproduced in fig. 39, D and E, were made from a section
    of a large specimen of <i>Nematophycus</i> in the British Museum. In
    fig. D we have one of the radial spaces containing some indistinct
    small elements, the tissue surrounding the space appears to consist
    of polygonal cells suggesting ordinary parenchymatous tissue. In fig.
    E a few of these ‘cells’ are seen more clearly, they have black and
    ragged walls, and often contain very small and faint circles of which
    the precise nature is uncertain. The true interpretation of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>this
    form of structure was first supplied by Penhallow<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>. The black
    network simulating parenchymatous tissue consists of the substance
    of <i>Nematophycus</i> tubes which has been completely redistributed
    during fossilisation and collected along fairly regular lines, as seen
    in figs. D and E. The original structure has been almost completely
    destroyed, and the material composing the walls of the large tubes has
    finally been rearranged as a network, interrupted here and there by the
    characteristic radial spaces which remain as evidence of the original
    <i>Nematophycus</i> characters. It is possible in some cases to trace
    every gradation from sections exhibiting the normal structure through
    those having the appearance shown in figs. D and E to others in which
    the structure is completely lost. Penhallow describes this method of
    fossilisation in <i>N. crassus</i> (Daws.); an examination of several
    specimens in the National Collection leads me to entirely confirm his
    general conclusions, and also to the opinion that <i>N. Logani</i>
    shows exactly the same manner of mineralisation as <i>N. crassus</i>.
    The chief point of interest as regards this method of preservation lies
    in the fact that a fossil described by Dawson<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> as <i>Celluloxylon
    primaevum</i>, and referred to as a probable conifer, is undoubtedly
    a badly preserved <i>Nematophycus</i>. Penhallow examined Dawson’s
    specimens and obtained convincing evidence of their identity with
    certain forms of highly altered <i>Nematophycus</i> stems.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Nematophycus Storriei</i> Barber. Fig. 40. The specimens on which
    Barber<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> founded this species were obtained by Mr Storrie from the
    Tymawr quarry near Cardiff, in beds of Wenlock age. The fragmentary
    nature of the material is largely compensated for by the excellence of
    the preservation. We may briefly define the species as follows:</p>

  <p>The stem consists of separate interlacing undivided and usually
    unbranched tubes of varying diameter. Spaces more or less isodiametric
    in dimensions are scattered through the tissue. The spaces constitute
    regions in which the tubular elements branch freely.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

  <p>The main distinguishing features of this British species are (i) the
    absence of two distinct and well-defined forms of tubular elements.
    The main part of the stem consists of thick walled tubes similar to
    those of <i>N. Logani</i>, but the spaces between them are occupied by
    thinner-walled and smaller tubes varying considerably in diameter; (ii)
    the form of the spaces which are not radially elongated as in <i>N.
    Logani</i>.</p>

    <figcaption class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 40. <i>Nematophycus Storriei</i> Barb.
      Longitudinal section, from a photograph by Mr C. A. Barber. × 45.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Fig. 40 shows the undulating course of the tubes as seen in a
    longitudinal section; the black colour of some of the elements is
    due to the fact that the surface of the wall is seen, while in the
    lighter-coloured portions of the tubes the wall has been cut through.
    The lighter patch about the middle of the figure shows the form of one
    of the spaces in which the tubes are freely branched.</p>

  <p>In addition to the two species already described six others have been
    recorded, but with these we need not concern ourselves in detail. One
    of these species, <i>N. Hicksi</i>, was found by Dr Hicks<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> in the
    Denbighshire grits quarry of Pen-y-Glog near Corwen in North Wales. The
    position of these beds has <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>recently been determined by Mr Lake<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> as
    corresponding to that of the Wenlock limestone. This species and <i>N.
    Storriei</i> are both Silurian examples of the genus. It is possible,
    as Barber has suggested, that the specimens described under these two
    names should be referred to one species. The specimens found by Hicks
    were small and imperfectly preserved fragments; Etheridge has given
    a full description of their structure, and Barber has subsequently
    examined the material. The preservation is not such as will admit
    of any very precise specific diagnosis; the fragments are correctly
    referred to <i>Nematophycus</i>, but their specific characters cannot
    be clearly determined.</p>

  <p>Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> has described some fragments of another species
    of <i>Nematophycus</i> from the Devonian rocks of the Lower Rhine.
    His specimens are chiefly interesting as extending the geographical
    range of the genus, and as affording examples of a curious method of
    preservation. The specimens obtained were small fragments, flattened
    and very dark brown in colour. The tubular elements consisted of an
    external membrane of black coal, enclosing a central core of dark red
    iron-oxide. On burning the fragment on a piece of platinum foil the
    coal composing the wall of the tubes was removed and the deep-red casts
    of the tube-cavities remained<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>. The investigation of the structural
    characters of this imperfect material was conducted by reflected light.
    Under certain conditions, when it is impossible to obtain thin sections
    for examination by transmitted light, it is possible to accomplish
    much, as shown by Solms-Laubach’s work, by means of observation with
    direct light.</p>

  <p>The last species to be noticed is <i>Nematophycus Ortoni</i> recently
    described by Penhallow. There are no concentric rings of growth,
    no radial spaces and no smaller hyphae in the tissues of this
    type of stem. In longitudinal section, the tubes show occasional
    local expansions of the lumen which Penhallow compares with the
    ‘trumpet-hyphae’ of some recent brown algae. No actual sieve-plates
    or transverse walls have been detected, but the general appearance of
    the tubes is considered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>to afford distinct evidence of the original
    existence of such walls. The figures accompanying the description do
    not carry conviction as to the correctness of the reference of the
    tubes to imperfectly preserved sieve-hyphae.</p>

  <p>The following list, taken, with a few alterations, from Penhallow’s
    memoir<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>, shows the geographical and geological range of the species
    of <i>Nematophycus</i> hitherto recorded.</p>

  <p>In summing up our information as to the structure of
    <i>Nematophycus</i> we find there are certain points not definitely
    settled, and which are of considerable importance. The few recorded
    instances of spore-like bodies by Penhallow and Barber are not
    satisfactory; we are still ignorant of the nature of the reproductive
    organs. Such instances of lateral appendages as have been referred to
    do not throw much light on the habit of the plant. So far as we know
    at present the stem of <i>Nematophycus</i> was not differentiated
    internally into a cortical and central region. It may be that the
    specimens have been only partially preserved, and the coaly layer
    which occasionally surrounds a stem may represent a carbonised cortex
    which has never been petrified. The large and loosely arranged tubes
    constitute the chief characteristic feature of the genus; in some cases
    (<i>N. Logani</i>) there is an accompanying plexus of smaller hyphae,
    in others (<i>N. Storriei</i>) there is no definite division of the
    tissue into two sets of tubes of uniform size, and in <i>N. Ortoni</i>
    the tubular elements are all of the large type.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

  <p>Penhallow has recognised the branching of large tubes in <i>N.
    Logani</i> and <i>N. crassus</i> giving rise to the small hyphal
    elements. In most specimens, however, no such mode of origin of
    the smaller tubes can be detected. The spaces which interrupt the
    homogeneity of the tissues in some forms have been described as
    branching depots, on account of the frequent occurrence in these areas
    of much branched hyphae. The function of these spaces (fig. 39, D, and
    fig. 40) may be connected with aeration of the stem-tissues.</p>

  <p>As Carruthers first pointed out the unseptate nature of the elements
    and the occurrence of large and small tubes forming a comparatively
    lax tissue suggested affinities with such recent genera as
    <i>Penicillus</i>, <i>Halimeda</i>, <i>Udotea</i> and other members
    of the Siphoneae. In those fossil stems which possess tubes of two
    distinct sizes, we cannot as a rule trace any organic connection
    between the two sets of tubular elements. Transverse septa have been
    detected in the tubes of some specimens of <i>N. Logani</i>. These
    considerations and the large size and habit of growth of the stem leave
    one sceptical as to the wisdom of assigning the fossil genus to the
    Siphoneae. On the other hand, apart from the doubtful sieve-hyphae of
    Penhallow, the manner of growth of the plant, the concentric rings,
    marked by a decrease in the diameter of the tubes, the lax arrangement
    and irregular course of the elements, afford points of agreement with
    some recent Phaeophyceae. The stem of a <i>Laminaria</i> (fig. 29) or
    of a <i>Lessonia</i> are the most obvious structures with which to
    compare <i>Nematophycus</i>. The medullary region of a <i>Laminaria</i>
    or <i>Fucus</i> and of other genera presents a certain resemblance to
    the tissues of the fossil stems. On the whole we may be content to
    leave <i>Nematophycus</i> for the present as probably an extinct type
    of alga, more closely allied to the large members of the Phaeophyceae
    than to any other recent seaweeds.</p>

  <h5 class="mb0" id="Pachytheca"><i>Pachytheca.</i></h5>

  <div class="center">(A fossil of uncertain affinity.)</div>

  <p>There is another fossil occasionally associated with
    <i>Nematophycus</i> and referred by many writers to the Algae, which
    calls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span> for a brief notice. <i>Pachytheca</i> is too doubtful a genus to
    justify a detailed treatment in the present work. Although, as I have
    elsewhere suggested<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>, we are hardly in a position to speak with any
    degree of certainty as to its affinity, it is not improbable that it
    may eventually be shown to be an alga.</p>

  <p>Without attempting a full diagnosis of the genus, we may briefly refer
    to its most striking characters.</p>

  <p><i>Pachytheca</i> usually occurs in the form of small spherical bodies,
    about ·5 cm. in diameter, in Old Red Sandstone or Silurian rocks. In
    section a single sphere is found to consist of two well marked regions;
    in the centre, of a number of ramifying and irregularly placed narrow
    tubes, and in the peripheral or cortical region, of numerous regular
    and radially disposed simple or forked septate tubes. The tubular
    elements of the two regions are in organic connection.</p>

  <p>The name was proposed by Sir Joseph Hooker for some specimens found
    by Dr Strickland<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> in the Ludlow bone-bed (Silurian) of Woolhope
    and May-Hill. Examples were subsequently recorded from the Wenlock
    limestone of Malvern and from Silurian and Old Red Sandstone rocks of
    other districts. Hicks<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> found <i>Pachytheca</i> in the Pen-y-Glog
    grits of Corwen in association with <i>Nematophycus</i>, and the two
    fossils have been found together elsewhere. This association led
    to the suggestion that <i>Pachytheca</i> might be the sporangium
    of <i>Nematophycus</i>, and Dawson<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>, in conformity with his
    belief in the coniferous character of the latter plant, referred to
    <i>Pachytheca</i> as a true seed.</p>

  <p>The best sections of this fossil have been prepared with remarkable
    skill by Mr Storrie of Cardiff; they were carefully examined and
    described by Barber in two memoirs<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> published in the <cite>Annals of
    Botany</cite>, the account being illustrated by several well executed
    drawings and microphotographs.</p>

  <p>Among other difficulties to contend against in the interpretation of
    <i>Pachytheca</i> there is that of mineralisation. The preservation
    is such as to render the discrimination of original structure as
    distinct from structural features of secondary origin, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>consequent on
    a particular manner of crystallisation of the siliceous material, a
    matter of considerable difficulty.</p>

  <p>Suggestions as to the nature of <i>Pachytheca</i> have been
    particularly numerous; it has been referred to most classes of
    plants and relegated by some writers to the animal kingdom. The most
    recent addition to our knowledge of this problematic fossil was the
    discovery of a specimen by Mr Storrie in which the <i>Pachytheca</i>
    sphere rested in a small cup, like an acorn fruit in its cupule.
    This specimen was figured and described by Mr George Murray<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> in
    1895; he expresses the opinion that the discovery makes the taxonomic
    position of the genus still more obscure. Solms-Laubach briefly
    refers to <i>Pachytheca</i> in connection with <i>Nematophycus</i>,
    and regards its precise nature almost as much an unsolved riddle now
    as it was when first discovered. For a fuller account of this fossil
    reference must be made to the contributions of Hooker<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>, Barber<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
    and others. The literature is quoted by Barber and more recently
    by Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>. There are several specimens and microscopic
    sections of <i>Pachytheca</i> in the geological and botanical
    departments of the British Museum. The genus has been recorded from
    Shropshire, North Wales, Malvern, Herefordshire, Perthshire and other
    British localities, as well as from Canada; it occurs in both Silurian
    and Old Red Sandstone rocks.</p>

  <h5 id="Algites"><i>Algites.</i></h5>

  <p>A generic name for those fossils which in all probability belong to
    the class Algae, but which, by reason of the absence of reproductive
    organs, internal structure, or characters of a trustworthy nature in
    the determination of affinity, cannot be referred with any degree of
    certainty to a particular recent genus or family.</p>

  <p>This term was suggested in 1894<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> as a provisional and comprehensive
    designation under which might be included such impressions or casts
    as might reasonably be referred to Algae. The practice of applying to
    alga-like fossils names suggestive of a definite alliance with recent
    genera is as a rule unsound. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>It would simplify nomenclature, and avoid
    the multiplication of generic names, if the term <i>Algites</i> were
    applied to such algal fossils from rocks of various ages as afford
    no trustworthy data by which their family or generic affinity can be
    established.</p>

  <h3 id="MYXOMYCETES">V. MYXOMYCETES (MYCETOZOA).</h3>

  <p>This class of organisms affords an interesting example of the
    impossibility of maintaining a hard and fast line between the animal
    and plant kingdom. Zoologists and Botanists usually include the
    Myxomycetes<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> in the text-books of their respective subjects,
    and the name Animal-fungi which has been applied to these organisms
    expresses their dual relationship. They constitute one of three groups
    which we may include in that intermediate zone or ‘buffer-state’
    between the two kingdoms. From a palaeobotanical point of view the
    Myxomycetes are of little interest, but a very brief reference may be
    made to them rather for the sake of avoiding unnecessary incompleteness
    in our classification than from their importance as possible fossils.</p>

  <p>They are organisms without chlorophyll, consisting of a naked mass of
    protoplasm, known as the <em>plasmodium</em>, which may attain a size
    of several inches. Such plasmodia creep over the surface of decaying
    organic substrata, and in forming their asexual reproductive cells
    they are converted into somewhat complex fruits containing spores. The
    spores produce motile swarm-cells, which eventually coalesce together
    to form a new plasmodium.</p>

  <p>A few examples of fossil Myxomycetes have been recorded from the
    Palaeozoic and more recent formations, but none of them are entirely
    beyond suspicion. We may mention three examples of fossils referred to
    this group, but only one of these is entitled to serious consideration.</p>

  <p id="Myxomycetes_Mangini"><i>Myxomycetes Mangini</i> Ren.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> It is not uncommon to find
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>distinct traces of original or secondary cell-contents in well
    preserved petrified plant-tissues. There is often a difficulty,
    however, in distinguishing between the true cell-contents and the
    cells of some parasitic or saprophytic intruder. In some petrified
    corky tissue in a silicified nodule from the Permo-Carboniferous beds
    of Autun, Renault has recently discovered what he believes to be
    traces of a Myxomycetous plasmodium. The cork-cells would be without
    protoplasmic contents of their own, and their cavities contain a
    number of fine strands stretching from the cell-walls in different
    directions and uniting in places as irregular or more or less
    spherical masses. The drawings given by Renault of these irregular
    reticulated structures with scattered patches of what may possibly be
    petrified plasmodial protoplasm bear a striking resemblance to the
    plasmodium of a Myxomycete. A figure of the capillitium of a species
    of <i>Leocarpus</i> figured by Schröter<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> in his account of the
    Myxomycetes in Engler and Prantl’s work is very similar to that of
    Renault’s ‘plasmodium.’</p>

  <p>It is by no means inconceivable that the <i>Myxomycetes Mangini</i> may
    be correctly referred to this group, but the wisdom of assigning a name
    to such structures may well be questioned.</p>

  <div class="clear center">
    •<span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span><span class="col2">•</span>
  </div>

  <p>The other two examples call for little notice. Messrs Cash and
    Hick<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> in a paper on fossil fungi from the Coal-Measures refer to
    some small spherical bodies as possibly the spores of a Myxomycete.
    They might be referred equally well to numerous other organisms.</p>

  <p>Göppert and Menge<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> in their monograph on plants in the Baltic
    Tertiary Amber, express the opinion that an ill-defined tangle of
    threads which they figure may be a Myxomycete.</p>

  <p>It would serve no useful purpose to quote other instances of possible
    representatives of fossil Mycetozoa; but the consideration of the above
    examples may serve to emphasize the desirability of refraining from
    converting a possibility into an apparently recognised fact by the
    application of definite generic and specific names.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

  <h3 id="FUNGI">VI. FUNGI.</h3>

  <p>The most striking difference between the fungi and algae is the
    absence of chlorophyll in the former, and the consequent inability of
    fungi to manufacture their organic compounds from inorganic material.
    Fungi live therefore either as parasites or saprophytes, and as the
    same species may pass part of its life in a living host to occur at
    another stage of its development as a saprophyte, it is impossible to
    distinguish definitely between parasitic and saprophytic forms. The
    vegetative body of a fungus, that is the portion which is concerned
    with providing nourishment and preparing the plastic food-substance
    for the reproductive organs, is known as the <em>mycelium</em>.
    It consists either of a single and branched tubular cell known
    as a <em>hypha</em>, or of several hyphae or thread-like elements
    (filamentous fungi). The hyphal filaments may be closely packed
    together and form a felted mass of compact tissue, which in cross
    section closely simulates the parenchyma of the higher plants. This
    pseudoparenchymatous form of thallus is particularly well illustrated
    by the so-called <em>sclerotia</em>; these are sharply defined and
    often tuberous masses of hyphal tissue covered by a firm rind and
    containing supplies of food in the inner hyphae. They are able to
    remain in a quiescent state for some time, and to resist unfavourable
    conditions until germination and the formation of a new individual
    take place. The reproductive structures assume various forms; in some
    of the simpler fungi (Phycomycetes) sexual organs occur, as in the
    parallel group of Siphoneae among the algae, but in the higher fungi
    the reproduction is usually entirely asexual. An interesting case has
    recently been recorded among the more highly differentiated fungi in
    which distinct sexuality has been established<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>. In addition to
    the reproductive organs, such as oogonia and antheridia, the asexual
    cells or spores are borne either in special sporangia, or they occur as
    exposed <em>conidia</em> on supporting hyphae or <em>conidiophores</em>.
    Thick-walled and resistant resting-spores of various forms are also met
    with.</p>

  <p>Before describing a few examples of fossil fungi, it is important
    to consider the general question of their manner of occurrence and
    determination. Considering the small size and delicate nature of
    most fungi, it is not surprising that we have but few satisfactory
    records of well-defined fossil forms. The large leathery sporophores
    of <i>Polyporus</i> and other genera of the Basidiomycetes, which are
    familiar objects as yellow or brown brackets projecting from the trunks
    of diseased forest trees, have been found in a fairly perfect condition
    in the Cambridgeshire peat-beds, and examples have been described also
    by continental writers<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>. As a general rule, however, we have to
    depend on the chance mineralisation or petrifaction of the hyphae of a
    fungus-mycelium which has invaded the living or dead tissues of some
    higher plant. In the literature on fossil plants there are numerous
    recorded species of fungi founded on dark coloured spots and blotches
    on the impression of a leaf. Most of such records are worthless; the
    external features being usually too <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>imperfect to allow of accurate
    identification. The occurrence of recent fungi as discolourations on
    leaves is exceedingly common, and the characteristic <em>perithecia</em>
    or compact and more or less spherical cases enclosing a group of
    sporangia in certain Ascomycetous species, might be readily preserved
    in a fossil condition.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">ASCOMYCETES.</div>

  <p>Some examples of possible Ascomycetous fungi have been recently
    recorded by Potonié from leaves and other portions of plants of
    Permian age. There is a distinct superficial resemblance between the
    specimens he figures and the fructifications of recent Ascomycetes,
    but in the absence of internal structure, it would be rash to do
    more than suggest the probable nature of the markings he describes.
    For one of the fungus-like impressions Potonié proposes the generic
    name <i>Rosellinites</i>; he compares certain irregularly shaped
    projections on a piece of Permian wood with the perithecia of
    <i>Rosellinia</i>, a member of the Sphaeriaceae, and describes them
    as <i>Rosellinites Beyschlagii</i> Pot.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Various other records
    of similar Ascomycetes-like fossils may be found in palaeobotanical
    literature<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>, but it is unnecessary to examine these in detail.
    Unless we are able to determine the nature of the supposed fungus by
    microscopical methods our identifications cannot in most cases be of
    any great value.</p>

  <p>An example of the perithecia of a fungus (<i>Rosellinia congregata</i>
    [Beck])<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> has been recorded from the Oligocene of Saxony, which
    would appear to rest on a more satisfactory basis than is often the
    case. In this particular instance the small projections on a piece of
    fossil coniferous stem present a form which naturally suggests a fungus
    perithecium. In cases where the black spots on a fossil stem or leaf
    possess a definite form and structure, it is perfectly legitimate to
    refer them to a group of fungi; but in very many instances the forms
    referred to such genera as <i>Sphaerites</i> and others are of little
    or no value. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>Many forms of scale-insects and galls on leaves present
    an obvious superficial resemblance to epiphyllous fungi, and might
    readily be mistaken for the fructifications of certain Ascomycetous
    species. As examples of scale-insects simulating fungi, reference
    may be made to such genera of the Coccineae as <i>Aspidiotus</i>,
    <i>Diaspis</i>, <i>Lecanium</i>, <i>Coccus</i>, and others. The female
    insects lying on the surface of a leaf, if preserved as a fossil
    impression, might easily be mistaken for perithecia<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>.</p>

  <p>Another pitfall in fossil mycology may be illustrated by a description
    of a supposed fungus, <i>Sclerotites Salisburiae</i><a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>, Mass. on a
    Tertiary <i>Ginkgo</i> leaf. The figure given by Massalongo represents
    a <i>Ginkgo</i> leaf with well marked veins, the lamina between the
    veins being traversed by short discontinuous and longitudinally-running
    lines; the latter are referred to as the fungus. In a recent
    <i>Ginkgo</i> leaf one may easily detect with the naked eye a number
    of short lines between and parallel to the veins, which if examined
    in section are found to be secretory canals. There can be little
    doubt that <i>Sclerotites Salisburiae</i> owes its existence to the
    preservation of these canals.</p>

  <p>The list of fossil fungi given by Meschinelli in Saccardo’s <i>Sylloge
    Fungorum</i><a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> includes certain species which are of no botanical
    value, and should have no place in any list which claims to be
    authentic.</p>

  <p>Among the numerous examples of fossil ‘fungi’ which have no claim to
    be classed with plants, there are some which are in all probability
    the galleries of wood-eating animals. The radiating grooves frequently
    found on the inner face of the bark of a pine tree made by species of
    the beetle <i>Bostrychus</i> might be mistaken for the impressions of
    the firm strands of mycelial tissue of some Basidiomycetous fungus.</p>

  <p>In some notes on fossil fungi by J. F. James<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> contributed to
    the American Journal of Mycology in 1893, it is pointed out that a
    supposed fungus described by Lesquereux from the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>Lower Coal-Measures
    as <i>Rhizomorpha Sigillariae</i><a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>, bears a strong likeness to some
    insect-burrows, such as those of <i>Bostrychus</i>.</p>

  <p>“A new fungus from the Coal-Measures” described by Herzer in 1893<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
    may probably be referred to animal agency. In any case there is no
    evidence as to the fungoid nature of the object represented in the
    figure accompanying Herzer’s description.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">BASIDIOMYCETES.</div>

  <p>More trustworthy evidence of fossil fungi is afforded by the marks of
    disease in petrified tissue and by the presence of true mycelia. In
    examining closely the calcareous and siliceous plant-tissues from the
    Coal-Measures and other geological horizons, one occasionally sees fine
    thread-like hyphae ramifying through the cells or tracheal cavities;
    in many cases the hyphae bear no reproductive organs and cannot as
    a rule be referred to a particular type of fungus. If the hyphal
    filaments are unseptate, they most likely belong to some Phycomycetous
    species; or if they are obviously septate the Mesomycetes or the
    Mycomycetes are the more probable groups. Occasionally there may be
    found indications of the characteristic <em>clamp-connections</em> in
    the septate filaments; a small semicircular branch, which is given off
    from a mycelium immediately above a transverse wall, bends round to
    fuse with the filament just below the septum, thus serving as a small
    loop-line connecting the cell-cavity above and below a cross wall. Such
    clamp-connections are usually confined to the hyphae of Basidiomycetes
    and thus serve as a useful aid in identification. A good example of a
    clamp-connection in a fossil mycelium is figured by Conwentz<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> in
    his monograph on the Baltic amber-trees of Oligocene age. The stout
    and thick type of hypha found in some fossil woods agrees closely with
    that of <i>Polyporus</i>, <i>Agaricus melleus</i> and other well-known
    recent Basidiomycetes.</p>

  <p>In a section of a piece of lignified coniferous wood recently brought
    by Col. Feilden from Kolguev island<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>, the brown and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>stout hyphae
    of a fungus are clearly seen as distinct dark lines traversing the
    tracheal tissue. The occurrence of septa and the large diameter of the
    mycelial branches at once suggest a comparison with such recent forms
    as <i>Agaricus melleus</i>, <i>Polyporus</i> and other Basidiomycetes.
    The age of the Kolguev wood is not known with any certainty.</p>

  <p>The vesicular swellings such as those represented in fig. 41, A, B, D
    and E, may easily be misinterpreted. Such spherical expansions in a
    mycelium, either terminal or intercalary, may be sporangia, oogonia or
    large resting-spores, or non-fungal cell-contents, and it is usually
    impossible in the absence of the contents to determine their precise
    nature. Hartig<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and others have drawn attention to the occurrence
    of such bladder-like swellings in the mycelia of recent fungi, which
    have nothing to do with reproductive purposes; under certain conditions
    the hyphae of a fungus growing in the cavity of a cell or trachea
    may form such vesicles, and these, as in fig. 42, D, <i>m</i> may
    completely fill up the cavity of a large tracheid.</p>

  <p>Some good examples of bladder-like swellings, such as occur in the
    mycelium of <i>Agaricus melleus</i> and other recent fungi, have
    been figured by Conwentz<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> in fossil wood of Tertiary age from
    Karlsdorf. The swellings in this fossil fungus might easily be mistaken
    for oogonia or sporangia; especially as they are few in number and
    spherical in form.</p>

  <p>A similar appearance is presented by a mass of tyloses in the cavity of
    an old vessel or tracheid; and vesicular cell-contents, as in the cells
    of fig. 41, A, 2–5, may closely simulate a number of thin-walled fungal
    spores or sporangia.</p>

  <p>A good example of such a vesicular tissue, in addition to that already
    quoted, is afforded by a specimen of an Eocene fern, <i>Osmundites
    Dowkeri</i> Carr.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> described by Carruthers in 1870. The
    ground-tissue cells contain traces of distinct fungal hyphae (fig. 41,
    B), and in many of the parenchymatous elements the cavity is completely
    filled with spherical vesicles; in other cases one finds hyphae in the
    centre of the cell while vesicles line the wall, as shewn in fig. 41,
    B. Carruthers refers to these <span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>bladders as starch grains, and this
    may be their true nature; their appearance and abundant occurrence in
    the parenchyma certainly suggest vesicular cell-contents rather than
    fungal cells. I could detect no proof of any connection between the
    hyphae and bladders, and the absence of the latter in the cavities of
    the tracheids, fig. 41, C, favoured the view of their being either
    starch-grains or other vacuolated contents similar to that in the cells
    of the Portland Cycad (fig. 41, A) referred to on p. 88.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PATHOLOGY OF FOSSIL TISSUES.</div>

  <p>The vacuolated cell-contents partially filling the cells in fig. 41, D,
    present a striking resemblance to the contents of the cells 2–5 in fig.
    41, A. In fig. D the frothy and contracted substance might be easily
    mistaken for a parasitic or saprophytic fungus, but this resemblance
    is entirely misleading. It is by no means uncommon to find the cells
    of recent plants occupied by such vacuolated contents, especially in
    diseased tissues in which a pathological effect produces an appearance
    which has more than once misled the most practised observers.</p>

  <p>In the important work recently published by Renault on the
    Permo-Carboniferous flora of Autun, there is a small spore-like body
    described as a teleutospore, and classed with the Puccineae<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>.
    We have as yet no satisfactory evidence of the existence of this
    section of Fungi in Palaeozoic times, and Renault’s description of
    <i>Teleutospora Milloti</i> from Autun might be seriously misleading
    if accepted without reference to his figure. The fragment he describes
    cannot be accepted as sufficient evidence for the existence of a
    Palaeozoic <i>Puccinia</i>.</p>

  <p>The same author refers another Palaeozoic fungus to the Mucorineae
    under the name of <i>Mucor Combrensis</i><a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>; this identification
    is based on a mycelium having a resemblance to the branched thallus
    of <i>Mucor</i>, but in the absence of reproductive organs such
    resemblance is hardly adequate as a means of recognition.</p>

  <p>The occurrence of hyphal cells in calcareous shells and corals has
    already been alluded to.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> In addition to the examples referred to
    above, there is one which has been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>described by Etheridge<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> from
    a Permo-Carboniferous coral. This observer records the occurrence of
    tubular cavities in the calices of <i>Stenopora crinita</i> Lonsd.,
    and attributes their origin to a fungus which he names <i>Palaeoperone
    endophytica</i>; he mentions one case in which a tube contains fine
    spherical spore-like bodies which he compares with the spores of
    a <i>Saprolegnia</i>. As pointed out above (p. 128), it is almost
    impossible to decide how far these tubes in shells and corals should be
    attributed to fungi, and how far to algae.</p>

  <p>Passing from the direct evidence obtained from the presence of fungal
    hyphae in petrified tissues, we must draw attention to the indirect
    evidence of fungal action afforded by many fossil plants. It is
    important to be familiar with at least the more striking effects of
    fungal ravages in recent wood in order that we may escape some of the
    mistakes to which pathological phenomena may lead us in the case of
    fossils<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>.</p>

  <p>The gradual dissociation of the elements in a piece of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>fossil wood
    owing to the destruction of the middle lamellae, the occurrence of
    various forms of slit-like apertures in the walls of tracheids (fig.
    42, E) and the production of a system of fine parallel striation on
    the walls of a vessel are among the results produced by parasitic and
    saprophytic fungi. With the help of a ferment secreted by its hyphae,
    a fungus is able to eat away either the thickening cell layers or the
    middle lamellae or both, and if, as in fig. 42, A, only the middle
    lamellae are left one might easily regard such tissue in a fossil
    condition as consisting of delicate thin-walled elements. The oblique
    striae on the walls of a tracheid may often be due to the action of a
    ferment which has dissolved the membrane in such a manner as to etch
    out a system of spiral lines, probably as a consequence of the original
    structure of the tracheids. In distinguishing between the woods of
    Conifers the presence of spiral thickening layers in the wood element
    is an important diagnostic character, and it is necessary to guard
    against the confusion of purely secondary structures, due to fungal
    action, with original features which may be of value in determining the
    generic affinity of a piece of fossil wood.</p>

  <h5 id="Oochytrium_Lepidodendri"><i>Oochytrium Lepidodendri</i>, Ren. Fig. 43, 1.</h5>

  <p>Under this name Renault has recently described a filamentous fungus endophytic in the
    cavities of the scalariform tracheids of a <i>Lepidodendron</i><a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>.
    The mycelium has the form of slender branched hyphae with transverse
    septa. Numerous ovoid and more or less spherical sporangia occur as
    terminal swellings of the mycelial threads. The long axis of the ovoid
    forms measures 12–15 µ, and the shorter axis 9–10 µ; the contents may
    be seen as a slightly contracted mass in the sporangial cavity. In some
    of the sporangia one sees a short apical prolongation in the form of a
    small elongated papilla, as shown in fig. 43, 1. Renault refers this
    fungus to the Chytridineae, and compares it with <i>Cladochytrium</i>,
    <i>Woronina</i>, <i>Olpidium</i>, and other recent genera.</p>

  <p>In the immediate neighbourhood of two of the sporangia shown in the
    uppermost tracheid of fig. 43, 1, there are seen a few minute dark dots
    which are described as spores petrified <span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>in the act of escaping from a
    lateral pore. This interpretation strikes one as lacking in scientific
    caution.</p>

  <p>The sporangia of <i>Hyphochytrium infestans</i><a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>, as figured by
    Fischer in Rabenhorst’s work bear a close resemblance to those of the
    fossil. It would seem very probable that Renault’s species may be
    reasonably referred to the Chytridineae, as he proposes.</p>

  <h5 id="Peronosporites_antiquarius"><i>Peronosporites antiquarius</i> W. Smith. Fig. 41, E.</h5>

  <p>In an address to the Geologists’ Association delivered by Mr Carruthers
    in 1876 a brief reference, accompanied by a small-scale drawing, is
    made to the discovery of a fungus in the scalariform tracheids of
    a <i>Lepidodendron</i> from the English Coal-Measures<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>. In the
    following year Worthington Smith published a fuller account of the
    fungus, and proposed for it the above name<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>, which he chose on the
    ground of a close similarity between the mycelium and reproductive
    organs of the fossil form and recent members of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>Peronosporeae.
    In Smith’s description the mycelium is described as bearing spherical
    swellings containing zoospores. These spherical organs are fairly
    abundant and not infrequently met with in sections of petrified
    plant-tissues from the English Coal-Measures; they may be oogonia or
    sporangia, or in some cases mere vesicular expansions of a purely
    vegetative hypha. No confirmation has been given to the supposed spores
    referred to by Smith. Prof. Williamson and others have carefully
    examined the specimens, but they have failed to detect any trace of
    reproductive cells enclosed in the spherical sacs<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>. The mycelium
    does not appear to show any satisfactory evidence of its being septate
    as figured by Smith.</p>

  <p>The example shown in fig. 41 E has been drawn from one of the
    Williamson specimens: it illustrates the form and manner of occurrence
    of the characteristic swellings. It is probable that some at least
    of the vesicles are either sporangia or oogonia, but we cannot speak
    with absolute confidence as to their precise nature. The general
    habit and structure of the fungus favour its inclusion in the class
    of <i>Phycomycetes</i>. The occurrence of several of the vesicles
    close together on short hyphal branches, as shown in Williamson’s
    figures, suggests the spherical swellings on vegetative hyphae, but
    it is impossible to speak with absolute confidence. There is a close
    resemblance between this English form and one recently described by
    Renault as <i>Palaeomyces gracilis</i> Ren.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>; the two fossils
    should probably be placed in the same genus.</p>

  <p>The examples referred to below and originally recorded by Cash and Hick
    no doubt belong to the same type as Smith’s <i>Peronosporites</i>.</p>

  <p>The sketches reproduced in fig. 44 have been drawn from specimens
    originally described by Cash and Hick in 1878<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>. The sections were
    cut from a calcareous nodule from the Halifax Coal-Measures containing
    fragments of various plants and among others a piece of cortical
    tissue, probably of a <i>Lepidodendron</i> or <i>Stigmaria</i>. In a
    transverse section of this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>tissue one sees under a moderately high
    power that the cells have become partially separated from one another
    by the destruction of the middle lamellae (fig. 44 A). The cell-cavities
    and the spaces between the isolated cells contain numerous fine fungal
    hyphae, which here and there terminate in spherical swellings. One
    such swelling is shown under a low power in fig. 44 A, in the middle
    uppermost cell, and more highly magnified in fig. 44 B. In fig. C
    there are two such swellings (the larger one having a diameter of ·003
    mm.) in contact, but the connection does not appear to be organic.
    The cell-walls of the infected tissue present a ragged and untidy
    appearance, and in places (<i>e.g.</i> fig. 44 D) the membrane has been
    pierced by some of the mycelial branches.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>This fungus bears a close resemblance to <i>Peronosporites
    antiquarius</i>, but it is impossible to determine its precise
    botanical position without further data. In Cash and Hick’s paper
    in which the above fungus is briefly dealt with, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> small
    spore-like bodies are figured which the authors speak of as possibly a
    Myxomycetous fungus<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>. There is however no sound reason for such a
    supposition.</p>

  <p>As examples of Ascomycetous fungi found in silicified wood of Tertiary
    age, two species may be quoted from Felix.</p>

  <h5 id="Cladosporites_bipartitus"><i>Cladosporites bipartitus</i> Felix<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>, fig. 43, 3.</h5>

  <p>The mycelium and conidia of this form were discovered in some Eocene silicified wood
    from Perekeschkul near Baku, on the shores of the Caspian. The conidia
    are elliptical or pyriform in shape and divided by a transverse septum
    into two cells. No traces were found of any special conidiophores. The
    mycelium consists of septate branched hyphae, rendered conspicuous by
    a brown colouration. Felix compares the fossil with the recent genera
    <i>Cephalothecium</i> and <i>Cladosporium</i>.</p>

  <h5 id="Haplographites_cateniger"><i>Haplographites cateniger</i> Felix<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>, fig. 43, 4.</h5>

  <p>The conidia of this form were found to be fairly abundant in the silicified tissue
    investigated by Felix; they occur usually in chains of 2 to 6 conidia
    having an ovoid or flask-shaped form, with a thick membrane (fig.
    43, 4). The mycelium consists of branched hyphae divided into long
    cylindrical cells by transverse septa; occasional instances were found
    of an H-shaped fusion between lateral branches of parallel hyphae.</p>

  <p>Felix compares this species with examples of the genera
    <i>Haptographium</i> and <i>Dematium</i> of the family Sphaeriaceae;
    it was found in the woody tissue of a dicotyledonous stem from
    Perekeschkul.</p>

  <h5 id="Zygosporites"><i>Zygosporites</i> sp.</h5>

  <p>The object represented in fig. 41 F consists
    of a stalked spherical sac bearing a number of radiating arms which
    are divided distally into delicate terminations. We find similar
    bodies figured by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> in his IXth and Xth Memoirs on the
    Coal-Measure plants; he includes some of them under the generic term
    <i>Zygosporites</i>, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>compares them with the zygospores of the
    freshwater algae Desmideae. Hitherto these spore-like fossils have
    only been recorded as isolated spheres, but in the example shown in
    fig. 41 F there is a distinct tubular and thin-walled stalk attached
    to the <i>Zygosporites</i>. The specimen was found in the partially
    disorganised cortical tissue of a <i>Lyginodendron</i> stem from the
    English Coal-Measures. It is difficult to decide as to the precise
    nature of the fossil, but the presence of the hyphal stalk points
    to a fungus rather than an alga as the most probable type of plant
    with which to connect it. It may possibly be a sporangium of a fungus
    comparable with the common mould <i>Mucor</i>, or it may be a zygospore
    formed by the conjugation of two hyphae of which only one has been
    preserved.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">POLYPORUS.</div>

  <p>For an example of a fossil representative of the Basidiomycetes we may
    turn to the excellent monograph by Conwentz on the Baltic amber trees,
    and quote one of the forms which he has described.</p>

  <h5 id="Polyporus_vaporarius"><i>Polyporus vaporarius</i> Fr. <i>f. succinea</i><a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436"
    class="fnanchor">[436]</a>, fig. 43, 2.</h5>

  <p>In several preparations of the wood preserved by petrifaction in
    amber Conwentz found distinct indications of the ravages of a fungus,
    which suggested the presence of the recent species <i>Polyporus
    vaporarius</i> Fr. With the help of the indirect evidence afforded by
    the pathological effects as seen in the tissues of the host-plant, and
    the direct evidence of the fungal mycelium Conwentz was led to this
    identification.</p>

  <p>The mycelium is brown in colour, in part thick-walled, and in part with
    thin walls, transversely septate and not much branched. In the portion
    of one of Conwentz’ figures reproduced in fig. 43, 2, the rents and
    holes in the tracheid walls are clearly shown; they afford the indirect
    evidence of fungal attacks, and are of the same nature as those shown
    in fig. 42, B, C and E.</p>

  <p>Enough has been said to call attention to the paucity of exact data on
    which to generalise as to the geological history <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>of fungi. The types
    selected for description or passing allusion have not been chosen in
    each case because of their special intrinsic value, but rather as
    convenient examples by which to illustrate authentic records or to
    serve as warnings against possible sources of error.</p>

  <p>It would seem that we have fairly good and conclusive evidence of the
    existence in Permo-Carboniferous times of Phycomycetous fungi, but
    it is not until we pass to post-Palaeozoic or even Tertiary plants
    that we discover satisfactory representatives of the higher fungi or
    Mycomycetes. If special attention were paid to the investigation of
    fossil fungi, it is quite possible that our knowledge of the past
    history of the group might be considerably extended. It is essential
    that the greatest caution should be exercised in the identification
    of forms and in their reference to definite families; otherwise our
    lists of fossil species will serve to mislead, and to emphasize the
    untrustworthy character of palaeobotanical data. Unless we feel
    satisfied as to the position of a fossil fungus it is unwise to use a
    generic term suggestive of a definite family or recent genus. Such a
    name as Renault has used in one instance, <i>Palaeomyces</i>, might be
    employed as a useful and comprehensive designation.</p>

  <h3 id="CHAROPHYTA">VII. CHAROPHYTA.</h3>

  <div class="center">CHARACEÆ. NITELLEÆ.</div>

  <p>It has been the general custom to include the Characeæ or Stoneworts
    among the Chlorophyceae (green algae), of which they form a distinctly
    isolated family. On the whole, it would seem better to follow the
    course lately adopted by Migula<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> and allow the Characeæ to rank
    as a family of a distinct group, Charophyta. While agreeing in many
    respects with plants higher in the scale than Thallophytes, the
    Stoneworts do not sufficiently resemble the Bryophyta to be included in
    that group.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

  <p>The Charophyta are plants containing chlorophyll, living in fresh
    and brackish water; the stem is jointed, and bears at the nodes
    whorls of leaves, on which are borne the reproductive organs. The
    antheridia are spherical in shape and of complex structure, containing
    numerous biciliate antherozoids. The oogonia are oval in form and
    contain a single large egg-cell. The Chara-plant is developed from
    a <em>protonema</em> formed from the germinating oospore. Vegetative
    reproduction is effected by means of bulbils, accessory shoots, etc.</p>

  <p>The Nitelleæ have not been recognised in a fossil condition. The
    absence or feeble development of a calcareous incrustation renders the
    genera of this family less likely to be preserved than such a genus as
    <i>Chara</i>.</p>

  <h4 id="Chareae">Chareae.</h4>

  <p>Leaves and stems with or without a cortical investment. Fruit with a
    five-celled <em>corona</em>. The envelope of the ‘fruit’ and other parts
    of the plant are frequently encrusted with carbonate of lime.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Chara</i>, the best known member of the family,
    the plant as a whole resembles in its general habit and external
    differentiation of parts the higher plants. The stem consists of long
    internodes separated by short nodes bearing whorls of leaves. Each
    internode consists of a long cylindrical cell, which becomes enclosed
    by a cortical sheath composed of rows of cells which have grown upwards
    and downwards from the peripheral nodal cells. The cortical cells
    are usually spirally twisted and impart to the stem a characteristic
    appearance; they are divided by transverse walls into numerous cells
    some of which occasionally grow out into short processes (fig. 45
    <i>c</i>). The leaves repeat on a smaller scale the structural features
    of the stem, but possess a limited growth, whereas the stem has an
    unlimited power of growth by means of a large hemispherical apical
    cell. Branches arise in the axils of the leaves. The plants are either
    monoecious or dioecious. The oogonium is elliptical in shape, and is
    borne on a short stalk-cell, it contains a single oosphere. The wall
    of the oogonium is formed of five spirally twisted cells which have
    grown over it from the five peripheral cells of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span> leaf-node. The tips
    of the investing cells project at the apex in the form of a terminal
    crown or <em>corona</em> (fig. 45, <i>E</i>, <i>c</i>). The antheridia
    have a complex structure, and produce a very large number of motile
    antherozoids.</p>

  <p>After fertilisation, the egg-cell becomes surrounded by a membrane, at
    first colourless, but afterwards yellow or brown. The inner cell-walls
    of the cells surrounding the oospore become thicker and darker in
    colour; the outer walls remain thin and eventually fall away. The
    lateral walls may or may not become thickened. In most of the Chareae a
    calcareous deposit is formed between the hard shell and the outer walls
    of the cells enveloping the oospore. This calcareous shell is developed
    subsequently to the thickening and hardening of the inner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span> walls of the
    fruit-case. The cells of the corona and stalk do not become calcareous.
    In the fossil Charas, it is this calcareous shell that is preserved.
    In the members of the Chareae the stems are usually encrusted with
    carbonate of lime, and thus have a much better chance of preservation
    than the slightly calcareous Nitelleæ.</p>

  <h5 id="Chara"><i>Chara.</i></h5>

  <p>The generic characters have already been described in the brief account
    of the family Chareae.</p>

  <p>The generic name was proposed by Vaillant in 1719<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>, and adopted
    by Linnaeus, who classed the Stoneworts with aquatic phanerogams. As
    long ago as 1623<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> a figure of <i>Chara</i> was published by Caspar
    Bauhin as a form of <i>Equisetum</i>. The generic name <i>Chara</i> has
    usually been applied to recent and fossil species alike. The existing
    species have a wide distribution; <i>Chara foetida</i>, A. Br., a
    common British form, occurs in practically all parts of the world.
    Stems and calcareous ‘fruit-cases’ occur fairly commonly in a fossil
    state, and differ but little from recent species, at least as regards
    essential features.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to say at what geological horizon the Stoneworts are
    first represented. The first certain traces of <i>Chara</i> occur in
    Jurassic rocks, but certain spirally marked subspherical bodies have
    been recorded from Devonian and Carboniferous strata, which closely
    resemble Chara oogonia, and may be Palaeozoic representatives of the genus.</p>

  <p>In 1889 Mr Knowlton<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> of the American Geological Survey described
    some ‘problematic organisms’ found in Devonian rocks at the falls of
    the Ohio. Examples of these fossils are shown in fig. 46 <i>b</i> and
    <i>c</i>; the spirally grooved body measures from 1·50 to 1·80 mm. in
    diameter, and about 1·70 mm. in length. The Chara-like character of the
    fossils had been previously suggested by Meek<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> in 1873. Without
    going into the arguments for or against placing these fossils in the
    Chareae, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>they may at least be mentioned as possible but not certain
    Palaeozoic forms of <i>Chara</i> or an allied genus.</p>

  <p>In this form the ‘fruits’ are minute and subspherical, ·39-·44 mm. long, and ·35-·40 mm.
    broad, showing in side view 5–6 slightly oblique spiral bands. Each
    spiral band bears a row of slightly projecting tubercles.</p>

  <p>This species was first described by Saporta<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> from the Oxfordian
    (Jurassic) rocks of the Department of Lot in France; it is compared by
    the author of the species with <i>Chara Jaccardi</i> Heer, described by
    Heer from the Upper Jurassic rocks of Switzerland.</p>

  <h5 id="C_Knowltoni">2. <i>C. Knowltoni</i>, Seward. Fig. 45, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, and
    Fig. 47.</h5>

  <p>The Oogonia are broadly oval, about ·5mm. in length, and at
    the broadest part of about the same breadth. The surface is marked by
    eleven or twelve bands in the form of a flattened spiral. The stems
    possess investing cortical cells.</p>

  <p>This species was founded on specimens from the Wealden beds of
    Sussex<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>, but numerous examples of Chara ‘fruits’ and stems have
    long been known from the uppermost Jurassic rocks of the Dorset coast
    and the Isle of Wight, which may probably be included in this species.
    These fossil Charas are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>abundant<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> in the Chert beds of Purbeck age
    seen in the cliffs near Swanage. Pieces of corticated stems from this
    locality are represented in fig. 45 <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</p>

  <p>The cortical cells surrounding a large internodal cell are very clearly
    seen in the section shown in fig. 45 <i>B</i>, and in the longitudinal
    view in fig. 45 <i>A</i>. The resemblance of these specimens to the
    stems of recent Stoneworts is very striking.</p>

  <h5 id="C_Wrighti">3. <i>Chara Wrighti</i>, Forbes. Fig. 46, <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>.</h5>

  <p>This species is characterised by globular or somewhat elliptical oogonia,
    with six or seven spiral bands.</p>

  <p>It is very abundant in the Lower Headon beds of Hordwell Cliffs on the
    Hampshire coast<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>. Various species of <i>Chara</i> are commonly met
    with in the Oligocene beds of the Isle of Wight and Hampshire, as well
    as in the Paris basin beds, and elsewhere. Well preserved ‘fruits’ and
    stem fragments are met with in a siliceous rock of Upper Oligocene age
    imported from Montmorency in the Paris basin, and used as a stone for
    grinding phosphates at some chemical works near Upware, a few miles
    from Cambridge.</p>

  <p>Many other species of fossil Charas are known from various horizons
    and localities, but the above examples suffice as illustrative types.
    In Post-Tertiary deposits masses of <i>Chara</i> and plant fragments
    occasionally occur forming blocks of Travertine. Examples of such Chara
    beds have been recorded by Sharpe from Northampton<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>, by Lyell<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
    from Forfarshire, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>by other writers from several other districts.
    Beds of calcareous marl are occasionally seen as whitish streaks in the
    peat of the Fenland<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>; these often consist in great part of Charas.
    A season’s growth of <i>Chara</i> in a shallow lake or mere in the Fens
    may appear as a white line in a section of peaty and other material
    which has been formed on the site of old pools or lakes.</p>

  <p>The recognition of specific characters in the isolated Chara ‘fruits’
    usually met with in a fossil state is exceedingly unsatisfactory; the
    features usually relied on in the living species are not preserved, and
    great care should be taken in the separation of the various forms.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bryophyta are small plants, varying in size from 1 mm. to about
    30 cm., creeping or erect, having a thalloid, or more usually a
    foliose body, consisting of a cell-mass exhibiting in most cases a
    distinct internal differentiation. They possess no true roots and
    no true vascular tissue. The life-history of the members of the
    group is characterised by a well-marked and definite alternation of
    generations. The Moss or Liverwort plant is the sexual generation
    (<em>gametophyte</em>), and as a result of the fertilisation of an
    egg-cell the asexual or spore-bearing generation (<em>sporophyte</em>)
    is produced. The sporophyte never exhibits a differentiation into
    stem and leaves. Asexual and vegetative reproduction are effected by
    means of spores, bulbils, or detached portions of the plant-body.
    Sexual reproduction is by means of biciliate antherozoids produced in
    <em>antheridia</em> and egg-cells formed singly in <em>archegonia</em>.</p>

  <p>In the Bryophytes the distinguishing characteristics are more
    constant and well-defined than in the Thallophytes. In the former the
    plant never consists of a single cell or coenocyte, but is always
    multicellular, and exhibits in most cases a definite physiological
    division of labour as expressed in the histological differentiation
    of distinct tissue-systems. In the Thallophytes there is no true
    alternation of generation in the same sense as in the Mosses and
    Liverworts and in the higher plants. In the Bryophytes the sexual
    reproduction has reached a higher stage of development and a much
    greater constancy as regards the nature of the reproductive organs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
    On the germination of the spore there is usually formed a fairly
    distinct structure known as the <em>protonema</em>, from which the Moss
    or Liverwort developes as a bud<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>.</p>

  <p>The vegetative plant-body possesses a different organisation on the
    ventral and dorsal side; it has the form of a thalloid creeping plant
    (Thalloid Liverworts), or of a delicate stem with thin appendages or
    leaves without a midrib (Foliose Liverworts). In most cases the body
    of the plant is made up of parenchymatous tissue, showing but little
    internal differentiation; in one or two genera a few strengthening or
    mechanical fibres occur among the thinner walled ground-tissue. On the
    germination of the spore, a feebly developed protonema is produced,
    which gives rise to the Liverwort plant. Reproduction as in the group
    Bryophyta.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">DETERMINATION OF LIVERWORTS.</div>

  <p>The Liverworts have a very wide geographical distribution, and are
    specially abundant in moist shady situations; they grow on stones or
    damp soil, and occur as epiphytes on other plants. <i>Marchantia</i>,
    <i>Pellia</i>, and <i>Jungermannia</i> are among the better known
    British representatives of the class.</p>

  <p>Considering the soft nature of the body of recent Liverworts, it is
    not surprising that they are poorly represented in a fossil state. In
    the absence of the sexual reproductive organs, or of the sporophytes,
    which have scarcely ever been preserved, exact identification is almost
    hopeless. The difficulties already referred to in dealing with the
    algae, as regards the misleading similarity between the form of the
    thallus and the bodies of other plants, have to be faced in the case of
    the Liverworts. Many of the thalloid Liverworts, if preserved in the
    form of a cast or impression without internal structure or reproductive
    organs, could hardly be distinguished from various genera of algae
    in which the thallus has the form of a forked plate-like <span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>body.
    Such genera as <i>Pellia</i>, <i>Marchantia</i>, <i>Lunularia</i>,
    <i>Reboulia</i>, and others bear a striking resemblance to
    <i>Fucus</i>, <i>Chondrus</i> and many other algae.</p>

  <p>Imperfect specimens of certain Lichens, not to mention some of the
    Polyzoa, might easily be mistaken for Liverworts. Among the higher
    plants, there are some forms of the <i>Podostemaceae</i> which
    simulate in habit both thalloid and foliose Liverworts as well as
    Mosses<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>. The members of this Dicotyledonous family are described
    as water-plants with a Moss- or Liverwort-like form; they occur on
    rocks in quickly-flowing water in the tropics. In one instance a
    recent Podostemaceous genus has been described as a member of the
    Anthocerotales; the genus <i>Blandowia</i><a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>, referred to by
    Willdenow as a Liverwort, has since been recognised as one of the
    <i>Podostemaceae</i>. The resemblance between some of the foliose
    <i>Hepaticae</i> and genera of Mosses is often very close. In certain
    Mosses, such as <i>Hookeria pennata</i><a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>, the large two-ranked
    leaves suggest the branches of a <i>Selaginella</i>.</p>

  <p>The plant reproduced in fig. 48 A (<i>Tristichia</i>), one of the
    Podostemaceae, might easily be mistaken for a foliose Liverwort if
    found as a fragmentary fossil. Such species of <i>Selaginella</i> as
    <i>S. Oregana</i> Eat. and <i>S. rupestris</i> Spring (fig. 48 C)
    have a distinctly moss-like habit and do not present a very obvious
    resemblance to the more typical and better known Selaginellas. The twig
    of a <i>Podocarpus</i> (<i>P. cupressina</i>)<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> in fig. 48 B affords
    an instance of a conifer which simulates to some extent certain of the
    larger-leaved Liverworts; it bears a resemblance also to some fossil
    fragments referred to <i>Selaginellites</i> or <i>Lycopodites</i>.
    A small fossil specimen figured by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> from Japan as
    possibly a <i>Lycopodites</i> may be compared with a coniferous
    twig, and with some of the larger Liverworts, <i>e.g.</i> species of
    <i>Plagiochila</i><a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>. <i>Podocarpus cupressina</i> is, however,
    chiefly instructive as an example of the striking differences which are
    met with among species of the same genus; it differs considerably from
    the ordinary species of <i>Podocarpus</i>, and might well be identified
    as a member of some other group than that of the Coniferae.</p>

  <p>We have no records of Palaeozoic Hepaticae. The fossils which
    Zeiller has figured in his <cite>Flore de Brive</cite> as <i>Schizopteris
    dichotoma</i> Gümb.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> and <i>S. trichomanoides</i> Göpp. bear a
    resemblance to some forms of hepatics, but there is no satisfactory
    evidence for removing them from the position assigned to them by the
    French writer. In Mesozoic rocks a few specimens are known which
    bear a close resemblance as regards the form of the thalloid body to
    recent Liverworts, but the identification of such fossils cannot be
    absolutely trusted. Two French authors, MM. Fliche and Bleicher<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>,
    have described a plant from Lower Oolite rocks near Nancy as a species
    of <i>Marchantia</i>, <i>M. oolithus</i>, but they point out the close
    agreement of such forked laminar structures to algae and lichens. From
    Tertiary and Post-Tertiary beds a certain number of fossil species have
    been recorded, but they possess no special botanical interest.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

  <h4><span class="smcap">Order Marchantiales.</span></h4>

  <p>The plant-body is always thalloid, bearing rhizoids on the lower
    surface, and having an epidermis with pores limiting the upper or
    dorsal surface.</p>

  <h5 id="Marchantites"><i>Marchantites.</i></h5>

  <p>This convenient generic name was proposed by Brongniart in 1849<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>;
    it may be briefly defined as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Vegetative body of laminar form, with apparently dichotomous
      branches, and agreeing in habit with the recent thalloid Hepaticae,
      as represented by such a genus as <i>Marchantia</i>.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The name <i>Marchantites</i> is preferable to <i>Marchantia</i>, as the
    latter implies identity with the recent genus, whereas the former is
    used in a wide sense and refers rather to a definite form of vegetative
    body than to a particular generic type.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Marchantites erectus</i> (Leckenby). Fig. 49. This species may
    be described as follows: The thalloid body is divided into spreading
    dichotomously branched segments, obtusely pointed apically. The
    slightly wrinkled surface shows a distinct and comparatively broad
    darker and shorter median band, with lighter coloured and thinner
    margins.</p>

  <p>In 1864 Leckenby described this plant from the Lower Oolite beds of
    the Yorkshire coast near Scarborough, as <i>Fucoides erectus</i>,
    regarding it as a fossil alga. I recently pointed out <span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>that the general
    appearance and mode of occurrence of the specimens suggest a liverwort
    rather than an alga, and proposed the substitution of the genus
    <i>Marchantites</i><a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>. It would, however, be unwise to speak with
    any great confidence as to the real affinities of the fossil.</p>

  <p>The example shown in the figure is the type-specimen of Leckenby<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>:
    the breadth of the branches is about 3 mm. Under a low magnifying power
    the surface shows distinct and somewhat oblique wrinklings, the general
    appearance being very similar to that of some recent forms of the genus
    <i>Marchantia</i>.</p>

  <p>A closely allied species has recently been described from the
    Wealden beds of Ecclesbourne, near Hastings, on the Sussex coast, as
    <i>Marchantites Zeilleri</i> Sew.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>.</p>

  <p>In a recent monograph on Jurassic plants from Poland, apparently
    containing much that is of the greatest value, but which is
    unfortunately written in the Polish language, Raciborski<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> describes
    a new species of thalloid Liverwort under the name of <i>Paleohepatica
    Rostafinski</i>. The specimens are barren plants larger than any
    Jurassic species hitherto described; they agree closely in habit with
    Saporta’s Tertiary species <i>Marchantites Sezannensis</i>.</p>

  <p id="M_Sezannensis">2. <i>Marchantites Sezannensis Saporta.</i> Fig. 50. The body is
    broadly linear and dichotomously branched, with a somewhat undulating
    margin. Midrib on the dorsal surface depressed, but more prominent on
    the ventral surface. The upper surface is divided into hexagonal areas,
    in each of which occurs a central pore. There are two rows of scales
    along the median line on the lower surface. Stalked male receptacles.</p>

  <p>Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> first mentioned this fossil hepatic, which was found in
    the calcareous travertine of Sézanne of Oligocene age in the Province
    of Marne. The specimens figured by Saporta<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> show very clearly the
    characters of one of the <i>Marchantiaceae</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>and in this case we
    have the additional evidence of the characteristic male receptacles
    which are given off from a point towards the apex of the lobes, and
    arise from a slight median depression. In one of Saporta’s figures
    (reproduced in fig. 50 <i>A</i>) there are represented some median
    scars which may mark the position of cups similar to those which occur
    on recent species of <i>Marchantia</i>, and in which gemmæ or bulbils
    are produced.</p>

  <p>The collection of Sézanne fossils in the Sorbonne includes some very
    beautiful casts of <i>Marchantites</i> in which the structural details
    are preserved much more perfectly than in the examples described by
    Saporta. In a few specimens which Prof. Munier-Chalmas recently showed
    me the reproductive branches were exceedingly well shown. The fossils
    occur as moulds in the travertine, and the museum specimens are in the
    form of plaster-casts taken from the natural moulds.</p>

  <p>Several species of Liverworts belonging to the Marchantiales and
    Jungermanniales have been recorded from the amber of North Germany, of
    Oligocene age. These appear to be represented by small fragments, such

  <p>The plant-body (gametophyte) in the Musci consists of a stem bearing
    thin leaves, usually spirally disposed, rarely in two rows. The
    internal differentiation of the stem is generally well marked, and
    in some cases is comparable in complexity with the structure of the
    higher plants. A protonema arises from the spore, having the form of a
    branched filamentous, or more rarely a thalloid structure. Reproduction
    as in the group Bryophyta.</p>

  <p>Mosses like Liverworts have an extremely wide distribution, and occur
    in various habitats. In many districts vast tracts of country are
    practically monopolised by peat-forming genera, such as <i>Sphagnum</i>
    and other Mosses. Some genera are found on rocks at high altitudes
    in dry regions, a few grow as saprophytes, and many occur either as
    epiphytes on the leaves and stems of other plants, or carpeting the
    ground under the shade of forest trees.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">DETERMINATION OF MOSSES.</div>

  <p>In the simpler Mosses, the stem consists of a parenchymatous
    ground-tissue with a few outer layers of thicker-walled and smaller
    cells. In others there is a distinct central cylinder which occupies
    the axis of the stem, and consists of long and narrow cells; in
    the more complex forms the structure of the axial tissues suggests
    the central cylinder or <em>stele</em> of higher plants. The genus
    <i>Polytrichum</i>, so abundant on English moors, illustrates this
    higher type of stem differentiation. In a transverse section of the
    stem the peripheral tissue is seen to be composed of thick-walled
    cells, passing internally into large parenchymatous tissue. The
    axial part is occupied by a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>definite central cylinder consisting in
    the centre of elongated elements with dark-coloured and thick walls
    having thin transverse septa; surrounding this central tissue there
    are thinner walled elements, of which some closely agree in form
    with the sieve-tubes of the higher plants. The central tissue may be
    regarded as a rudimentary type of xylem, and the surrounding tissue as
    a rudimentary phloem. Each leaf is traversed by a median conducting
    strand which passes into the stem and eventually becomes connected with
    the axial cylinder.</p>

  <p>The fertilisation of the egg-cell gives rise to the development of a
    long slender stalk terminating distally in a large spore-capsule. In
    section the stalk or seta closely resembles the leafy axis of the moss
    plant. Considering the fairly close approach of some of the mosses to
    the higher plants as regards histological characters, it is conceivable
    that imperfectly petrified stems of fossil mosses might be mistaken for
    twigs of Vascular Cryptogams.</p>

  <p>Like Liverworts, Mosses have left very few traces of their existence in
    plant-bearing rocks. Without the aid of the characteristic moss-‘fruit’
    or sporogonium it is almost impossible to recognise fossil moss-plant
    fragments. In species of the tropical genera <i>Spiridens</i> and
    <i>Dawsonia</i>, e.g. <i>S. longifolius</i><a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Lind. or <i>D.
    superba</i><a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Grev. and <i>D. polytrichoides</i><a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> R. Br., the
    plant reaches a considerable length, and resembles twigs of plants
    higher in the scale than the Bryophytes. The finer branches of species
    of the extinct genus <i>Lepidodendron</i> are extremely moss-like
    in appearance. Again, <i>Cyathophyllum bulbosum</i> Muell<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>,
    with its two kinds of leaves arranged in rows, is not at all unlike
    species of <i>Selaginella</i> or the hepatic genus <i>Gottschea</i>.
    It is by no means improbable that some of the Palaeozoic specimens
    described as twigs of <i>Lycopodites</i>, <i>Selaginites</i>, or
    <i>Lepidodendron</i>, may be portions of mosses. The fertile branches
    of <i>Lycopodium phlegmaria</i> in a fossil condition might be easily
    mistaken for fragments of a moss. In some conifers with small and
    crowded scale-leaves there is a certain resemblance to the stouter
    forms of moss stems. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>Such possible sources of error should be
    prominently kept in view when we are considering the value of negative
    evidence as regards the geological history of the Musci.</p>

  <p>A recent writer<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> on mosses has expressed the opinion that no doubt
    the Musci played an exceedingly important rôle in past time. Although
    we have no proof that this was so, yet it is far from improbable, and
    the absence of fossil mosses must no doubt be attributed in part to
    their failure to be preserved in a fossil state.</p>

  <p>In the numerous samples of Coal-Measure vegetation preserved in
    extraordinary perfection in the calcareous nodules of England, no
    certain trace of a moss has so far been discovered. The most delicate
    tissue in the larger Palaeozoic plants has often been preserved, and
    in view of such possibilities of petrifaction it might appear strange
    that if moss-like plants existed no fragments had been preserved.
    Their absence is, however, no proof of the non-existence of Palaeozoic
    mosses, but it is a fact which certainly tends towards the assumption
    that mosses were probably not very abundant in the Coal Period forests.
    Epiphytic mosses frequently occur on the stems and leaves of ferns
    and other plants in tropical forests. Such small and comparatively
    delicate plants would, however, be easily rubbed off or destroyed in
    the process of fossilisation, and it is extremely rare to find among
    petrified Palaeozoic plants the external features well preserved. It is
    probable that the forests extended over low lying and swampy regions,
    and that, in part, the trees were rooted in a submerged surface. Under
    such conditions of growth there would not be the same abundance of
    Bryophytes as in most of our modern forests.</p>

  <p>To whatever cause the absence of mosses may be best attributed, it is
    a fact that should not be too strongly emphasised in discussions on
    plant-evolution.</p>

  <h5 id="Muscites"><i>Muscites.</i></h5>

  <p>This comprehensive genus may be defined as follows:—</p>

  <p>Stem filiform, simple or branched, bearing small sessile <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>leaves, with
    a delicate lamina, without veins or with a single median vein, arranged
    in a spiral manner on the stem.</p>

  <p><i>Muscites</i><a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> is one of those convenient generic designations
    which limited knowledge and incomplete data render necessary in
    palaeontology. Fossil plants which in their general habit bear a
    sufficiently striking resemblance to recent mosses, may be included
    under this generic name.</p>

  <p id="M_polytrichaceus">1. <i>Muscites polytrichaceus</i> Renault and Zeiller. In this species
    the stems are about 3–4 cm. long and 1·3 m. broad, usually simple,
    but sometimes giving off a few branches, and marked externally by
    very delicate longitudinal grooves. The leaves are alternate, closely
    arranged, lanceolate, with an acute apex, gradually narrowed towards
    the base, 1–2 mm. long, traversed by a single median vein.</p>

  <p>One of the French specimens, on which the species was founded<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>,
    is shown in fig. 51, and the form of the leaves is more clearly seen
    in the small enlarged piece of stem. The authors of the species point
    out that the tufted habit of the specimens, their small size, and the
    membranous character of the leaves, all point to the Musci as the
    Class to which the plant should be referred in spite of the absence of
    reproductive organs.</p>

  <p>Among recent mosses, the genus <i>Rhizogonium</i>,—one of the
    <i>Mniaceae</i>,—and <i>Polytrichum</i> are spoken of as offering a
    close <span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>resemblance to the fossil form. The type-specimen was found
    in the Coal-Measures of Commentry, and is now in the Museum of the

  <p>It has been suggested<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> that some small twigs figured by
    Lesquereux<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> from the Coal-Measures of North America as
    <i>Lycopodites Meeki</i> Lesq., may possibly be mosses. The specimens
    do not appear to be at all convincing, and cannot well be included
    as probable representatives of Palaeozoic Musci. <i>Lycopodites
    Meeki</i> Lesq. bears a close resemblance to the recent <i>Selaginella
    Oregana</i> shown in fig. 48, C.</p>

  <p>From Mesozoic rocks we have no absolutely trustworthy fossil mosses.
    The late Prof. Heer<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> has quoted the occurrence of certain fossil
    Caterpillars in Liassic beds as indicative of the existence of mosses,
    but evidence of this kind cannot be accepted as scientifically sound.
    In 1850 Buckman<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> described and figured a few fragments of plants
    from a freshwater limestone at the base of the Lias series near
    Bristol. Among others he described certain specimens as examples of
    a fossil Monocotyledon, under the generic name <i>Najadita</i>. Mr
    Starkie Gardner<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> subsequently examined the specimens, and suggested
    that the Lias fragments referred to <i>Najadita</i> should be compared
    with the recent freshwater moss <i>Fontinalis</i>. In this opinion he
    was supported by Mr Carruthers and Mr Murray of the British Museum.
    In a footnote to the memoir in which this suggestion is made, Gardner
    refers to a moss-capsule from the same beds, which he had received
    from Mr Brodie. Through the kindness of the latter gentleman, I have
    had an opportunity of examining the supposed capsule, and have no
    hesitation in describing it as absolutely indeterminable. It is in the
    form of an irregularly oval brown stain on the surface of the rock,
    with the suggestion of a stalk at one end, but there are no grounds for
    describing the specimen as a moss-capsule, or indeed anything else. The
    type-specimens figured by Brodie and subsequently referred to a moss
    are now in the British Museum; they are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>small and imperfect fragments
    of slender stems bearing rather long oval leaves which might well have
    belonged to a moss. The material is however too fragmentary to allow of
    accurate diagnosis or determination.</p>

  <p id="Muscites_ferrugineus">2. <i>Muscites ferrugineus</i> (Ludg.). This species possesses a
    slender stem bearing crowded ovate-acuminate leaves. The capsules
    are cup-shaped, borne on a short stalk, with a circular opening
    without marginal teeth. This fossil was first figured and described
    by Ludwig<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> from a brown ironstone of Miocene age at Dernbach
    in Nassau. The author of the species placed it in the recent genus
    <i>Gymnostomum</i>, and Schimper<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> afterwards changed the generic
    name to <i>Sphagnum</i>, at the same time altering the specific name
    to <i>Ludwigi</i>. The evidence is hardly strong enough to justify a
    generic designation which implies identity with a particular recent
    genus, and it is a much safer plan to adopt the non-committal term
    <i>Muscites</i>, at the same time retaining Ludwig’s original specific
    name. Without having examined the type-specimen it is impossible to
    express a definite opinion as to the accuracy of the description given
    by Ludwig; if the capsule is correctly identified it is the oldest
    example hitherto recorded of a fossil moss-sporogonium.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">PTERIDOPHYTA (Vascular Cryptogams).</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> Pteridophytes include plants which vary in size from a few
    millimetres<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> to several metres in height. The spore on germination
    gives rise to a small thalloid structure, the <em>prothallium</em>, on
    which the sexual organs are developed; this is the <em>gametophyte</em>
    or sexual generation. The sexual organs have the form of typical
    archegonia and antheridia. From the fertilised egg-cell there is
    developed the Pteridophyte plant or <em>sporophyte</em>, which bears
    the spores. This asexual generation shows a well-marked external
    differentiation into stem and leaves, and bears true roots. Internally
    the tissues exhibit a high degree of differentiation into distinct
    tissue-systems. True vascular bundles occur, which may or may not
    be capable of secondary thickening by means of a <em>cambium</em>,
    <i>i.e.</i> a definitely localised zone of meristematic tissue. The
    sporangia are borne either on the ordinary foliage leaves or on special
    spore-bearing leaves called <em>sporophylls</em>, which differ in a
    greater or less degree from the sterile leaves.</p>

  <p>The majority of the best known and most important Palaeozoic genera
    are either true Vascular Cryptogams, or possess certain of the
    pteridophytic characteristics combined with those of higher plants.
    It is not merely the commoner and more familiar recent genera with
    which the student of extinct types must be acquainted, but it is
    extremely important <span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>that he should make himself familiar with the
    rarer, less known and more isolated recent forms, which often throw
    most light on the affinities of the older representatives of the group.
    It is often the case, the more isolated living plants are, the more
    likely are they to afford valuable assistance in the interpretation
    of genera representing a class, which reached its maximum development
    in the earlier periods of the earth’s history. The importance of
    paying special attention to such recent plants as may be looked upon
    as survivals of a class now tending towards extinction, will be more
    thoroughly realised after the extinct vascular cryptogams have been
    dealt with.</p>

  <p>A comparison of the Pteridophyta and Bryophyta brings out certain
    points of divergence. In the first place, the sporophyte assumes in
    the former class a much more prominent rôle, and the gametophyte has
    suffered very considerable reduction. The gametophyte, <i>i.e.</i> the
    structure which is formed on the germination of the asexually-produced
    spore, is usually short-lived, small, and more or less dependent on
    the sporophyte for its nutrition. In a few cases only is it capable
    of providing itself with the essential elements of food. On the
    other hand, the sporophyte, at a very early stage of its development
    becomes free from the gametophyte and is entirely self-supporting.
    Reproduction is effected as in the Bryophyta by sexual reproductive
    organs and by asexual methods. Not only have we in the Pteridophytes a
    much more complete external division of the plant-body into definite
    members, which subserve distinct functions, and behave as well-defined
    physiological organs adapted for taking a certain share in the
    life-functions of the individual, but the internal differentiation has
    reached a much higher stage. True vascular tissue, consisting of xylem
    and phloem, occurs for the first time in this class. The whole plant is
    traversed by one or more vascular strands composed of xylem and phloem
    elements, which are respectively concerned with the distribution of
    inorganic and organic food substances.</p>

  <p>The Pteridophyta include the most important fossil plants. It is from a
    study of the internal structure of various extinct representatives of
    this class, that palaeobotanists have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> able to contribute facts
    of the greatest interest and importance towards the advancement of
    botanical science.</p>

  <p>The botanist’s chief aim in the anatomical investigation of Palaeozoic
    genera is to discover data which point the way to a solution of the
    problems of plant-evolution. In the abundant material afforded by the
    petrified remnants of ancient floras we have the means of tracing the
    past history of existing groups or individual forms, and it is from the
    Palaeozoic Pteridophytes that our most valuable results have been so
    far obtained.</p>

  <p>In this and the following chapters of Volume I. two divisions of
    the Pteridophyta are dealt with in such detail as the nature of the
    book allows. In the earlier chapters of Volume II. the remaining
    representatives of this class will be described. As in the preceding
    chapters such recent plants will be described as are most essential for
    the correct interpretation of the fossil forms.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to do more than confine our attention to a few
    only of the genera of living plants which directly concern us;
    some acquaintance with the general facts of plant morphology must
    be assumed. Among the most useful text-books or books of reference
    on the Pteridophyta the student may consult those mentioned in the
    footnote<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="EQUISETALES">I. EQUISETALES.</h3>

  <p>Leaves usually small in proportion to the size of the whole plant,
    arranged in whorls at the nodes. Sporangia borne on specially modified
    sporophylls or sporangiophores, which are aggregated to form a definite
    strobilus or spore-bearing cone.</p>

  <h5 id="Equisetaceae"><span class="smcap">Equisetaceae.</span> (Recent Species.)</h5>

  <p>The leaves are in whorls, coherent in the form of a sheath, and
    traversed by longitudinal veins which do not fork or anastomose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
    The stem is divided into comparatively long internodes separated by
    the leaf-bearing nodes, and the branches arise in the leaf-axils at
    the nodes. The fertile leaves or sporophylls differ from the sterile
    leaves, and usually occur in definite aggregations or strobili
    containing spores of one kind (<em>isosporous</em>). In the single living
    genus <i>Equisetum</i>, the outer coat of the mature spore forms two
    hygroscopically sensitive filamentous structures or <em>elaters</em>. On
    the germination of the spore the gametophyte is developed in the form
    of a small lobed prothallium 1–2 cm. in length. In most cases there are
    distinct male and female prothallia.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Equisetum</i> L., the common Horse-tail, is the sole
    living representative of this Family. It occurs as a common native
    plant in Britain, and has a wide geographical distribution. Species
    of <i>Equisetum</i> are abundant in the temperate zones of both
    hemispheres, and occur in arctic as well as tropical latitudes.
    Wallace<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> speaks of Horse-tails, “very like our own species,”
    growing at a height of 5000 feet on the Pangerango mountain in Java.
    In favourable situations the large British Horse-tail, <i>Equisetum
    maximum</i> Lam. (= <i>E. Telmateia</i> Erhb.), occasionally reaches a
    height of about six feet, and growing in thick clusters forms miniature
    forests of trees with slender erect stems and regular circles of long
    and thin branches. A tropical species, <i>Equisetum giganteum</i>
    Linn.[2] living in the marshes of Mexico and Cuba<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>, and extending
    southward to Buenos Ayres and Chili, reaches a height of twenty to
    forty feet, but the stem always remains slender, and does not exceed
    an inch in diameter. Groves of such tall slender plants on the eastern
    slopes of the Andes<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> suggest to the palaeobotanist an enfeebled
    forest-growth recalling the arborescent Calamites of a Palaeozoic
    vegetation. The twenty-five existing species of <i>Equisetum</i> are
    remnants of various generic types of former epochs, and possess a
    special interest from the point of view of the geological history of
    plants. A brief description of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>main characters of the recent
    genus will enable the student to appreciate the points of difference
    and agreement between the extinct and present representatives of the
    Equisetales.</p>

  <p>The plant consists of a perennial underground creeping rhizome,
    branching into secondary rhizomes, divided into well-marked nodes and
    internodes. From the nodes are given off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span> two sets of buds, which may
    develope into ascending aerial shoots or descending roots. At each node
    is a leaf-sheath more or less deeply divided along the upper margin

  <p>In some species one or more internodes of underground branches become
    considerably swollen and assume the form of ovate or elliptical
    starch-storing tubers, which are capable of giving rise to new plants
    by vegetative reproduction. Tubers, either singly or in chains,

    an internal longitudinal vascular strand. In the axil of each leaf,
    that is in the axil of each portion of a leaf-sheath corresponding to
    a marginal uni-nerved tooth, there is produced a lateral bud which may
    either remain dormant or break through the leaf-sheath and emerge as
    a lateral branch. At the base of each branch an adventitious root may
    be formed from a cell immediately below the first leaf-sheath, but
    in aerial shoots the roots usually remain undeveloped. The lateral
    branches repeat on a smaller scale the general features of the main
    axis. In some species, the shoots are unbranched, and in others the
    slender branches arise in crowded whorls from each node. Leaves, roots
    and branches are given off in whorls, and the whorls from each node
    alternate with those from the node next above and next below.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">ANATOMY OF EQUISETUM.</div>

  <p>In some species of <i>Equisetum</i> the aerial stem terminates in a
    conical group of sporophylls, while in others the strobilus is formed
    at the apex of a pale-coloured fertile shoot, which never attains
    any considerable length and dies down early in the season of growth
    (fig. 52, A). Below the terminal cone or strobilus there occur one
    or two modified leaf-sheaths. Such a ring of incompletely developed
    leaves intervening between the cone of sporangiophores and the normal
    leaves, is known as the <em>annulus</em>. The annulus is seen in fig.
    52, A, immediately below the lowest whorl of sporophylls; it has the
    form of a low sheath with a ragged margin. In the region of the cone
    the internodes remain shorter, and the whorls of appendages, known as
    sporophylls or sporangiophores, have the form of stalked structures
    terminating distally in a hexagonal peltate disc, which bears on its
    inner face a ring of five to ten oval sporangia (fig. 52, B). Each
    sporangium contains numerous spores which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span> eventually escape by the
    longitudinal dehiscence of the sporangial wall. The opening of the
    sporangia is probably assisted by the movements of the characteristic
    elaters formed from the outer wall of each spore.</p>

  <p>The spores, which are capable of living only a short time, grow into
    aerial green prothallia, 1–2 cm. in length; these have the form of
    irregularly and more or less deeply lobed structures. On the larger
    and more deeply lobed prothallia the archegonia or female reproductive
    organs are borne, and the smaller or male prothallia bear the
    antheridia. On the fertilisation of an egg-cell, the <i>Equisetum</i>
    plant is gradually developed. For a short time parasitic on the female
    prothallium or gametophyte, the young plant soon takes root in the
    ground and becomes completely independent.</p>

  <p>As seen in transverse section through a young stem near the apex, the
    axis consists of a mass of parenchyma, in which may be distinguished a
    central larger-celled tissue, surrounded by a ring of smaller-celled
    groups marking the position of a circle of embryonic vascular strands.
    In each young vascular strand, a few of the cells next the pith may
    be seen to have thicker walls and to be provided with a ring-like
    internal thickening; these have passed over into the condition of
    annular tracheids and represent the <em>protoxylem</em> elements. At a
    later stage, a transverse section through the stem shows a central
    hollow pith, formed by the tearing apart and subsequent disappearance
    of the medullary parenchymatous cells, which were unable to keep pace
    with the growth in thickness of the stem. The pith cavity is bridged
    across at each node by a multi-layered plate of parenchyma, which forms
    the so-called nodal <em>diaphragm</em>. The inner edge of each vascular
    strand is now found to be occupied by a small irregularly circular
    canal (fig. 52, C, c, and D, c) in which may be seen some of the rings
    of protoxylem tracheids (D, a) which have been torn apart and almost
    completely destroyed. These canals, known as <em>carinal canals</em>,
    have arisen by the tearing and disruption of the thin-walled cells in
    the immediate neighbourhood of the protoxylem. Each carinal canal is
    bounded by a layer of elongated parenchymatous cells which form part
    of the xylem of the vascular bundle, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> succeeded internally by
    the general ground-tissue of the stem. The xylem parenchyma next a
    carinal canal is succeeded externally by phloem tissue, consisting
    of short protoplasmic cells and longer elements, without nuclei and
    poor in contents; the latter may be regarded as sieve-tubes. On either
    side of the phloem, the xylem occurs in two separate bands or groups
    of annular and reticulately thickened tracheids. In some species,
    <i>e.g.</i> <i>Equisetum xylochaetum</i> Metten.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> and <i>E.
    giganteum</i><a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> L. a native of South America, the xylem has the
    form of two bands composed of fairly numerous tracheids, but in most
    species the xylem tracheids occur in small groups, as shown in the
    figure of <i>E. maximum</i> (fig. 52, D). In the shape of the vascular
    bundle, and in the formation of the carinal canal, there is a distinct
    resemblance between the vascular bundles of <i>Equisetum</i> and those
    of a monocotyledonous stem. These collateral stem-bundles of xylem and
    phloem traverse each internode as distinct strands, and at the nodes
    each strand forks into two branches (fig. 54, A), which anastomose with
    the alternating bundles passing into the stem from the leaf-sheath.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>Thus the vascular strands of each internode alternate in position with
    those of the next internode.</p>

  <p>There are certain points connected with the vascular bundles in the
    nodal region of a shoot, which have an important bearing on the
    structure of fossil equisetaceous stems. Fig. 54 B represents a
    diagrammatic longitudinal section through the node of a rhizome of
    <i>Equisetum arvense</i> from which a root <i>h</i> is passing off in a
    downward direction, and a branch in an upward direction. The black band
    <i>c</i> in the parent stem shows the position of the vascular strands;
    in the region of the node the vascular tissue attains a considerable
    thickness, as seen at <i>d</i> in the figure. The bands passing out to
    the left from <i>d</i> go to supply the branch and root respectively.
    The increased breadth of the xylem strands at the node is due to the
    intercalation of a number of short tracheids. Fig. 55, 4 shows a
    transverse section through a mature node of <i>Equisetum maximum</i>;
    <i>px</i> marks the position of the protoxylem and <i>e</i> that of
    the endodermis. On comparing this section with that of the internodal
    vascular bundle in fig. 52, D, the much greater development of wood
    in the former is obvious; the carinal canal of the internodal bundle
    is absent in the section through a node. The disposition of the xylem
    tracheids in fig. 55, 4 shows a certain regularity which, though not
    very well marked, suggests the development of wood elements as the
    result of cambial activity. Longitudinal sections through the nodal
    region demonstrate the existence of “cells similar to those of an
    ordinary cambium, and a cell-formation resulting from their division
    which is similar to that in an ordinary secondary thickening.”<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
    The short tracheids which make up this nodal mass of xylem differ from
    those in the internodal bundle in their smaller size, and in being
    reticulately thickened. There is, therefore, evidence that in the nodes
    of some <i>Equisetum</i> stems additional xylem elements are produced
    by a method of growth comparable with the cambial activity which brings
    about the growth in thickness of a forest-tree<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>significance
    of these statements will be realised when the structure of the
    extinct genus <i>Calamites</i> is described and compared with that of
    <i>Equisetum</i>.</p>

  <p>The small drawing in fig. 55, 3 shows part of the ring of thick nodal
    wood; the section cuts through two bundles about their point of
    bifurcation, the strand <i>x</i> is passing out in a radial direction
    to a lateral branch, the strand to the right of <i>x</i> and the
    separate fragment of a strand to the left of <i>x</i> are portions of
    leaf-trace bundles on their way to the leaf-sheath. Reverting to fig.
    54, B, the other structures seen in the section are the leaf-sheaths
    (<i>l</i> and <i>m</i>), the vallecular canal (<i>f</i>), the
    epidermis, cortex and pith (<i>k</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>a</i>) of the
    stem. The epidermis which has been ruptured by the root and branch is
    indicated at <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>; the dotted lines traversing the upper
    part of the pith of the lateral branch mark the position of a nodal
    diaphragm.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Immediately external to each vascular strand, as seen in transverse
    section, there is a layer of cells containing starch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span> and this
    is followed by a distinct endodermis, of which the cells show the
    characteristic black dot in the cuticularised radial walls (fig. 52,
    D). Beyond the endodermis there is the large-celled parenchyma of
    the rest of the cortex. Tannin cells occur here and there scattered
    among the ground tissue. On the same radius on which each vascular
    strand occurs, the cortical parenchyma passes into a mass of
    sub-epidermal thick-walled mechanical tissue or stereome. Alternating
    with the ridges of stereome, the grooves are occupied by thin-walled
    chlorophyll-containing tissue which carries on most of the assimilating
    functions, and communicates with the external atmosphere by means of
    stomata arranged in vertical rows down each internode. The continuity
    of the cortical tissue is interrupted by the occurrence of large
    longitudinal <em>vallecular canals</em> alternating in position with the
    stem ridges and vascular strands (fig. 52, C, <i>v</i>). The epidermis
    consists of a single layer of cells, containing stomata, and with the
    outer cell-walls impregnated with silica.</p>

  <p>In certain species of <i>Equisetum</i>, <i>e.g.</i> <i>E. palustre</i>
    L., the whole circle of vascular strands is enclosed by an endodermis,
    and has the structure typical of a monostelic stem. In others
    <i>e.g.</i> <i>E. litorale</i> Kühl. each vascular strand is surrounded
    by a separate endodermis, and in some forms <i>e.g.</i> <i>E.
    sylvaticum</i> L. there is an inner as well as an outer endodermal
    layer<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>. Without discussing the explanation given to this variation
    in the occurrence of the endodermis, it may be stated that in all
    species of <i>Equisetum</i> the stem may be regarded as monostelic<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>.</p>

  <p>In the rhizome the structure agrees in the main with that of the
    green shoots, but the vallecular canals attain a larger size, and the
    pith is solid. A slightly enlarged transverse section of a rhizome of
    <i>Equisetum maximum</i> is shown in fig. 55, 2, the small circles
    surrounding the pith mark the position of the vascular bundles and
    carinal canals; the much larger spaces between the central cylinder and
    the surface of the stem are the vallecular canals.</p>

  <p>The central cylinder or stele of the root is of the diarch, triarch or
    tetrarch type; <i>i.e.</i> there may be 2, 3 or 4 groups of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>protoxylem
    in the xylem of the root stele. The axial portion is occupied by large
    tracheids, and the smaller tracheids of the xylem occur as radially
    disposed groups, alternating with groups of phloem. External to the
    xylem and phloem strands there occur two layers of cells, usually
    spoken of as a double endodermis, but it has been suggested that it is
    preferable to describe the double layer as the <em>phloeoterma</em><a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>,
    of which the inner layer has the functions of a pericycle, and the
    outer that of an endodermis. A transverse section of a root is seen
    in fig. 55, 1, the dark cells on the left are part of a thick band of
    sclerenchyma in the cortex of the root, the layer e is the outer layer
    of the phloeoterma.</p>

  <p>Without describing in detail the development<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> of the sporangia,
    it should be noted that the sporangial wall is at first 3 to 4 cells
    thick, but it eventually consists of a single layer. The cells have
    spiral thickening bands on the ventral surface, and rings on the
    cells where the longitudinal splitting takes place. Each sporangium
    is supplied by a vascular bundle which is given off from that of the
    sporangiophore axis. The strobili are isosporous.</p>

  <p>In dealing with the fossil Equisetales, we will first consider the
    genera <i>Equisetites</i>, <i>Phyllotheca</i> and <i>Schizoneura</i>,
    and afterwards describe the older and better known genera
    <i>Calamites</i> and <i>Archaeocalamites</i>. A thoroughly satisfactory
    classification of the members of the Equisetales is practically
    impossible without more data than we at present possess. It has
    been the custom to include <i>Equisetites</i>, <i>Phyllotheca</i>
    and <i>Schizoneura</i> in the family Equisetaceae, and to refer
    <i>Calamites</i> and <i>Archaeocalamites</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> to the Calamarieae;
    such a division rests in part on assumption, and cannot be considered
    final. When we attempt to define the Equisetales and the two families
    Equisetaceae and Calamarieae, we find ourselves seriously hampered
    by lack of knowledge of certain important characters, which should
    be taken into account in framing diagnoses. There is little harm in
    retaining provisionally the two families already referred to, if we do
    not allow a purely arbitrary classification to prejudice our opinions
    as to the affinities of the several members of the Equisetales.</p>

  <p>The Equisetaceae might be defined as a family including plants which
    were usually herbaceous but in some cases arborescent, bearing
    verticils of leaves in the form of sheaths more or less deeply divided
    into segments or teeth. The strobili were isosporous and consisted of
    a central axis bearing verticils of distally expanded sporophylls with
    sporangia, as in <i>Equisetum</i>. The genus <i>Equisetites</i> might
    be included in this family, but it must be admitted that we know next
    to nothing as to its anatomy, and we cannot be sure that the strobili
    were always isosporous.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Schizoneura</i> is too imperfectly known to be defined
    with any approach to completeness, or to be assigned to a family
    defined within certain prescribed limits. <i>Phyllotheca</i> is another
    genus about which we possess but little satisfactory knowledge; we
    are still without evidence as to its structure, and the descriptions
    of the few strobili that are known are not consistent. Recent work
    points to a probability of <i>Phyllotheca</i> being closely allied to
    <i>Annularia</i>, a genus included in the Calamarieae, and standing for
    a certain type of Calamitean foliage-shoots.</p>

  <p>In comparing the Calamarieae with the Equisetaceae, the alternation of
    sterile and fertile whorls in the strobilus, and the free linear leaves
    at the nodes instead of leaf-sheaths are two characters made use of as
    distinguishing features of the genus <i>Calamites</i> as the type of
    the Calamarieae. On the other hand, the strobili of <i>Phyllotheca</i>
    appear to agree with those of <i>Calamites</i> rather than with
    those of <i>Equisetum</i>, and strobili of <i>Archaeocalamites</i>
    have been found exhibiting the typical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span> <i>Equisetum</i> characters.
    The sheath-like form of the leaves is not necessarily peculiar to
    the Equisetaceae, and we have evidence that leaf-sheaths occurred
    on the nodes of Calamitean plants. In <i>Archaeocalamites</i> the
    leaves possess characteristic features, and can hardly be said to
    agree more closely with those of Calamites than with the leaves of
    <i>Phyllotheca</i> or <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, a genus belonging to
    another class of Pteridophytes.</p>

  <p>On the whole, then, without discussing further the possibilities
    of a subdivision of the Equisetales, we may regard the genera
    <i>Calamites</i>, <i>Archaeocalamites</i>, <i>Equisetites</i>,
    <i>Equisetum</i>, <i>Phyllotheca</i> and <i>Schizoneura</i> as so many
    members of the Equisetales, without insisting on a classification which
    cannot be supported by satisfactory evidence.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of <i>Calamites</i> is fairly complete. Abundant and
    well-preserved material from the Coal-Measures of England, and from
    Permo-Carboniferous rocks of France, Germany and elsewhere, has
    enabled palaeobotanists to investigate the anatomical characters of
    both the vegetative and reproductive structures of this genus. We are
    in a position to give a detailed diagnosis of Calamitean stems, roots
    and strobili, and to determine the place of this type of plant in a
    system of classification. <i>Calamites</i> not only illustrates the
    possibilities of palaeobotanical research, but it demonstrates the
    importance of fossil forms as foundations on which to construct the
    most rational classification of existing plants. The close alliance
    between <i>Calamites</i> and the recent Equisetaceae has been clearly
    established, and certain characteristics of the former genus render
    necessary an extension and modification of the definition of the class
    to which both <i>Calamites</i> and <i>Equisetites</i> belong. The
    Calamites broaden our conception of the Equisetaceous alliance, and by
    their resemblance to other extinct Palaeozoic types they furnish us
    with important links towards a phylogenetic series, which the other
    members of the Equisetales do not supply.</p>

  <p>From the Upper Devonian to the Permian epoch <i>Calamites</i> and other
    closely related types played a prominent part in the vegetation of the
    world. We have no good evidence for the existence of <i>Calamites</i>
    in Triassic times; in its place there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span> gigantic Equisetums which
    resembled modern Horse-tails in a remarkable degree. In the succeeding
    Jurassic period tree-like Equisetums were still in existence, and
    species of <i>Equisetites</i> are met with in rocks of this age in
    nearly all parts of the world. A few widely distributed species are
    known from Wealden rocks, but as we ascend the geologic series from the
    Jurassic strata, the Equisetums become less numerous and the individual
    plants gradually assume proportions practically identical with those of
    existing forms.</p>

  <h6 id="Equisetites">A. <i>Equisetites.</i></h6>

  <p>The generic name <i>Equisetites</i> was proposed by Sternberg in
    1838<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> as a convenient designation for fossil stems bearing a close
    resemblance to recent species of <i>Equisetum</i>. Some authors have
    preferred to apply the name <i>Equisetum</i> to fossil and recent
    species alike, but in spite of the apparent identity in the external
    characters of the fossil stems with those of existing Horse-tails, and
    a close similarity as regards the cones, there are certain reasons
    for retaining Sternberg’s generic name. It is important to avoid such
    nomenclature as might appear to express more than the facts admit. If
    the custom of adding the termination -<em>ites</em> to the root of a
    recent generic term is generally followed, it at once serves to show
    that the plants so named are fossil and not recent species. Moreover,
    in the case of fossil Equisetums we know nothing of their internal
    structure, and our comparisons are limited to external characters.
    Stems, cones, tubers, and leaves are often very well preserved as
    sandstone casts with distinct surface-markings, but we are still in
    want of petrified specimens. There is indeed evidence that some of the
    Triassic and Jurassic species of <i>Equisetites</i>, like the older
    Calamites, possessed the power of secondary growth in thickness, but
    our deductions are based solely on external characters.</p>

  <p>In the following pages a few of the better known species of
    <i>Equisetites</i> are briefly described, the examples being chosen
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>partly with a view to illustrate the geological history of the
    genus, and partly to contribute something towards a fuller knowledge
    of particular species. One of the most striking facts to be gleaned
    from a general survey of the past history of the Equisetaceae is the
    persistence since the latter part of the Palaeozoic period of that
    type of plant which is represented by existing Equisetums. There
    is perhaps no genus in existence which illustrates more vividly
    than <i>Equisetum</i> the survival of an extremely ancient group,
    which is represented to-day by numerous and widely spread species.
    The Equisetaceous characteristics mark an isolated division of
    existing Vascular Cryptogams, and without reference to extinct types
    it is practically impossible to do more than vaguely guess at the
    genealogical connections of the family. When we go back to Palaeozoic
    plants there are indications of guiding lines which point the way to
    connecting branches between the older Equisetales and other classes of
    Pteridophytes. The recently discovered genus <i>Cheirostrobus</i><a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
    is especially important from this point of view.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">LEAF-SHEATHS OF EQUISETITES.</div>

  <p>The accurate description of species, and the determination of the value
    of such differences as are exhibited in the surface characters of
    structureless casts, are practically impossible in many of the fossil
    forms. In certain living Horse-tails we find striking differences
    between fertile and sterile shoots, and between branches of different
    orders. The isolated occurrence of fragments of fossil stems often
    leads to an artificial separation of ‘species’ largely founded on
    differences in diameter, or on slight variations in the form of the
    leaf-sheaths. It is wiser to admit that in many cases we are without
    the means of accurate diagnosis, and that the specific names applied
    to fossil Equisetums do not always possess much value as criteria of
    taxonomic differences.</p>

  <p>The specimens of fossil Equisetums are usually readily recognised by
    the coherent leaf-segments in the form of nodal sheaths resembling
    those of recent species. The tissues of the cortex and central
    cylinder are occasionally represented by a thin layer <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>of coal pressed
    on to the surface of a sandstone cast, or covering a flattened
    stem-impression on a piece of shale. It is sometimes possible under
    the microscope to recognise on the carbonised epidermal tissues
    the remains of a surface-ornamentation similar to that in recent
    species, which is due to the occurrence of siliceous patches on the
    superficial cells. Longitudinal rows of stomata may also be detected
    under favourable conditions of preservation. The nodal diaphragms
    of stems have occasionally been preserved apart, but such circular
    and radially-striated bodies may be misleading if found as isolated
    objects. Casts of the wide hollow pith of <i>Equisetites</i>, with
    longitudinal ridges and grooves, and fairly deep nodal constrictions,
    have often been mistaken for the medullary casts of <i>Calamites</i>.</p>

  <p>Several species of <i>Equisetites</i> have been recorded from the
    Upper Coal-Measures and overlying Permian rocks, but these present
    special difficulties. In one instance described below, (<i>Equisetites
    Hemingwayi</i> Kidst.), the species was founded on a cast of what
    appeared to be a strobilus made up of sporophylls similar to those in
    an <i>Equisetum</i> cone. In other Permo-Carboniferous species the
    choice of the generic name <i>Equisetites</i> has been determined
    by the occurrence of leaf-sheaths either isolated or attached to
    the node of a stem. The question to consider is, how far may the
    Equisetum-like leaf-sheath be regarded as a characteristic feature of
    <i>Equisetites</i> as distinct from <i>Calamites</i>? In the genus
    <i>Calamites</i> the leaves are generally described as simple linear
    leaves arranged in a whorl at the nodes, but not coherent in the form
    of a sheath (fig. 85). The fusion of the segments into a continuous
    sheath or collar is regarded as a distinguishing characteristic of
    <i>Equisetites</i> and <i>Equisetum</i>. The typical leaf-sheath
    of a recent Horse-tail has already been described. In some species
    we have fairly large and persistent free teeth on the upper margin
    of the leaf-sheath, but in other Equisetums the rim of the sheath
    is practically straight and has a truncated appearance, the distal
    ends of the segments being separated from one another by very
    slight depressions, as in a portion of the sheath of <i>Equisetum
    ramosissimum</i> Desf. of fig. 58, <i>C</i>. In other leaf-sheaths of
    this species there are delicate and pointed teeth adherent to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
    margin of the coherent segments; the teeth are deciduous, and after
    they have fallen the sheath presents a truncated appearance. This
    difference between the sheaths to which the teeth are still attached
    and those from which they have fallen is illustrated by fig. 58,
    <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>; it is one which should be borne in mind in the
    description of fossil species, and has probably been responsible for
    erroneous specific diagnoses. In some recent Horse-tails the sheath
    is occasionally divided in one or two places by a slit reaching to
    the base of the coherent segments<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>; this shows a tendency of
    the segments towards the free manner of occurrence which is usually
    considered a Calamitean character. In certain fossils referred to
    the genus <i>Annularia</i>, the nodes bear whorls of long and narrow
    leaves which are fused basally into a collar (fig. 58, <i>D</i>).
    There are good grounds for believing that at least some Annularias
    were the foliage shoots of true Calamites. Again, in some species of
    <i>Calamitina</i>, a sub-genus of <i>Calamites</i>, the leaves appear
    to have been united basally into a narrow sheath. We see, then, that
    it is a mistake to attach great importance to the separate or coherent
    character of leaf-segments in attempting to draw a line between the
    true <i>Calamites</i> and <i>Equisetites</i>. Potonié<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>while
    pointing out that this distinction does not possess much value as a
    generic character, retains the genus <i>Equisetites</i> for certain
    Palaeozoic Equisetum-like leaf-sheaths.</p>

  <p>Fig. 56 represents a rather faint impression of a leaf-sheath and
    nodal diaphragm. The specimen is from the Coal-Measures of Ardwick,
    Manchester. The letter <i>a</i> probably points to the attachment
    of the sheath to the node of the stem. The flattened sheath is
    indistinctly divided into segments, and at the middle of the free
    margin there appears to be a single free tooth. The lower part of
    the specimen, as seen in the figure, shows the position of the nodal
    diaphragm. Between the diaphragm and the sheath there are several
    slight ridges converging towards the nodal line; these agree with the
    characteristic ridges and grooves of Calamite casts which are described
    in detail in Chapter X. There is another specimen in the British Museum
    which illustrates, rather more clearly than that shown in fig. 56, the
    association of a fused leaf-sheath with a type of cast usually regarded
    as belonging to a Calamitean stem. Some leaf-sheaths of Permian age
    described by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> as <i>Equisetites Vaujolyi</i> bear a close
    resemblance to the sheath in fig. 58 E. The nature of the true Calamite
    leaves is considered more fully on a later page.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PALAEOZOIC EQUISETITES.</div>

  <p>The examples of supposed <i>Equisetites</i> sheaths referred to below
    may serve to illustrate the kind of evidence on which this genus
    has been recorded from Upper Palaeozoic rocks. I have retained the
    name <i>Equisetites</i> in the description of the species, but it
    would probably be better to speak of such specimens as ‘Calamitean
    leaf-sheaths’ rather than to describe them as definite species of
    <i>Equisetites</i>. We have not as yet any thoroughly satisfactory
    evidence that the <i>Equisetites</i> of Triassic and post-Triassic
    times existed in the vegetation of earlier periods.</p>

  <p>In Grand’Eury’s <cite>Flore du Gard</cite><a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> a fossil strobilus is
    figured under the name <i>Calamostachys tenuissima</i> Grand’Eury,
    which consists of a slender axis bearing series of sporophylls and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>sporangia apparently resembling those of an <i>Equisetum</i>.
    There are no sterile appendages or bracts alternating with the
    sporophylls; and the absence of the former suggests a comparison with
    <i>Equisetites</i> rather than <i>Calamites</i>. Grand’Eury refers to
    the fossil as “parfois à peine perceptible,” and a recent examination
    of the specimen leads me to thoroughly endorse this description. It
    was impossible to recognise the features represented in Grand’Eury’s
    drawing. Setting aside this fossil, there are other strobili recorded
    by Renault<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> and referred by him to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>genus <i>Bornia</i>
    (<i>Archaeocalamites</i>), which also exhibit the Equisetum-like
    character; the axis bears sporophylls only and no sterile bracts. It
    would appear then that in the Palaeozoic period the Equisetaceous
    strobilus, as we know it in <i>Equisetum</i>, was represented in some
    of the members of the Equisetales.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="Equisetites_Hemingwayi">1. <i>Equisetites Hemingwayi</i> Kidst. Fig. 57, <i>A</i>.</div>

  <p>Mr Kidston<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> founded this species on a few specimens of cones
    found in the Middle Coal-Measures of Barnsley in Yorkshire. The best
    example of the cone described by Kidston has a length of 2·5 cm.,
    and a breadth of 1·5 cm.; the surface is divided up into several
    hexagonal areas 4 mm. high and 5 mm. wide. Each of these plates shows
    a fairly prominent projecting point in its centre; this is regarded
    as the point of attachment of the sporangiophore axis which expanded
    distally into a hexagonal plate bearing sporangia. An examination of
    Mr Kidston’s specimens enabled me to recognise the close resemblance
    which he insists on between the fossils and such a recent Equisetaceous
    strobilus as that of <i>Equisetum limosum</i> Sm. Nothing is known of
    the structure of the fossils beyond the character of the superficial
    pattern of the impressions, and it is impossible to speak with absolute
    confidence as to their nature. The author of the species makes use
    of the generic name <i>Equisetum</i>; but in view of our ignorance
    of structural features it is better to adopt the more usual term
    <i>Equisetites</i>.</p>

  <p>Since Kidston’s description was published I noticed a specimen in the
    British Museum collection which throws some further light on this
    doubtful fossil. Part of this specimen is shown in fig. 57, <i>A</i>.
    The stem is 21 cm. in length and about 5 mm. broad; it is divided into
    distinct nodes and internodes; the former being a little exaggerated in
    the drawing. The surface is marked by fine and irregular striations,
    and in one or two places there occur broken pieces of narrow linear
    leaves in the neighbourhood of a node. Portions of four cones occurring
    in contact with the stem, appear to be sessile on the nodes, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>but the
    preservation is not sufficiently good to enable one to speak with
    certainty as to the manner of attachment. Each cone consists of regular
    hexagonal depressions, which agree exactly with the surface characters
    of Kidston’s type-specimen. The manner of occurrence of the cones
    points to a lateral and not a terminal attachment. The stem does not
    show any traces of Equisetaceous leaf-sheaths at the nodes, and such
    fragments of leaves as occur appear to have the form of separate linear
    segments; they are not such as are met with on <i>Equisetites</i>. It
    agrees with some of the slender foliage-shoots of Calamitean plants
    often described under the generic name <i>Asterophyllites</i>. As
    regards the cones; they differ from the known Calamitean strobili
    in the absence of sterile bracts, and appear to consist entirely of
    distally expanded sporophylls as in <i>Equisetum</i>. The general
    impression afforded by the fossil is that we have not sufficient
    evidence for definitely associating this stem and cones with a true
    <i>Equisetites</i>. We may, however, adhere to this generic title until
    more satisfactory data are available.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="E_spatulatus">2. <i>Equisetites spatulatus</i> Zeill. Fig. 58, <i>A</i>.</div>

  <p>This species is chosen as an example of a French <i>Equisetites</i> of
    Permian age. It was recently founded by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> on some specimens
    of imperfect leaf-sheaths, and defined as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Sheaths spreading, erect, formed of numerous uninerved coherent
      leaves, convex on the dorsal surface, spatulate in form, 5–6 cm.
      in length and 2–3 mm. broad at the base, and 5–10 mm. broad at the
      apex, rounded at the distal end.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The specimen shown in fig. 58, <i>A</i>, represents part of a flattened
    sheath, the narrower crenulated end being the base of the sheath.
    The limits of the coherent segments and the position of the veins
    are clearly marked. Zeiller’s description accurately represents the
    character of the sheaths. They agree closely with an Equisetaceous
    leaf-sheath, but as I have already pointed out, we cannot feel certain
    that sheaths of this kind were not originally attached to a Calamite
    stem.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

  <p>The portion of a leaf-sheath and a diaphragm represented in fig. 57,
    <i>B</i>, agrees closely with Zeiller’s examples. This specimen is from
    the English Coal-Measures, but it is not advisable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> attempt any
    specific diagnosis on such fragmentary material. It is questionable,
    indeed, if these detached fossil leaf-sheaths should be designated by
    specific names. Another similar form of sheath, hardly distinguishable
    from Zeiller’s species, has recently been described by Potonié from the
    Permian (Rothliegende) of Thuringia.</p>

  <p>The sheaths consist of linear segments fused laterally as in
    <i>Equisetum</i>. In some specimens the component parts of the
    sheath are more or less separate from one another, and in this form
    they are apparently identical with the leaves of <i>Calamites</i>
    (<i>Calamitina</i>) <i>varians</i>, Sternb. The example shown in fig.
    58, <i>E</i> is probably a young leaf-sheath; the segments are fused,
    and each is traversed by a single vein represented by a dark line in
    the figure. The regular crenulated lower margin is the base of the
    sheath, and corresponds to the upper portion of fig. 58, <i>A</i>.
    This species affords, therefore, an interesting illustration of the
    difficulty of separating <i>Equisetites</i> leaves from those of true
    <i>Calamites</i>. Potonié has suggested that the leaf-sheath of a young
    Calamite might well be split up into distinct linear segments as the
    result of the increase in girth of the stem.</p>

  <p>Other Palaeozoic species of <i>Equisetites</i> have been recorded,
    but with one exception these need not be dealt with, as they do not
    add anything to our knowledge of botanical importance. The specimen
    described in the <cite>Flore de Commentry</cite> as <i>Equisetites Monyi</i>,
    by Renault and Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>, differs from most of the other Palaeozoic
    species of <i>Equisetites</i>, in the fact that we have a stem with
    short internodes bearing a leaf-sheath at each node divided into
    comparatively long and distinct teeth. This species presents a close
    agreement with specimens of <i>Calamitina</i>, but Renault and Zeiller
    consider that it is generically distinct. They suggest that the
    English species, originally <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>described and figured by Lindley and
    Hutton<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> as <i>Hippurites gigantea</i>, and now usually spoken of
    as <i>Calamitina</i>, should be named <i>Equisetites</i>. It would
    probably be better to adopt the name <i>Calamitina</i> for the French
    species. The type-specimen of this species is in the Natural History
    Museum, Paris.</p>

  <p>When we pass from the Permian to the Triassic period, we find large
    casts of very modern-looking Equisetaceous stems which must clearly
    be referred to the genus <i>Equisetites</i>. The portion of a
    stem represented in fig. 59 known as <i>Equisetites platyodon</i>
    Brongn.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> affords an example of a Triassic Equisetaceous stem with
    a clearly preserved leaf-sheath. The stem measures about 6 cm. in
    diameter. One of the oldest known Triassic species is <i>Equisetites
    Mougeoti</i><a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> (Brongn.) from the Bunter series of the Vosges.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

  <p>The Keuper species <i>E. arenaceus</i> is, however, more completely
    known. The specimens referred to this species are very striking
    fossils; they agree in all external characters with recent Horse-tails
    but greatly exceed them in dimensions.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="E_arenaceus">4. <i>Equisetites arenaceus</i> Bronn.</div>

  <p>This plant has been found in the Triassic rocks of various parts of
    Germany and France; it occurs in the Lettenkohl group (Lower Keuper),
    as well as in the Middle Keuper of Stuttgart and elsewhere. The species
    may be defined as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Rhizome from 8–14 cm. in diameter, with short internodes,
      bearing lateral ovate tubers. Aerial shoots from 4–12 cm. in
      diameter, bearing whorls of branches, and leaf-sheaths made up
      of 110–120 coherent uni-nerved linear segments terminating in an
      apical lanceolate tooth. Strobili oval, consisting of crowded
      sporangiophores with pentagonal and hexagonal peltate terminations.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The casts of branches, rhizomes, tubers, buds and cones enable us to
    form a fairly exact estimate of the size and general appearance of
    this largest fossil Horse-tail. The Strassburg Museum contains many
    good examples of this species, and a few specimens may be seen in
    the British Museum. In the École des Mines, Paris, there are some
    exceptionally clear impressions of cones of this species from a lignite
    mine in the Vosges.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that the plant reached a height of 8 to 10 meters,
    about equal to that of the tallest recent species of <i>Equisetum</i>,
    but in the diameter of the stems the Triassic plant far exceeded any
    existing species.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to determine as far as possible, in the absence
    of petrified specimens, if this Keuper species increased in girth
    by means of a cambium. There are occasionally found sandstone
    casts of the pith-cavity which present an appearance very similar
    to that of Calamitean medullary casts<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>nodes are marked
    by comparatively deep constrictions, which probably represent the
    projecting nodal wood. The surface of the casts is traversed by regular
    ridges and grooves as in an ordinary Calamite, and it is probable
    that in <i>Equisetites arenaceus</i>, as in <i>Calamites</i>, these
    surface-features are the impression of the inner face of a cylinder of
    secondary wood (<i>cf.</i> p. 310). Excellent figures of this species
    of <i>Equisetites</i> are given by Schimper in his Atlas of fossil
    plants<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>, also by Schimper and Koechlin-Schlumberger<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>, and by

  <div class="h7" id="E_columnaris">5. <i>Equisetites columnaris</i> Brongn. Figs. 11 and 58, <i>B</i>.</div>

  <p>This species, which is by far the best known British
    <i>Equisetites</i>, was founded by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> on some specimens
    from the Lower Oolite beds of the Yorkshire coast. Casts of stems are
    familiar to those who have collected fossils on the coast between
    Whitby and Scarborough; they are often found in an erect position in
    the sandstone, and are usually described as occurring in the actual
    place of growth. As previously pointed out (p. 72), such stems have
    generally been deposited by water, and have assumed a vertical position
    (fig. 11). Young and Bird<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> figured a specimen of this species
    in 1822, and in view of its striking resemblance to the sugar-cane,
    they regarded the fossil as being of the same family as <i>Saccharum
    officinarum</i>, if not specifically identical.</p>

  <p>A specimen was described by König<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> in 1829, from the Lower
    Oolite rocks of Brora in the north of Scotland under the name of
    <i>Oncylogonatum carbonarium</i>, but Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> pointed out its
    identity with the English species <i>Equisetites columnaris</i>.</p>

  <p>Our acquaintance with this species is practically limited to the
    casts of stems. A typical stem of <i>E. columnaris</i> measures 3 to
    6 cm. in diameter and has fairly long internodes. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>largest stem
    in the British Museum collection has internodes about 14 cm. long and
    a diameter of about 5 cm. In some cases the stem casts show irregular
    lateral projections in the neighbourhood of a node, but there is no
    evidence that the aerial shoots of this species gave off verticils of
    branches. In habit <i>E. columnaris</i> probably closely resembled such
    recent species as <i>Equisetum hiemale</i> L., <i>E. trachyodon</i> A.
    Br. and others.</p>

  <p>The stems often show a distinct swelling at the nodes; this may be due,
    at least in part, to the existence of transverse nodal diaphragms which
    enabled the dead shoots to resist contraction in the region of the
    nodes. The leaf-sheaths consist of numerous long and narrow segments
    often truncated distally, as in fig. 58, <i>B</i>, and as in the sheath
    of such a recent Horse-tail as <i>E. ramosissimum</i> shown in fig.
    58, <i>C</i>. In some specimens one occasionally finds indications of
    delicate acuminate teeth extending above the limits of a truncated
    sheath. Brongniart speaks of the existence of caducous acuminate teeth
    in his diagnosis of the species, and the example represented in fig.
    58, <i>B</i>, demonstrates the existence of such deciduous appendages.
    There is a very close resemblance between the fossil sheath of fig.
    58, <i>B</i>, with and without the teeth, and the leaf-sheath of the
    recent <i>Equisetum</i> in fig. 58, <i>C</i>. In some specimens of
    <i>E. columnaris</i> in which the cast is covered with a carbonaceous
    film, each segment in a leaf-sheath is seen to be slightly depressed in
    the median portion, which is often distinctly marked by numerous small
    dots, the edges of the segment being flat and smooth. The median region
    is that in which the stomata are found and on which deposits of silica occur.</p>

    previously referred to in unpublished notes as <i>C. giganteus</i>.

  <p>Schimper<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> speaks of this species as possibly the pith-cast of
    <i>Equisetites columnaris</i>, but his opinion cannot be maintained;
    the species first described by Bunbury has considerably larger stems
    than those of <i>E. columnaris</i>. It is not impossible, however,
    that <i>E. columnaris</i> and <i>E. Beani</i> may be portions of the
    same species. The chief difference between these forms is that of
    size; but we have not sufficient data to justify the inclusion of
    both forms under one name. Zigno<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>, in his work on the Oolitic
    Flora, figures an imperfect stem cast of <i>E. Beani</i> under the
    name of <i>Calamites Beani</i>, but the species has <span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>received little
    attention at the hands of recent writers. In 1886 Starkie Gardner<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
    figured a specimen which was identified by Williamson as an example of
    Bunbury’s species; but the latter pointed out the greater resemblance,
    as regards the external appearance of the Jurassic stem, to some
    of the recent arborescent Gramineae<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> than to the Equisetaceae.
    Williamson, with his usual caution, adds that such appearances have
    very little taxonomic value. Fig. 60 is reproduced from the block
    used by Gardner in his memoir on Mesozoic Angiosperms; he quotes
    the specimen as possibly a Monocotyledonous stem. The fossil is an
    imperfect cast of a stem showing two clearly marked nodal regions,
    but no trace of leaf-sheaths. A recent examination of specimens in
    the museums of Whitby, Scarborough, York and London has convinced me
    that the plant named by Bunbury <i>Calamites Beani</i> is a large
    <i>Equisetites</i>. As a rule the specimens do not show any indications
    of the leaf-sheaths, but in a few cases the sheaths have left fairly
    distinct impressions.</p>

    <figcaption class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 61. <i>Equisetites Beani</i> (Bunb.). From
      a specimen in the British Museum, ⅔ nat. size. (No. V. 2725.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In the portion of stem shown in fig. 61 the impressions of the leaf
    segments are clearly marked. This specimen affords much better evidence
    of the Equisetaceous character of the plant than those which are simply
    internal casts. The narrow projecting lines extending upwards from the
    nodes in the figured specimen probably represent the divisions between
    the several segments of each leaf-sheath.</p>

  <p>In the museums of Whitby and Scarborough there are some long specimens,
    in one case 44 cm. in length, and 33 cm. in circumference, which
    are probably casts of the broad pith-cavity. These casts are often
    transversely broken across at the nodes, so that they consist of three
    or four separate pieces which fit together by clean-cut faces. This
    manner of occurrence is most probably due to the existence of large and
    resistant nodal diaphragms which separated the sand-casts of adjacent
    internodes. In the York museum there are some large diaphragms, 10
    cm. in diameter, preserved separately in a piece of rock containing a
    cast of <i>Equisetites Beani</i>. The nodal diaphragms of some of the
    Carboniferous Calamites were the seat of cork development<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>and
    it may be that the frequent preservation of Equisetaceous diaphragms
    in Triassic and Jurassic rocks is due to the protection afforded by a
    corky investment.</p>

  <p>The stem shown in fig. 62 appears to be a portion of a shoot of <i>E.
    Beani</i> not far from its apical region. From the lower nodes there
    extend clearly marked and regular lines or slight grooves tapering
    gradually towards the next higher node; these are no doubt the
    impressions of segments of leaf-sheaths. The sheaths themselves have
    been detached and only their impressions remain. The flattened bands at
    the node of the stem in fig. 60, and shown also in fig. 61, mark the
    place of attachment of the leaf-sheaths. On some of these nodal bands
    one is able to recognise small scars which are most likely the casts of
    outgoing leaf-trace bundles.</p>

  <p>Some of the internal casts of this species are marked by numerous
    closely arranged longitudinal lines, which are probably the impressions
    of the inner face of a central woody cylinder. In the smaller specimen
    shown in fig. 62 we have the apical portion of a shoot in which the
    uppermost internodes are in an unexpanded condition.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to give a satisfactory diagnosis of this species
    without better material. The plant is characterised chiefly by the
    great breadth of the stem, and by the possession of leaf-sheaths
    consisting of numerous long and narrow segments. <i>Equisetites
    Beani</i> must have almost equalled in size the Triassic species, <i>E.
    arenaceus</i>, described above.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="E_lateralis">7. <i>Equisetites lateralis</i> Phill. Figs. 58, <i>F</i>, 63, and 64.</div>

  <p>This species is described at some length as affording a useful
    illustration of the misleading character of certain features which
    are entirely due to methods of preservation. The specific name was
    proposed by Phillips in his first edition of the <cite>Geology of the
    Yorkshire Coast</cite> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>for some very imperfect stems from the Lower
    Oolite rocks near Whitby<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>. The choice of the term <em>lateralis</em>
    illustrates a misconception; it was given to the plant in the belief
    that certain characteristic wheel-like marks on the stems were the
    scars of branches. Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> figured a specimen of this
    species in their <cite>Fossil Flora</cite>, and quoted a remark by “Mr
    Williamson junior” (afterwards Prof. Williamson) that the so-called
    scars often occur as isolated discs in the neighbourhood of the stems.
    Bunbury<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> described an example of the same species with narrow
    spreading leaves like those of a Palaeozoic <i>Asterophyllites</i>, and
    proposed this generic name as more appropriate than <i>Equisetites</i>.
    In all probability the example shown in fig. 63 is that which Bunbury
    described. It is certainly the same as one figured by Zigno<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
    as <i>Calamites lateralis</i> in his <cite>Flora fossilis formationis
    Oolithicae</cite>.</p>

    <figcaption class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 63. <i>Equisetites lateralis</i> Phill. From a
      specimen in the British Museum. Slightly reduced.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>This specimen illustrates a further misconception in the diagnosis of
    the species. The long linear appendages spreading from the nodes are,
    I believe, slender branches and not leaves; they have not the form
    of delicate filmy markings on the rock face, but are comparatively
    thick and almost woody in appearance. The true leaves are distinctly
    indicated at the nodes, and exhibit the ordinary features of toothed sheaths.</p>

  <p>Heer<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> proposed to transfer Phillips’ species to the genus
    <i>Phyllotheca</i>, and Schimper<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> preferred the generic term
    <i>Schizoneura</i>. The suggestion for the use of these two names would
    probably not have been made had the presence of the <i>Equisetum</i>
    sheaths been recognised.</p>

  <p>The circular depressions a short distance above each node are the
    ‘branch scars’ of various writers. Schimper suggested that these
    radially marked circles might be displaced nodal diaphragms.
    Andrae<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> figured the same objects in 1853 but regarded them as
    branch scars, although in the specimen he describes, there are several
    of them lying apart from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>the stems, and to one of them is attached
    a portion of a leaf-sheath. Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> points out that the
    internodal position of these supposed scars is an obvious difficulty;
    we should not expect to find branches arising from an internode. After
    referring to some specimens in the Oxford museum, he adds—“In presence
    of these facts the usual explanation of these structures appears to
    me, as to Heer, very doubtful.... We are driven to the very arbitrary
    assumption that they represent the lowest nodes of the lateral branches
    which were inserted above the line of the nodes of the stem.” Circular
    discs similar to those of <i>E. lateralis</i> have been found in the
    Jurassic rocks of Siberia<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> and elsewhere. There are one or two
    examples of such discs from Siberia in the British Museum. If the
    nodal diaphragms were fairly hard and stout, it is easy to conceive
    that they might have been pressed out of their original position when
    the stems were flattened in the process of fossilisation. It is not
    quite clear what the radial spoke-like lines of the discs are due to;
    possibly they mark the position of bands of more resistant tissue or
    of outgoing strands of vascular bundles. A detached diaphragm is seen
    in fig. 64 C; in the centre it consists of a flat plate of tissue, and
    the peripheral region is traversed by the radiating lines. In the stem
    of fig. 64, A the deeply divided leaf-sheaths are clearly seen, and an
    imperfect impression of a diaphragm is preserved on the face of the
    middle internode. In fig. 64 B a flattened leaf-sheath is shown with
    the free acuminate teeth fused basally into a continuous collar<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>.
    The short piece of stem of <i>Equisetites lateralis</i> shown in fig.
    58, <i>F</i>, shows how the free teeth may be outspread in a manner
    which bears some resemblance to the leaves of <i>Phyllotheca</i>,
    but a comparison with the specimens already described, and a careful
    examination of this specimen itself, demonstrate the generic identity
    of the species with <i>Equisetites</i>. The carbonaceous film on
    the surface of such stems as those of fig. 58, F, and 64, A, shows
    a characteristic shagreen texture which may possibly be due to the
    presence of silica in the epidermis as in recent Horse-tails.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

  <p>There is another species of <i>Equisetites</i>, <i>E. Münsteri</i>,
    Schk., from a lower geological horizon which has been compared
    with <i>E. lateralis</i>, and lends support to the view that the
    so-called branch-scars are nodal diaphragms<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>. This species also
    affords additional evidence in favour of retaining the generic
    name <i>Equisetites</i> for Phillips’ species. <i>Equisetites
    Münsteri</i> is a typical Rhaetic plant; it has been found at Beyreuth
    and Kuhnbach, as well as in Switzerland, Hungary and elsewhere. A
    specimen of <i>Equisetites</i> originally described by Buckman as
    <i>E. Brodii</i><a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>, from the Lower Lias of Worcestershire, may
    possibly be identical with <i>E. Münsteri</i>. The leaf-sheaths of this
    Rhaetic species consist of broad segments prolonged into acuminate
    teeth; some <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>of the examples figured by Schenk<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> show clearly
    marked impressions of displaced nodal diaphragms exactly as in <i>E.
    lateralis</i>. Another form, <i>Equisetum rotiferum</i> described by
    Tenison-Woods<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> from Australia, is closely allied to, or possibly
    identical with <i>E. lateralis</i>.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>It is characterised by having long and slender internodes, bearing
    at the nodes leaf-sheaths with five or six pointed segments, and by
    the frequent formation of branch-tubers. These tuberous branches
    closely resemble those which are formed on the underground shoots of
    <i>Equisetum arvense</i> L., <i>E. sylvaticum</i> L. and others; they
    occur either singly or in chains<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>. In the specimen shown in the
    figure the left-hand tuber is remarkably well preserved, its surface
    is somewhat sunk and shrivelled, and the apex is surrounded by a nodal
    leaf-sheath. A thin branched root is given off just below the point of
    insertion of the oval tuber.</p>

  <p>No other species of <i>Equisetites</i> affords such numerous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>examples
    of tubers as this Wealden plant. By some of the earlier writers the
    detached tubers of <i>E. Burchardti</i> were described as fossil seeds

  <p>The specimens shown in fig. 66 have been referred to another species,
    <i>E. Yokoyamae</i> Sew.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>; they were obtained from the Wealden
    beds of Sussex, but according to Mr Rufford, who discovered them, the
    smaller tubers of this species are not found in association with those
    of <i>E. Burchardti</i>. The stems are very narrow and the tubers
    have a characteristic elliptical form; the species is of little value
    botanically, but it affords another instance of the common occurrence
    of these tuberous branches in the Wealden Equisetums.</p>

  <p>Similar fossil tubers, on a much larger scale, have been found in
    association with the Triassic <i>Equisetites arenaceus</i>; with <i>E.
    Parlatori</i> Heer<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>, a Tertiary species from Switzerland, and with
    other Mesozoic and Tertiary stems. <i>E. Burejensis</i><a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>, described
    by Heer from the Jurassic rocks of Siberia, bears a close resemblance
    to the Wealden species.</p>

  <p>The description of the above species by no means exhausts the material
    which is available towards a history of fossil <span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>Equisetums. The
    examples which have been selected may serve to illustrate the kind of
    specimens that are usually met with, as well as some of the possible
    sources of error which have to be borne in mind in the description of
    species.</p>

  <p>Such Tertiary species as have been recorded need not be
    considered; they furnish us with no facts of particular interest
    from a morphological point of view. The wide distribution of
    <i>Equisetites</i>, especially during the Jurassic period, is one of
    the most interesting lessons to be learnt from a review of the fossil
    forms. No doubt a detailed comparison of the several species from
    different parts of the world would lead us to reduce the number of
    specific names; and at the same time it would emphasize the apparent
    identity of fossils which have been described from widely separated
    latitudes under different names.</p>

  <p>Specimens of <i>Equisetites</i> are occasionally found in plant-bearing
    beds apart from the other members of a Flora; this isolated manner of
    occurrence suggests that the plant grew in a different station from
    that occupied by Cycads and other elements of the vegetation<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>.</p>

  <p>A selection of Triassic and Jurassic species arranged in a tabular form
    demonstrates the world-wide distribution of this persistent type of
    plant<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="Phyllotheca">B. <i>Phyllotheca.</i></h4>

  <p>The generic name <i>Phyllotheca</i> was proposed by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> in
    1828 for some small fossil stems from the Hawkesbury river, near Port
    Jackson, Australia. The stems of this genus are divided into nodes
    and internodes and possess leaf-sheaths as in <i>Equisetum</i>, but
    <i>Phyllotheca</i> differs from other Equisetaceous plants in the form
    of the leaves and in the character of its sporophylls. We may define
    the genus as follows:—</p>

  <p>Plants resembling in habit the recent Equisetums. Stems simple or
    branched, divided into distinct nodes and internodes, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>the latter
    marked by longitudinal ridges and grooves; from the nodes are given
    off leaf-sheaths consisting of linear-lanceolate uninerved segments
    coherent basally, but having the form of free narrow teeth for the
    greater part of their length. The long free teeth are usually spread
    out in the form of a cup and not adpressed to the stem, the tips of the
    teeth are often incurved.</p>

  <p>The sporangia are borne on peltate sporangiophores attached to the stem
    between whorls of sterile leaves.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of <i>Phyllotheca</i> is unfortunately far from
    complete. The chief characteristic of the vegetative shoots consists
    in the cup-like leaf-sheaths; these are divided up into several
    linear segments, which differ from the teeth of an <i>Equisetum</i>
    leaf-sheath in their greater length and in their more open and
    spreading habit of growth. The large loose sheaths of the fertile
    shoots of some recent Horse-tails bear a certain resemblance to the
    sheaths of <i>Phyllotheca</i>. The diagnosis of the fertile shoots is
    founded principally on some Permian specimens of the genus described
    by Schmalhausen from Russia<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> and redescribed more recently by
    Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>. Prof. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> has, however, lately received
    some examples of <i>Phyllotheca</i> from the Coal-Measures of Asia
    Minor which bear strobili like those of the genus <i>Annularia</i>, a
    type which is dealt with in the succeeding chapter. A description of a
    few species will serve to illustrate the features usually associated
    with this generic type, as well as to emphasize the unsatisfactory
    state of our knowledge as to the real significance of such supposed
    generic characteristics.</p>

  <p>There are a few fossil stems from Permian rocks of Siberia,
    from Jurassic strata in Italy, and from Lower Mesozoic and
    Permo-Carboniferous beds in South America, South Africa, India and
    Australia which do not conform in all points to the usually accepted
    definition of <i>Equisetites</i>, and so justify their inclusion in
    an allied genus. On the other hand there are numerous instances of
    stems or branches which have been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>referred to <i>Phyllotheca</i> on
    insufficient grounds. Our knowledge of this Equisetaceous plant has
    recently been extended by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>, who has recorded its occurrence
    in the Coal-Measures of Asia Minor associated with typical Upper
    Carboniferous plants. The same author<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> has also brought forward
    good evidence for the Permian age of the beds in Siberia and Altai,
    where <i>Phyllotheca</i> has long been known. It is true that Zigno’s
    species of the genus occurs in Italian Jurassic rocks, but on the whole
    it would seem that this genus is rather a Permian than a Jurassic type.
    The species which Zeiller describes under the name <i>Phyllotheca
    Rallii</i> from the Coal-Measures of Herakleion (Asia Minor) shows some
    points of contact with <i>Annularia</i>. It is much to be desired,
    however, that we might learn more as to the reproductive organs of
    this member of the Equisetales; until we possess a closer acquaintance
    with the fructification we cannot hope to arrive at any satisfactory
    conclusion as to the exact position of the genus among the Calamarian
    and Equisetaceous forms. M. Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> informs me that his specimens
    of <i>P. Rallii</i>, which are to be fully described in a forthcoming
    work, include fossil strobili resembling those of <i>Annularia
    radiata</i>. The verticils of linear leaves fused basally into a sheath
    agree in appearance with the star-like leaves of <i>Annularia</i>,
    but in <i>Phyllotheca Rallii</i> the segments appear to spread in
    all directions and are not extended in one plane as in the typical
    <i>Annularia</i><a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>.</p>

  <h6 id="Phyllotheca_deliquescens">1. <i>Phyllotheca deliquescens</i> (Göpp.).</h6>

  <p>In an account of some fossil plants collected by Tchikatcheff in
    Altai, Göppert<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> describes and figures two imperfect stems of an
    Equisetum-like plant. Owing to the apparent absence of nodal lines
    on the surface of the stem the generic name <i>Anarthrocanna</i>
    is proposed for the fossils; and the manner in which the main axis
    appears to break up into slender branches suggested the specific name
    <i>deliquescens</i>. Schmalhausen<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> afterwards <span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>recognised the
    generic identity of Göppert’s fragments with the Indian and Australian
    stems referred to the genus <i>Phyllotheca</i> by McCoy<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> and
    Bunbury<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>.</p>

  <p>We may define the species as follows:—</p>

  <p>Stem reaching a diameter of 2–3 cm. with internodes as much as 4
    cm. long, the surface of which is traversed by longitudinal ridges
    and grooves which are continuous and not alternate at the nodes.
    Branches arise in verticils from the nodes. The leaves have the form
    of funnel-shaped sheaths split up into narrow and spreading linear
    segments, each of which is traversed by a median vein. The fertile
    shoot terminates in a loose strobilus bearing alternating whorls of
    sterile bracts and sporangiophores.</p>

  <p>The specimens on which this diagnosis is founded are for the most part
    fragments of sterile branches. Some of these present the appearance of
    Calamitean stems in which the ridges and grooves continue in straight
    lines from one internode to the next. Similar stem-casts have been
    referred by some writers to the allied genus <i>Schizoneura</i>, and
    it would appear to be a hopeless task to decide with certainty under
    which generic designation such specimens should be described. The
    portion of stem shown in fig. 67 affords an example of an Equisetaceous
    plant, probably in the form of a cast of a hollow pith, which might
    be referred to either <i>Phyllotheca</i> or <i>Schizoneura</i>. The
    specimen was found in certain South African rocks which are probably of
    Permo-Carboniferous age<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>. It agrees closely with some stems from
    India described by Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> as <i>Schizoneura gondwanensis</i>,
    and it also resembles equally closely the Australian specimens referred
    by Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> to <i>Phyllotheca australis</i> and some stems of
    <i>Phyllotheca indica</i> figured by Bunbury<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>.</p>

  <p>The longitudinal ridges and grooves shown in fig. 67 probably represent
    the broad medullary rays and the projecting wedges of secondary wood
    surrounding a large hollow <span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>pith, as in <i>Calamites</i>. In the
    Calamitean casts the ridges and grooves of each internode usually
    alternate in position with those of the next, as in <i>Equisetum</i>
    (fig. 54, A), but in <i>Phyllotheca</i>, <i>Schizoneura</i> and
    <i>Archaeocalamites</i> there is no such regular alternation at the
    nodes of the internodal vascular strands.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In <i>Phyllotheca</i> and <i>Schizoneura</i> there are no casts of
    ‘infranodal canals’ below each nodal line, but these are by no means
    always found in true Calamites. It is therefore practically impossible
    to determine the generic position of such fossils as that shown in fig.
    67 without further evidence than is afforded by leafless casts.</p>

  <p>A few examples of <i>Phyllotheca deliquescens</i> have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> described
    by Schmalhausen in which a branch bears clusters of sporangiophores,
    alternating with verticils of sterile bracts. The sporangiophores
    appear to have the form of stalked peltate appendages bearing
    sporangia, very similar to the sporangiophores of <i>Equisetum</i>.
    Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> has examined the best of Schmalhausen’s specimens,
    and a carefully drawn figure of one of the fertile branches is given in
    his <cite>Fossil Botany</cite>.</p>

  <p>The significance of this manner of occurrence of sporangiophores
    and whorls of sterile bracts on the fertile branch will be better
    understood after a description of the strobilus of <i>Calamites</i>.
    In <i>Phyllotheca</i> the sporangiophores appear to have been given
    off in whorls, which were separated from one another by whorls of
    sterile bracts, whereas in <i>Equisetum</i> there are no sterile
    appendages associated with the sporangiophores of the strobilus, with
    the exception of the annulus at the base of the cone. Heer<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> first
    drew attention to the fact that in <i>Phyllotheca</i> we have a form
    of strobilus or fertile shoot to a certain extent intermediate in
    character between <i>Equisetum</i> and <i>Calamites</i>.</p>

  <p>In abnormal fertile shoots of <i>Equisetum</i>, sporophylls
    occasionally occur above and below a sterile leaf-sheath. Potonié<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
    has figured such an example in which an apical strobilus is succeeded
    at a lower level by a sterile leaf-sheath, and this again by a second
    cluster of sporophylls. As Potonié points out, this alternation
    of fertile and sterile members affords an interesting resemblance
    between <i>Phyllotheca</i> and <i>Equisetum</i>. It suggests a partial
    reversion towards the Calamitean type of strobilus.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="P_Brongniarti">2. <i>Phyllotheca Brongniarti</i> Zigno. Fig. 68, A.</div>

  <p>This species of <i>Phyllotheca</i> from the Lower Oolite rocks of Italy
    is known only in the form of sterile branches. The leaves are fused
    basally into an open cup-like sheath which is dissected into several
    spreading and incurved linear segments. The internodes are striated
    longitudinally; they are about 2 mm. in diameter and 10 mm. in length.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>

  <p>The specimen represented in fig. 68, A, was originally described
    by the Italian palaeobotanist Zigno<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>; it serves to illustrate
    the points of difference between this genus and the ordinary
    <i>Equisetum</i>. The open and spreading sheaths clasping the nodes and
    the erect solitary branches give the plant a distinctive appearance.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="P_indica">3. <i>Phyllotheca indica</i> Bunb. and <i>P. australis</i> Brongn. Fig. 68, C.</div>

  <p>Sir Charles Bunbury<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> described several imperfect specimens from the
    Nagpur district of India under this name, but he <span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>expressed the opinion
    that it was not clear to him if the plant was specifically distinct
    from the <i>Phyllotheca australis</i> Brongn. previously recorded from
    New South Wales. Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> subsequently described a few other
    Indian specimens, but did not materially add to our knowledge of the
    genus. Bunbury’s specimens were obtained from Bharatwádá in Nagpur,
    in beds belonging to the Damuda series of the Lower Gondwana rocks,
    usually regarded as of about the same age as the Permian rocks of
    Europe.</p>

  <p><i>Phyllotheca indica</i> is represented by broken and imperfect
    fragments of leaf-bearing stems. The species is thus diagnosed by
    Bunbury:—“Stem branched, furrowed; sheaths lax, somewhat bell-shaped,
    distinctly striated; leaves narrow linear, with a strong and distinct
    midrib, widely spreading and often recurved, nearly twice as long as
    the sheaths.” An examination of the specimens in the Museum of the
    Geological Society of London, on which this account was based, has led
    me to the opinion that it is practically impossible to distinguish the
    Indian examples from <i>P. australis</i> described by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
    from New South Wales. The few specimens of the latter species which
    I have had an opportunity of examining bear out this view. In the
    smaller branches the axis of <i>P. indica</i> is divided into rather
    short internodes on which the ridges and grooves are faintly marked. In
    the larger stems the ridges and grooves are much more prominent, and
    continuous in direction from one internode to the next; a few branches
    are given off from the nodes of some of the specimens. The leaves are
    not very well preserved; they consist of a narrow collar-like basal
    sheath divided up into numerous, long and narrow segments, which are
    several times as long as the breadth of the sheath, and not merely
    twice as long as Bunbury described them. Each leaf-sheath has the form
    of a very shallow cup-like rim clasping the stem at a node, with long
    free spreading segments which are often bent back in their distal
    region. The general habit of the leafy branches appears to be identical
    with that of <i>P. australis</i> as figured by McCoy.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

  <p>Prof. Zeiller informs me that in the type-specimen on which Brongniart
    founded the species, <i>P. australis</i>, the sheath appears to be
    closely applied to the stem with a verticil of narrow spreading
    segments radiating from its margin. It may be, therefore, that in the
    Australian form there was not such an open and cup-like sheath as in
    <i>P. indica</i>; but it would be difficult, without better material
    before us, to feel confidence in any well marked specific distinctions
    between the Indian and Australian Phyllothecas.</p>

  <p>On the broader stems, such as that of fig. 67, we have clearly marked
    narrow grooves and broader and slightly convex ridges, which present
    an appearance identical with that of some Calamitean stems. In the
    specimen figured by Bunbury<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> in his Pl. X, fig. 6, there is a
    circular depression on the line of the node which represents the
    impression of the basal end of a branch; on the edges of the node
    there are indications of two other lateral branches. The nature of
    this stem-cast points umnistakeably to a woody stem like that of
    <i>Calamites</i>. The precise meaning of the ridges and grooves on the
    cast is described in the Chapter dealing with Calamitean plants.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">CALAMOCLADUS.</div>

  <p>Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> in his monograph on the coal-basin of Gard, has
    recently described under the name of <i>Calamocladus frondosus</i>
    what he believes to be the leaf-bearing axes of a Calamitean plant.
    The thicker branches are almost exactly identical in appearance with
    the broader specimens of <i>Phyllotheca</i>. The finer branches of
    <i>Calamocladus</i> bear cup-like leaf-sheaths which are divided
    into long and narrow recurved segments (fig. 67, B), precisely as
    in <i>Phyllotheca</i>. These comparisons lead one to the opinion
    that the <i>Phyllotheca</i> of Australia and India may be a close
    ally of the Permo-Carboniferous Calamitean plants. The form of the
    leaf-whorls of <i>Annularia</i> (Calamarian leaf-bearing branches) and
    of <i>Calamocladus</i> is of the same type as in <i>Phyllotheca</i>;
    the character of the medullary casts is also the same. The nature of
    the fertile shoot of <i>Phyllotheca</i> described by Schmalhausen from
    Siberia, with its alternating whorls of sterile and fertile leaves,
    is another point of agreement between this genus and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>Calamitean
    plants. An Equisetaceous species has been described from the Newcastle
    Coal-Measures of Australia by Etheridge<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> in which there are two
    forms of leaves, some of which closely resemble those of <i>Phyllotheca
    indica</i>, while others are compared with the sterile bracts of
    <i>Cingularia</i>, a Calamitean genus instituted by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>.</p>

  <p>When we turn to other recorded forms of <i>Phyllotheca</i> many of
    them appear on examination to have been placed in this genus on
    unsatisfactory grounds. Heer figures several stem fragments from the
    Jurassic rocks of Siberia as <i>P. Sibirica</i> Heer<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>, and it
    was the resemblance between this form and the English <i>Equisetites
    lateralis</i> which led to the substitution of <i>Phyllotheca</i>
    for <i>Equisetites</i> in the latter species. Without examining
    Heer’s material it is impossible to criticise his conclusions
    with any completeness, but several of his specimens, appear to
    possess leaf-sheaths more like those of <i>Equisetum</i> than of
    <i>Phyllotheca</i>.</p>

  <p>The frequent occurrence of isolated diaphragms and the comparatively
    long acuminate teeth of the leaf-sheath afford obvious points of
    resemblance to <i>Equisetites lateralis</i>. Some of the examples
    figured by Heer appear to be stem fragments, with numerous long and
    narrow filiform leaves different in appearance from those of other
    specimens which he figures. It may be that some of the less distinct
    pieces of stems are badly torn specimens in which the internodes have
    been divided into filiform threads. Heer also figures a fertile axis
    associated with the sterile stems, and this does not, as Heer admits,
    show the alternating sterile bracts such as Schmalhausen has described.
    So far as it is possible to judge from an examination of Heer’s figures
    and a few specimens from Siberia in the British Museum—and this is by
    no means a safe basis on which to found definite opinions—there appears
    to be little evidence in favour of separating the fossils described as
    <i>Phyllotheca Sibirica</i> from <i>Equisetites</i>. This Siberian form
    may indeed be specifically identical with <i>Equisetites lateralis</i> Phill.</p>

  <p>Various species of <i>Phyllotheca</i> have been described from
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>Jurassic and Upper Palaeozoic rocks in Australia. Some of these
    possess cup-like leaf-sheaths, and in the case of the thicker specimens
    they show continuous ridges and grooves on the internodes, as well
    as a habit of branching similar to that in some of the Italian
    Phyllothecas. In some of the stems it is however difficult to recognise
    any characters which justify the use of the term <i>Phyllotheca</i>.
    A fragment figured by Tenison-Woods<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> as a new species of
    <i>Phyllotheca</i>, <i>P. carnosa</i>, from Ipswich, Queensland,
    affords an example of the worthless material on which species have
    not infrequently been founded. The author of the species describes
    his single specimen as a “faint impression”; the figure accompanying
    his description suggests a fragment of some coniferous branch, as
    Feistmantel has pointed out in his monograph on Australian plants.</p>

  <p>It is important that a thorough comparative examination should be
    made of the various fossil Phyllothecas with a view to determine
    their scientific value, and to discover how far the separation of
    <i>Phyllotheca</i> and <i>Equisetites</i> is legitimate in each case.
    There is too often a tendency to allow geographical distribution to
    decide the adoption of a particular generic name, and this seems
    to have been especially the case as regards several Mesozoic and
    Palaeozoic Southern Hemisphere plants.</p>

  <p>The geological and geographical range of <i>Phyllotheca</i> is a
    question of considerable interest, but as already pointed out it
    is desirable to carefully examine the various records of the genus
    before attempting to generalise as to the range of the species.
    <i>Phyllotheca</i> is often spoken of as a characteristic member
    of the <i>Glossopteris</i> Flora of the Southern Hemisphere, and
    its geological age is usually considered to be Mesozoic rather than
    Palaeozoic.</p>

  <h4 id="Schizoneura">C. <i>Schizoneura.</i></h4>

  <p>The plants included under this genus were originally designated by
    Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> <i>Convallarites</i> and classed as Monocotyledons.
    Some years later Schimper and Mougeot<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>the opportunity of
    examining more perfect material from the Bunter beds of the Vosges, and
    proposed the new name <i>Schizoneura</i> in place of Brongniart’s term,
    on the grounds that the specimens were in all probability portions of
    Equisetaceous stems, and not Monocotyledons. Our knowledge of this
    genus is very limited, but the characteristics are on the whole better
    defined than in the case of <i>Phyllotheca</i>. The following diagnosis
    illustrates the chief features of <i>Schizoneura</i>.</p>

  <p>Hollow stems with nodes and internodes as in <i>Equisetum</i>; the
    surface of the internodes is traversed by regular ridges and grooves,
    which are continuous and not alternate in their course from one
    internode to the next. The leaf-sheaths are large and consist of
    several coherent segments; the sheaths are usually split into two or
    more elongate ovate lobes, and each lobe contains more than one vein.
    Fertile shoots are unknown.</p>

  <p>Two of the best known and most satisfactory species are <i>Schizoneura
    gondwanensis</i> Feist. and <i>S. paradoxa</i> Schimp. and Moug.</p>

  <div class="h7" id="S_gondwanensis"><i>Schizoneura gondwanensis</i> Feist. Fig. 69, A and B.</div>

  <p>This species is represented by numerous specimens from the Lower
    Gondwana rocks of India<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>; it is characterised by narrow articulated
    stems which bear large leaf-sheaths at the nodes. The sheaths may have
    the form of two large and spreading elongate-oval lobes, each of which
    is traversed by several veins (fig. 69, B), or the lobes may be further
    dissected into long linear single-veined segments, as in fig. 69, A. It
    is supposed that in the young condition each node bears a leaf-sheath
    consisting of laterally coherent segments which, as development
    proceeds, split into two or more lobes. Feistmantel records this
    species from the Talchir, Damuda and Panchet divisions of the Lower
    Gondwana series of India; these divisions are regarded as equivalent to
    the Permo-Carboniferous and Triassic rocks of Europe. The two specimens
    shown in fig. 69 are from the Lower Gondwana rocks of the Raniganj
    Coal-field, India.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

  <p>As already pointed out<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>, some of the specimens of flat and broader
    stems referred by Feistmantel to <i>Schizoneura</i> are identical
    in appearance with stems which have been described from India and
    elsewhere as species of <i>Phyllotheca</i>.</p>

      Feistmantel; slightly reduced.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>There are a few specimens of <i>S. gondwanensis</i> in the British
    Museum, but the genus is poorly represented in European collections.</p>

  <p>A similar plant was described in 1844 by Schimper and Mougeot<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> from
    the Bunter rocks of the Vosges as <i>Schizoneura paradoxa</i>. This
    species bears a very close resemblance to the Indian forms, and indeed
    it is difficult to point to any distinction of taxonomic importance.
    Feistmantel considers <span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>that the European plant has rather fewer
    segments in the leaf-sheaths, and that the Indian plant had somewhat
    stronger stems. Both of these differences are such as might easily be
    found on branches of the same species. It is, however, interesting to
    notice the very close resemblance between the Lower Trias European
    plant and the somewhat older member of the <i>Glossopteris</i> flora
    recorded from India and other regions, which probably once formed
    part of that Southern Hemisphere Continent which is known as Gondwana
    Land<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to minimise repetition and digression the following account of
    the Calamarieae is divided into sections, under each of which a certain
    part of the subject is more particularly dealt with. After a brief
    sketch of the history of our knowledge of <i>Calamites</i>, and a short
    description of the characteristics of the genus, the morphological
    features are more fully considered. A description of the most striking
    features of the better known Calamitean types is followed by a short
    discussion on the question of nomenclature and classification, and
    reference is made to the manner of occurrence of <i>Calamites</i> and
    to some of the possible sources of error in identification.</p>

  <h4 id="Historical_sketch">I. Historical Sketch.</h4>

  <p>In the following account of the Calamarieae the generic name
    <i>Calamites</i> is used in a somewhat comprehensive sense. As previous
    writers have pointed out, it is probable that under this generic name
    there may be included more than one type of plant worthy of generic
    designation. Owing to the various opinions which have been held by
    different authors, as to the relationship and botanical position of
    plants now generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span> included in the Calamarieae, there has been
    no little confusion in nomenclature. Facts as to the nature of the
    genus <i>Calamites</i> have occasionally to be selected from writings
    containing many speculative and erroneous views, but the data at our
    disposal enable us to give a fairly complete account of the morphology
    of this Palaeozoic plant.</p>

  <p>In the earliest works on fossil plants we find several figures of
    <i>Calamites</i>, which are in most cases described as those of fossil
    reeds or grasses. The <i>Herbarium diluvianum</i> of Scheuchzer<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>
    contains a figure of a Calamitean cast which is described as probably
    a reed. Another specimen is figured by Volkmann<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> in his <i>Silesia
    subterranea</i> and compared with a piece of sugar-cane. A similar
    flattened cast in the old Woodwardian collection at Cambridge is
    described by Woodward<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> as “part of a broad long flat leaf,
    appearing to be of some <i>Iris</i>, or rather an Aloe, but ’tis
    striated without.” Schulze<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>, one of the earlier German writers,
    figured a Calamitean branch bearing verticils of leaves, and described
    the fossil as probably the impression of an Equisetaceous plant. It
    has been pointed out by another German writer that the Equisetaceous
    character of <i>Calamites</i> was recognised by laymen many years
    before specialists shared this view.</p>

  <p>One of the most interesting and important of all the older records of
    <i>Calamites</i> is that published by Suckow<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> in 1784. Suckow is
    usually quoted as the author of the generic name <i>Calamites</i>;
    he does not attempt any diagnosis of the plant, but merely speaks of
    the specimens he is describing as “Calamiten.” The examples figured
    in this classic paper are characteristic casts from the Coal-Measures
    of Western Germany. Suckow describes them as ribbed stems, which were
    found in an oblique position in the strata and termed by the workmen
    Jupiter’s nails (“Nägel”). Previous writers had regarded the fossils
    as casts of reeds, but Suckow correctly points out that the ribbed
    character is hardly consistent with the view that the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>casts are those
    of reeds or grasses. He goes on to say that the material filling up
    the hollow pith of a reed would not have impressed upon it a number
    of ribs and grooves such as occur on the Calamites. He considers
    it more probable that the casts are those of some well-developed
    tree, probably a foreign plant. <i>Equisetum giganteum</i> L. is
    mentioned as a species with which <i>Calamites</i> may be compared,
    although the stem of the Palaeozoic genus was much larger than that
    of the recent Horse-tail. The tree of which the Calamites are the
    casts must, he adds, have possessed a ribbed stem, and the bark must
    also have been marked by vertical ribs and grooves on its <em>inner
    face</em>. It is clear, therefore, that Suckow inclined to the view
    that <i>Calamites</i> should be regarded as an <em>internal cast</em>
    of a woody plant. Such an interpretation of the fossils was generally
    accepted by palaeobotanists only a comparatively few years ago, and the
    first suggestion of this view is usually attributed to Germar, Dawes,
    and other authors who wrote more than fifty years later than Suckow.</p>

  <p>One of the earliest notices of <i>Calamites</i> in the present century
    is by Steinhauer<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>, who published a memoir in the Transactions
    of the American Philosophical Society in 1818 on <cite>Fossil reliquia
    of unknown vegetables in the Carboniferous rocks</cite>. He gives
    some good figures of Calamitean casts under the generic name of
    <i>Phytolithus</i>, one of those general terms often used by the older
    writers on fossils. Among English authors, Martin<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> may be mentioned
    as figuring casts of <i>Calamites</i>, which he describes as probably
    grass stems. By far the best of the earlier figures are those by
    Artis<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> in his <cite>Antediluvian Phytology</cite>. This writer does not
    discuss the botanical nature of the specimens beyond a brief reference
    to the views of earlier authors. Adolphe Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>, writing in
    1822, expresses the opinion that the Calamites are related to the
    genus <i>Equisetum</i>, and refers to M. de Candolle as having first
    suggested this view. In a later work Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> includes species
    of <i>Calamites</i> as figured by Suckow, Schlotheim, Sternberg and
    Artis in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>the family <i>Equisetaceae</i>. Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> give
    several figures of Calamites in their <cite>Fossil flora</cite>, but do not
    commit themselves to an Equisetaceous affinity.</p>

  <p>An important advance was made in 1835 by Cotta<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>, a German writer,
    who gave a short account of the internal structure of some Calamite
    stems, which he referred to a new genus <i>Calamitea</i>. The British
    Museum collection includes some silicified fragments of the stems
    figured and described by Cotta in his <cite>Dendrolithen</cite>. Some of the
    specimens described by this author as examples of <i>Calamitea</i> have
    since been recognised as members of another family.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PETZHOLDT AND UNGER.</div>

  <p>In 1840 Unger<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> published a note on the structure and affinities of
    <i>Calamites</i>, and expressed his belief in the close relationship of
    the Palaeozoic plant and recent Horse-tails.</p>

  <p>An important contribution to our knowledge of <i>Calamites</i> was
    supplied by Petzholdt<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> in 1841. His main contention was the
    Equisetaceous character of this Palaeozoic genus. The external
    resemblance between Calamite casts and <i>Equisetum</i> stems had long
    been recognised, but after Cotta’s account of the internal structure it
    was believed that the apparent relation between <i>Equisetum</i> and
    <i>Calamites</i> was not confirmed by the facts of anatomy. Petzholdt
    based his conclusions on certain partially preserved Permian stems from
    Plauenscher Grund, near Dresden. Although his account of the fossils
    is not accurate his general conclusions are correct. The specimens
    described by Petzholdt differ from the common Calamite casts in having
    some carbonised remnants of cortical and woody tissue. A transverse
    section of one of the Plauenscher Grund fossils is shown in fig. 70.
    The irregular black patches were described by Petzholdt as portions of
    cortical tissue, while he regarded the spaces as marking the position
    of canals like the vallecular canals in an <i>Equisetum</i>. Our more
    complete knowledge of the structure of a Calamite stem enables us to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>correlate the patches in which no tissue has been preserved with the
    broad medullary rays, which separated the wedge-shaped groups of xylem
    elements; the latter being more resistant were converted into a black
    coaly substance, while the cells of the medullary rays left little or
    no trace in the sandstone matrix. The thin black line, which forms the
    limit of the drawing in fig. 70, external to the carbonised wood, no
    doubt marks the limit of the cortex, and the appendage indicated in
    the lower part of the figure may possibly be an adventitious root. It
    is interesting to note that Unger<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> in 1844 expressed the opinion,
    which we now know to be correct, that the coaly mass in the specimens
    described by Petzholdt represented the wood, and that there was no
    proof of the existence of canals in the cortex as Petzholdt believed.</p>

  <p>Turning to Brongniart’s later work<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> we find an important <span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>proposal
    which led to no little controversy. While retaining the genus
    <i>Calamites</i> for such specimens as possess a thin bark and a ribbed
    external surface, showing occasional branch-scars at the nodes, and
    having such characters as warrant their inclusion in the Equisetaceae,
    he proposes a second generic name for other specimens which had
    hitherto been included in <i>Calamites</i>. The fossils assigned to
    his new genus <i>Calamodendron</i> are described as having a thick
    woody stem, and as differing from <i>Equisetum</i> in their arborescent
    nature. Brongniart’s genus <i>Calamodendron</i> is made to include
    the plants for which Cotta instituted the name <i>Calamitea</i>,
    and it is placed among the Gymnosperms. This distinction between
    the Vascular Cryptogam <i>Calamites</i> and the supposed Gymnosperm
    <i>Calamodendron</i> is based on the presence of secondary wood in the
    latter type of stem. The prominence formerly assigned to the power
    of secondary thickening possessed by a plant as a taxonomic feature,
    is now known to have been the result of imperfect knowledge. The
    occurrence of a cambium layer and the ability of a plant to increase in
    girth by the activity of a definite meristem, is a feature which some
    recent Vascular Cryptogams<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> share with the higher plants; and in
    former ages many of the Pteridophytes possessed this method of growth
    in a striking degree.</p>

  <p>Although Brongniart’s distinction between <i>Calamites</i> and
    <i>Calamodendron</i> has not been borne out by subsequent researches,
    the latter term is still used as a convenient designation for a special
    type of Calamitean structure. One of the earliest accounts of the
    anatomy of <i>Calamodendron</i> stems is by Mougeot<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>, who published
    figures and descriptions of two species, <i>Calamodendron striatum</i>
    and <i>C. bistriatum</i>.</p>

  <p>Some years later Göppert<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>, who was one of the greatest of the older
    palaeobotanists, instituted another genus, <i>Arthropitys</i><a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>,
    for certain specimens of silicified stems from the Permian rocks of
    Chemnitz in Saxony, which Cotta had previously placed in his genus
    <i>Calamitea</i> under the name of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span><i>Calamitea bistriata</i><a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>.
    Göppert rightly decided that the plants so named by Cotta differed
    in important histological characters from other species of
    <i>Calamitea</i>. The generic name <i>Arthropitys</i> has been
    widely adopted for a type of Calamitean stem characterised by
    definite structural features. The great majority of the petrified
    Calamite stems found in the English Coal-Measures belong to Göppert’s
    <i>Arthropitys</i>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">WILLIAMSON.</div>

  <p>The next proposal to be noticed is one by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> in 1868;
    he instituted the generic name <i>Calamopitys</i> for a few examples
    of English stems, which differed in the structure of the wood and
    primary medullary rays from previously recorded types. We have thus
    four names which all stand for generic types of Calamitean stems.
    Of these <i>Calamodendron</i> and <i>Arthropitys</i> are still used
    as convenient designations for stems with well-defined anatomical
    characters. The genus <i>Calamitea</i> is no longer in use, and
    Williamson’s name <i>Calamopitys</i> had previously been made use
    of by Unger<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> for plants which do not belong to the Calamarieae.
    As it is convenient to have some term to apply to such stems as
    those which Williamson made the type of <i>Calamopitys</i>, the name
    <i>Arthrodendron</i> is suggested by my friend Dr Scott<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> as a
    substitute for Williamson’s genus.</p>

  <p>The twofold division of the Calamites instituted by Brongniart has
    already been alluded to, and for many years it was generally agreed
    that both Pteridophytes and Gymnosperms were represented among the
    Palaeozoic fossils known as Calamites. The work of Prof. Williamson
    was largely instrumental in proving the unsound basis for this
    artificial separation; he insisted on the inclusion of all Calamites
    in the Vascular Cryptogams, irrespective of the presence or absence
    of secondary wood. By degrees the adherents of Brongniart’s views
    acknowledged the force of the English botanist’s contention. It is
    one of the many signs of the value of Williamson’s work that there is
    now almost complete accord among palaeobotanical writers as to the
    affinities of Calamitean plants.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>

  <p>In the following account of the Calamites, the generic name
    <i>Calamites</i> is used in a wide sense as including stems possessing
    different types of internal structure; when it is possible to recognise
    any of these structural types the terms <i>Calamodendron</i>,
    <i>Arthropitys</i> or <i>Arthrodendron</i> are used as subgenera. The
    reasons for this nomenclature are discussed in a later part of the
    Chapter.</p>

  <div class="center"><i>a. Stems.&#160; b. Leaves.&#160; c. Roots.&#160; d. Cones.</i></div>

  <p>No fossils are better known to collectors of Coal-Measure plants than
    the casts and impressions of the numerous species of <i>Calamites</i>.
    In sandstone quarries of Upper Carboniferous rocks there are frequently
    found cylindrical or somewhat flattened fossils, varying from one to
    several inches in diameter, marked on the surface by longitudinal
    ridges and grooves, and at more or less regular intervals by regular
    transverse constrictions. Similar specimens are still more abundant
    as flattened casts in the blocks of shale found on the rubbish heaps
    of collieries. The sandstone casts are often separated from the
    surrounding rock by a loose brown or black crumbling material, and the
    specimens in the shale are frequently covered by a thin layer of coal.</p>

  <p>Most of the earlier writers regarded such specimens as the impressions
    of the ribbed stems of plants similar to or identical with reeds or
    grasses. Suckow, and afterwards Dawes and others, expressed the opinion
    that the ordinary Calamite cast represented a hardened mass of sand
    or marl, which had filled up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> pith of a stem either originally
    fistular or rendered hollow by decay. The investigation of the internal
    structure confirmed this view, and proved that the surface-features of
    a Calamite stem do not represent the external markings of the original
    plant, but the form of the inner face of the cylinder of wood. The ribs
    represent the medullary rays of the original stem or branch, and the
    intervening grooves mark the position of the strands of xylem which are
    arranged in a ring round a large hollow pith<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>.</p>

  <p>With this brief preliminary account we may pass to a detailed
    description of the anatomical characters of <i>Calamites</i>.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Calamites</i> may be briefly defined as follows:—</p>

  <p>Arborescent plants reaching a height of several meters, and having a
    diameter of proportional size. In habit of growth the Calamites bore a
    close resemblance to <i>Equisetum</i>; an underground rhizome giving
    off lateral branches and erect aerial shoots bearing branches, either
    in whorls from regularly recurring branch-bearing nodes, or two or
    three from each node; and in some cases the stems bore occasional
    branches from widely separated nodes. The leaves were disposed in
    whorls either as star-shaped verticils on slender foliage shoots, or
    in the form of a circle of long narrow leaves on the node of a thicker
    branch. Adventitious roots were developed from the nodal regions of
    underground and aerial stems. The cones had the form of long and
    narrow strobili consisting of a central axis bearing whorls of sterile
    and fertile appendages; the latter in the form of sporangiophores
    bearing groups of sporangia. The strobili were heterosporous in
    some cases, isosporous in others. The stems had a large hollow pith
    bridged across by a transverse diaphragm at the nodes in the centre
    of the single stele; the latter consisted of a ring of collateral
    bundles separated from one another by primary medullary rays. Each
    group of xylem was composed of spiral, annular, scalariform and
    occasionally reticulate tracheids, the position of the protoxylem
    being marked by a longitudinal carinal canal. The shoots and roots
    grew in thickness by means of a regular cambium layer. The cortex
    consisted of parenchymatous and sclerenchymatous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>cells, with scattered
    secretory sacs. The increase in girth of the central cylinder was often
    accompanied by a considerable development of cortical periderm. The
    roots differed from the shoots in having no carinal canals, and in the
    possession of a solid pith and centripetally developed primary xylem
    groups alternating with strands of phloem.</p>

  <p>The above incomplete diagnosis includes only some of the more important
    structural features of the genus. Thanks to the researches begun by the
    late Mr Binney of Manchester and considerably extended by Carruthers,
    Williamson and later investigators, we are now in a position to give
    a fairly complete account of <i>Calamites</i>. The type of stem most
    frequently met with in a petrified condition in the English rocks is
    that to which Göppert applied the name <i>Arthropitys</i>, and it is
    this subgenus that forms the subject of the following description. Our
    knowledge of Calamitean anatomy is based on the examination of numerous
    fragments of petrified twigs and other portions of different specific
    types of the genus. It is seldom possible to differentiate specifically
    between the isolated fragments of stems and branches which are met
    with in calcareous or siliceous nodules. As so frequently happens in
    fossil-plant material, large specimens showing good surface features
    and broken fragments with well-preserved internal structure have to be
    dealt with separately.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">YOUNG STEM.</div>

  <h5 id="Calamites_Stems"><i>a. Stems.</i></h5>

  <p>A transverse section of a young twig, such as is represented in
    fig. 71, illustrates the chief characteristics of the <em>primary
    structure</em> of a young branch of <i>Calamites</i>. The figure has
    been drawn from a section originally described by Hick<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> in 1894.
    A very young Calamite twig bears an exceedingly close resemblance to
    the stem of a recent <i>Equisetum</i>. The axial region of the stem
    may be occupied by parenchymatous cells, or the absence of cells in
    the centre may indicate the beginning of the gradual formation of the
    hollow pith, which is one of the characteristics of <i>Calamites</i>.
    The student of petrified Palaeozoic <span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>plants must constantly be on his
    guard against the possible misinterpretation of Stigmarian ‘rootlets,’
    which are frequently found in intimate association with fossil tissues.
    The intrusion of these rootlets is admirably illustrated by a section
    of a Calamite stem in the Williamson Collection (No. 1558) in which
    the hollow pith, 2 cm. broad, contains more than a dozen Stigmarian
    appendages.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In the figured specimen of a Calamite twig (fig. 71) there is a clearly
    marked differentiation into a cortical region and a large stele or
    central cylinder. The pith-cells are already partially disorganised,
    but there still remain a few fairly large parenchymatous cells internal
    to the ring of vascular bundles. The few irregular projections into the
    cavity of the large pith consist of small fragments of cells, which may
    be the result of fungal action. Mycelia of fungi are occasionally met
    with in the tissues of older Calamite stems.</p>

  <p>The position of the primary xylem groups is shown by the conspicuous
    and regularly placed canals, <i>c</i>; these have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span> formed
    in precisely the same manner as the corresponding spaces in an
    <i>Equisetum</i> stem, and they are spoken of in both genera as the
    carinal canals. Each canal owes its origin to the disorganization and
    tearing apart of the protoxylem elements and the surrounding cells.
    This may be occasionally seen in examples of very young Calamites; the
    canals of a young twig often contain apparently isolated rings which
    are coils of elongated spiral threads. Fig. 72, <i>B</i> represents
    the canal of a twig, cut in an oblique direction, in which the remains
    of spiral tracheids are distinctly seen. In the stem of fig. 71 the
    development has not advanced far enough to enable us to clearly
    define the exact limits of each xylem strand. The smaller elements
    bordering the canals constitute the primary xylem, they are fairly
    distinct on the outer margin of some of the canals seen in the section.
    Between the small patches of primary xylem the outward extensions of
    the parenchyma of the pith constitute the primary medullary rays,
    <i>mr</i>. The distinct line encircling the canals and primary xylem
    has been described by Hick as marking the position of the endodermis,
    but it may possibly owe its existence to the tearing of the tissues
    along the line where cambial activity is just beginning. This layer of
    delicate dividing cells would constitute a natural line of weakness.
    External to this line we have a zone of tissue <i>a</i>, <i>d</i>,
    containing here and there larger cells with black contents, which
    are no doubt secretory sacs. It is impossible to distinguish with
    certainty any definite phloem groups, but in other specimens these
    have been recognised immediately external to each primary xylem
    group; the bundles were typically collateral in structure. Towards
    the periphery of the twig the preservation is much less perfect; the
    outer portion of the inner cortex, <i>d</i>, consists of rather smaller
    and thicker-walled cells, but this is succeeded by an ill-defined
    zone containing a few scattered cells, <i>b</i>, which have been more
    perfectly preserved. The twig is too young to show any secondary tissue
    in the cortex; but the tangential walls in some of the cortical cells
    afford evidence of meristematic activity, which probably represents
    the beginning of cork-formation. The limiting line, <i>e</i>, possibly
    represents the cuticularised outer walls of an epidermal layer. The
    irregularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span> wavy character of the surface of the specimen is probably
    the result of shrinking, and does not indicate original surface
    features.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">VASCULAR SYSTEM.</div>

  <p>In examining sections of calcareous nodules from the coal seams one
    meets with numerous fragments of small Calamitean twigs with little
    or no secondary wood; in some of these there is a small number of
    carinal canals, in others the canals are much more abundant. The former
    probably represent the smaller ramifications of a plant, and the latter
    may be regarded as the young stages of branches capable of developing
    into stout woody shoots<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>. Longitudinal sections of small branches
    teach us that the xylem elements next the carinal canals are either
    spiral or reticulate in character, the older tracheids being for the
    most part of the scalariform type, with bordered pits on the radial
    walls. This and other histological characters are admirably shown
    in the illustrations accompanying Williamson and Scott’s memoir on
    <i>Calamites</i>. The student should treat the account of the anatomy
    of <i>Calamites</i> given in these pages as introductory to the much
    more complete description by these authors. They thus describe the
    course of the vascular bundles in a Calamitean branch:—</p>

  <p>“The bundle-system of <i>Calamites</i> bears a general resemblance to
    that of <i>Equisetum</i>. A single leaf-trace enters the stem from each
    leaf, and passes vertically downwards to the next node. In the simplest
    cases the bundle here forks, its two branches attaching themselves to
    the alternating bundles which enter the stem at this node. In other
    cases both the forks attach themselves to the same bundle, so that,
    in this case, there is no regular alternation. In other cases, again,
    the bundle runs past one node without forking, and ultimately forms a
    junction with the traces of the second node below its starting-point.
    These variations may all occur in the same specimen. The xylem at the
    node usually forms a continuous ring, for where the regular dichotomous
    forks of the bundles are absent their place is usually taken by
    anastomoses<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>.”</p>

  <p>As in <i>Equisetum</i>, the xylem at the nodes possesses certain
    characteristic features which distinguish it from the internodal
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>strands. It has already been pointed out that the xylem of
    <i>Equisetum</i> increases in breadth at the nodes (p. 251, fig. 55,
    4); the same is true of <i>Calamites</i>. In fig. 72, <i>C</i>, we have
    part of a radial section of a Calamite twig in which the broad mass
    of short nodal tracheids is clearly shown; this nodal wood forms a
    prominent projection towards the pith. In the lower part of the section
    the remains of some spiral protoxylem tracheids are seen in a carinal canal.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The tracheids of the nodal wood are often reticularly pitted, and so
    differ in appearance from the ordinary scalariform elements.</p>

  <p>It is rare to find the phloem clearly preserved, but in specimens where
    it has been possible to examine this portion of the vascular bundles,
    it is found to consist of elongated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span> cambiform cells and sieve-tubes.
    An unusually perfect specimen has been described by Renault<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> in
    which the phloem elements are preserved in silica. Fig. 72, <i>D</i>,
    is copied from one of Renault’s drawings, the sieve-tubes, <i>s</i>,
    <i>s</i>, show several distinct sieve-plates on the lateral walls
    of the tubes, reminding one to some extent of the sieve-tubes in a
    Bracken Fern. The cells, <i>p</i>, <i>p</i>, associated with the
    sieve-tubes are square-ended elongated parenchymatous elements. Another
    characteristic feature illustrated by longitudinal sections is the
    nodal diaphragm; except in the smallest branches the interior of each
    internode is hollow, and the ring of vascular bundles is separated from
    the pith-cavity by a band of parenchymatous tissue. At each node this
    parenchyma extends across the central cavity in the form of a nodal
    diaphragm, as in the stem of <i>Equisetum</i>.</p>

  <p>By far the greater number of the petrified fragments of
    <i>Calamites</i> afford proof of cambial activity, and possess obvious
    secondary tissues. In exceptionally perfect specimens the xylem
    tracheids are found to be succeeded externally by a few flattened
    thin-walled cells which are in a meristematic condition (fig. 72,
    <i>A</i>, <i>c</i>); these constitute the cambium zone, and it is
    the <em>secondary structure</em> that results from the activity of the
    meristematic cells that we have now to consider.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">SECONDARY THICKENING.</div>

  <p>In petrified examples of branches in which the secondary thickening
    has reached a fairly advanced stage, the wood is usually the outermost
    tissue preserved, the more external tissues having been detached along
    the line of cambium cells. It is only in a few cases that we are able
    to examine all the tissues of older examples.</p>

  <p>The specimen represented in fig. 73 illustrates very clearly the
    extension of the hollow pith up to the inner surface of the vascular
    ring; the disorganisation of the pith-cells which had already begun in
    the twig of fig. 71 has here advanced much further. The bluntly rounded
    projections represent the prominent primary xylem strands, each of
    which is traversed by the characteristic carinal canal. Alternating
    with the wedge-shaped groups of secondary xylem, <i>x</i>, we have
    the broad <span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>principal medullary rays, <i>mr</i>, which become slightly
    narrower towards the outside. The inner face of each of these wide
    rays has a concave form, due to the less resistent nature of the
    medullary-ray cells as compared with the stronger xylem. The regularly
    sinuous form of the inner face of the vascular cylinder enables one
    to realise how the Calamite-casts (figs. 82, 99, and 101) have come
    to have the regular ridges and grooves on their surface. The broad
    ridges on the cast mark the position of the wide medullary rays, while
    the grooves correspond to the more prominent ends of the vascular
    strands. The tissues external to the wood have not been preserved in
    the example shown in fig. 73. Some silicified specimens described by
    Stur<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> from Bohemia and now in the Museum of the Austrian Geological
    Survey, Vienna, admirably illustrate the connection between the surface
    features of a Calamite cast and the anatomy of the stem.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">ARTHROPITYS.</div>

  <p>In the large section of a calcareous nodule diagrammatically shown in
    fig. 17 <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> (p. 85) the secondary wood of a slightly flattened
    Calamite is the most prominent plant fragment. The pith-cavity has been
    almost obliterated by the lateral compression of the woody cylinder,
    but the presence of the carinal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>canals along the inner edge of the
    wood may still be readily recognised. The appearance presented by a
    transverse section of the secondary wood of a Calamite is that of
    regular radial series of rather small rectangular tracheids, with
    occasional secondary medullary rays consisting of narrow and radially
    elongated parenchymatous cells. The principal rays<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> in the
    <i>Arthropitys</i> type of a Calamite stem are often found to gradually
    decrease in breadth as they pass into the secondary wood, until in the
    outer portion of the wood the primary medullary rays are practically
    obliterated by the formation of interfascicular xylem.</p>

  <p>In fig. 74, <i>A</i>, we have a portion of a single xylem group
    of a thick woody stem. The stem from which the figure has been
    drawn was originally described by Binney<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> as <i>Calamodendron
    commune</i>; we now recognise it as a typical example of the subgenus
    <i>Arthropitys</i>. The specific term <em>communis</em> was used by
    Ettingshausen<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> in 1855 in a comprehensive sense to include more
    than twenty species of the genus <i>Calamites</i>, but since Binney’s
    use of the term it has come to be associated with a definite type of
    <i>Arthropitys</i> stem, in which the primary medullary rays decrease
    rapidly in breadth towards the periphery of the wood. The wood of
    Binney’s stem<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> measures 2·5 cm. across, but the pith-cavity has
    been crushed to the limits of a narrow band represented in the figure
    by the shaded portion. The strand of cells, <i>s</i>, in the pith is
    a portion of a Stigmarian appendage (“rootlet”), which penetrated
    into the hollow stem of the Calamite and became petrified by the
    same agency to which the preservation of the stem is due. These
    intruded Stigmarian appendages are of constant occurrence in the
    calcareous nodules; their intimate association with the tissues of
    other plants is often a serious source of error in the identification
    of petrified tissues. The inner portion of one of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>xylem groups
    is shown in fig. 74, <i>A</i>. External to the carinal canal, the
    xylem tracheids are disposed in regular series and associated with
    numerous narrow secondary medullary rays. The width of the xylem wedge
    increases gradually as we pass outwards, this is due to the formation
    of interfascicular xylem, which in the more peripheral portion of
    the stem extends across the primary medullary rays. The few primary
    medullary-ray cells shown in the drawing illustrate the characteristic
    tangentially elongated form and large size of the parenchymatous
    elements. Williamson and Scott have pointed out that the tangentially
    elongated form of the medullary-ray cells is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span> result of active
    growth, and not merely the expression of the tangential stretching of
    the stem consequent on secondary thickening.</p>

  <p>A glance at the complete transverse section of the stem,—of which a
    small portion is shown in fig. 74 <i>A</i>,—suggests the existence
    of annual rings in the wood, but this appearance of rings is merely
    the result of compression. The secondary wood of a Calamite does not
    exhibit any regular zones of growth comparable with the annual rings of
    our forest trees.</p>

  <p>Before passing to other examples of Calamitean stems, reference may
    be made to the sections shown in figs. 75 and 76, which illustrate
    some further points in the structure of Binney’s stems. In fig. 75
    the xylem tracheids are shown at <i>x</i>, and between them the
    secondary medullary rays present the appearance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span> long and narrow
    parenchymatous cells; as the section is tangential the characteristic
    scalariform character of the tracheids is not shown, the ladder-like
    bordered pits being confined to the radial walls of the tracheal
    elements. The much greater length than breadth of the cells which form
    the rays associated with the xylem tracheids, is a characteristic
    feature in Calamitean stems. The breadth of the principal ray,
    <i>m</i>, shows that the section has passed through the wood a short
    distance from the pith; in a tangential section cut further into the
    wood the breadth of the principal rays would be considerably reduced.
    The large medullary-ray tissue consists of square-walled parenchymatous
    cells. The more highly magnified section, in fig. 76, shows a central
    group of parenchyma containing a few transversely cut tracheids, but
    the two kinds of elements are not clearly differentiated in the figure;
    this group of cells is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span> an outgoing leaf-trace which is enclosed by
    the strongly curved tracheids of the stem. The section is taken from
    the node of a stem where several leaf-trace bundles are passing out to
    a whorl of leaves; the few cells intercalated between the tracheids
    belong to the parenchyma of the secondary medullary rays.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">ARTHROPITYS. SURFACE FEATURES.</div>

  <p>In the small portion of a stem represented in fig. 74 <i>B</i>, the
    cortical tissues have been partially preserved; at the inner edge, next
    the hollow pith, there are two xylem groups, each with a carinal canal,
    and between them is part of a broad “principal” medullary ray<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>. The
    cambium has not been preserved, but beyond this region we have some
    of the large cells, <i>c</i>, of the inner cortex; these are followed
    by a few remnants of a smaller-celled tissue, and external to this
    part of the cortex there is a series of triangular groups, <i>h</i>,
    consisting of small thick-walled cells alternating with spaces which
    were originally occupied by more delicate parenchyma. The darker
    groups constitute hypodermal strands of mechanical tissue or stereome
    which lent support to the stem. The surface of a stem possessing such
    supporting strands would probably assume a longitudinally wrinkled or
    grooved appearance on drying; the intervening parenchyma, contracting
    and yielding more readily, would tend to produce shallow grooves
    alternating with the ridges above the stereome strands.</p>

  <p>The complete section of the stem of which a small portion is shown in
    fig. 74 <i>B</i>, is figured by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> in his 12th memoir on
    Coal-Measure plants. The section was obtained from Ashton-under-Lyne
    in Lancashire; it illustrates very clearly a method of preservation
    which is occasionally met with among petrified plants. The walls of the
    various tissue elements are black in colour and somewhat ragged, and
    the general appearance of the section is similar to that of a section
    of a charred piece of stem. It is possible that the Calamite twig was
    reduced to charcoal before petrifaction by a lightning flash or some
    other cause.</p>

  <p>It is often said that the surface of a Calamite stem was probably
    marked by regular ridges and grooves similar to those <span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>of the
    pith-cast, and that such external features are connected with the
    arrangement of the tissues in the vascular cylinder. The indication
    of grooves and ridges on the bark of fossil Calamites is no doubt the
    result of the existence in the hypoderm of firm strands alternating
    with strands of less resistant cells. It is very common to find
    Calamite pith-casts covered with a layer of coal presenting a ribbed
    surface, but this is simply due to the moulding of the coaly film on an
    internal pith-cast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span> The broad grooves on such a specimen as that of
    fig. 77 are, on the other hand, probably an indication of the existence
    of hypoderm bands similar to those in fig. 74 <i>B</i>, <i>h</i>. The
    specimen from which fig. 77 is drawn shows many interesting features.
    The figure given by Grand’Eury, of which fig. 77 is a copy, is somewhat
    idealised, but the various surfaces can be made out in the fossil. The
    surface of the coaly envelope surrounding the pith-cast, <i>a</i>,
    is distinctly grooved, but the depressions have nothing to do with
    the surface features of the wood or the pith-cast; they are no doubt
    due to the occurrence of alternating bands of thick- and thin-walled
    tissue in the hypodermal region of the cortex; the peripheral strands
    of bast cells would stand out as prominent ribs as the stem tissue
    contracted during fossilisation. At <i>b</i> (fig. 77) we have a view
    of the wood in which the position of the principal rays is indicated
    by fine longitudinal lines at regular intervals; the oval projections
    just below the nodal line are probably the casts of infranodal canals
    (<i>cf.</i> p. 324). At <i>a</i> the characteristic pith-cast is seen
    with a small branch-scar on the node. The scar on the middle node,
    <i>N</i> 2, is probably that of a root, and a root <i>R</i> is still
    attached to the node, <i>N</i> 3.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">PERIDERM IN STEMS.</div>

  <p>An interesting feature observed in some specimens of older Calamite
    branches is the development of periderm or cork. This is illustrated on
    a large scale by a unique specimen originally described by Williamson
    in 1878<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>. Figs. 78 and 79 represent transverse and longitudinal
    sections of this stem. This unusually large petrified stem was found
    in the Coal-Measures of Oldham, in Lancashire. In the slightly reduced
    drawing, fig. 78, the large and somewhat flattened pith, <i>p</i>, 4·2
    cm. in diameter, is shown towards the bottom of the figure. Surrounding
    this we have 58 or 59 wedge-shaped projecting xylem groups and broad
    medullary rays; the latter soon become indistinguishable as they
    are traced radially through the thick mass of secondary wood, 5 cm.
    wide, composed of scalariform tracheids and secondary medullary rays
    (fig. 78, 3). The secondary wood presents the features characteristic
    of <i>Calamites</i> (<i>Arthropitys</i>) <i>communis</i> (Binney).
    External to the wood there is a broken-up mass, about 5·5 cm. wide
    composed of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>regularly arranged (fig. 78, 2) and rather thick-walled
    cells; this consists of periderm, a secondary tissue, which has been
    developed by a cork-cambium during the increase in girth of the plant.
    The more delicate cortical tissues have not been preserved, and the
    more resistant portion of the bark has been broken up into small pieces
    of corky tissue, among which are seen numerous Stigmarian appendages,
    pieces of sporangia and other plant fragments. These associated
    structures cannot of course be shown in the small-scale drawing of the figure.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">CALLUS WOOD.</div>

  <p>The development of cork in a younger Calamite stem is clearly shown in
    a specimen described by Williamson and Scott in their Memoir of 1894.
    In a transverse section of the stem several large cells of the inner
    cortex are seen to be in process of division by tangential walls, and
    giving rise to radially arranged periderm tissue<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>.</p>

  <p>The section diagrammatically sketched in fig. 80 is that of a Calamite
    twig in which the wood appears to have been injured, and the wound has
    been almost covered over by the formation of callus wood. The young
    trees in a Palaeozoic forest might easily be injured by some of the
    large amphibians, which were the highest representatives of animal
    life during the Carboniferous period, just as our forest trees are
    often barked by deer, rabbits, and other animals. Fissures might also
    be formed by the expansion of the bark under the heating influence of
    the sun’s rays<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>. Such a specimen as that of fig. 80 gives an air
    of living reality to the petrified fragments of the Coal period trees.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>It is well known how a wound on the branch of a forest tree becomes
    gradually overgrown by the activity of the cambium giving rise to a
    thick callus, which gradually closes over the wounded surface in the
    form of two lips of wood which finally meet over the middle of the
    scar. The two lips of callus are clearly shown in the fossil branch
    arching over the tear in the wood just beyond the ring of carinal
    canals. The tissue external to the wood represents the imperfectly
    preserved cortex. A section which was cut parallel to that of fig. 80
    shows a continuous band of wood beyond the wound, and the latter has
    the form of a small triangular gap; this section appears to have passed
    across the wound where it was narrower and has already been closed over
    by the callus. The formation of a rather different kind of callus wood
    has been described by Renault<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> and by Williamson and Scott<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>,
    in stems where aborted or deciduous branches have been overgrown and
    sealed up by cambial activity.</p>

  <p>Some of the features to be noticed in longitudinal sections of Calamite
    stems have already been described, at least as regards younger
    branches. The specimen shown in fig. 81 illustrates the general
    appearance of a stem as seen in tangential and radial section. In the
    lower portion, <i>T</i>, the course of the vascular bundles is shown
    by the black lines which represent the xylem tracheids, bifurcating
    and usually alternating at each node. Between the xylem strands are
    the broad principal medullary rays. At <i>b</i> a branch has been cut
    through on its passage out from the parent stem, just above the nodal
    line. In tangential sections of Calamite stems one frequently sees
    both branches and leaf-trace bundles (fig. 83, <i>A</i>), passing
    horizontally through the wood and enclosed by strongly curved and
    twisted tracheids. In the upper part of the figure (81, <i>R</i>),
    the section has passed through the centre of the stem, and the wood
    is seen in radial view; each node is bridged across by a diaphragm
    of parenchymatous cells capable of giving rise to a surface layer of
    periderm<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>.</p>

  <p>An outgoing branch, as seen in a tangential section of a stem, consists
    of a parenchymatous pith surrounded by a ring of vascular bundles, in
    which the characteristic carinal canals have not yet been formed, but
    if the section has cut the branch further from its base, there may be
    seen a circle of irregular gaps marking the position of the carinal
    canals. Such gaps are often occupied by thin parenchyma, and contain
    protoxylem elements. The outgoing branches, as seen in a tangential
    section of a Calamite stem, are seen to be connected with the wood of
    the parent stem by curved and sinuous tracheids, which give <span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>to the
    stem-wood a curiously characteristic appearance<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>, as if the xylem
    elements had been pushed aside and contorted by the pressure of the
    outgoing member. A tangential section through a Pine stem<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> in the
    region of a lateral branch presents precisely the same features as in
    <i>Calamites</i>. The branches are given off from the stem immediately
    above a node and usually between two outgoing leaf-trace bundles.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">RHIZOME OF CALAMITES.</div>

  <p>Specimens of pith-casts occasionally present the appearance of a
    curved and rapidly tapered ram’s horn, and the narrow end of such a
    cast is sometimes found in contact with the node of another cast. This
    juxtaposition of casts is shown unusually well in fig. 82. In some of
    the published restorations of <i>Calamites</i> the plant is represented
    as having thick branches attached to the main stem by little more than
    a point. Williamson<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> clearly explained this apparently unusual
    and indeed physically impossible method of branching, by means of
    sections of petrified stems. The branches seen in fig. 82 are of
    course pith-casts, and in the living plant the pith of each branch was
    surrounded by a mass of secondary wood developed from as many primary
    groups of xylem as there are grooves on the surface of the cast, each
    of the grooves on an internode corresponding to the projecting edge
    of a xylem group. At the junction of one branch with another the pith
    was much narrower and the enclosing wood thicker, so that the tapered
    ends of the cast merely show the continuity by a narrow union between
    the pith-cavities of different branches. Most probably the casts of
    fig. 82 are those of a branched rhizome which grew underground, giving
    off aerial shoots and adventitious roots. There is a fairly close
    resemblance between the Calamite casts of fig. 82 and a stout branching
    rhizome of a Bamboo, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Bambusa arundinacea</i> Willd.; it
    is not surprising that the earlier writers looked upon the Calamite as
    a reed-like plant.</p>

  <p>Before leaving the consideration of stem structures there <span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>is another
    feature to which attention must be drawn. On the casts shown in fig. 82
    there is a circle of small oval scars situated just below the nodes,
    these are clearly shown at <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>. Each of the
    scars is in reality a slight projection from the upper end of an
    internodal ridge. As the ridges correspond to the broad inner faces of
    medullary rays, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span> small projection at the upper end of each ridge
    is a cast of a depression or canal which existed in the medullary
    tissue of the living plant. There have been various suggestions as to
    the meaning of these oval projections; several writers have referred
    to them as the points of attachments of roots or other appendages,
    but Williamson proved them to be the casts of canal-like gaps which
    traversed the upper ends of principal medullary rays in a horizontal
    direction. In a tangential section of a Calamite stem the summit of
    each primary medullary ray often contains a group of smaller elements
    which are in process of disorganisation, and in some cases these cells
    give place to an oval and somewhat irregular canal. In the diagrammatic
    tangential section represented in fig. 83, <i>A</i> the upper end of
    each ray is perforated by a large oval space, which has been formed
    as the result of the breaking down of a horizontal band of cells.
    Williamson designated these spaces <em>infranodal canals</em>. While
    proving that they had nothing to do with the attachment of lateral
    members, he suggested that they might be concerned with secretion; but
    their physiological significance is still a matter of speculation. The
    casts of infranodal canals are especially large and conspicuous in the
    subgenus <i>Arthrodendron</i>, a form of Calamite characterised by
    certain histological features to be referred to later. Williamson<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>
    originally regarded the presence of infranodal canals as one of the
    distinguishing features of <i>Arthrodendron</i>, but they occur also
    in the casts of the commoner type <i>Arthropitys</i>. As a rule
    we have only the cast of the inner ends of the infranodal canals
    preserved as slight projections like those in fig. 83, <i>A</i>; but
    in one exceptionally interesting pith-cast described by Williamson,
    these casts of the infranodal canals have been preserved as slender
    spoke-like columns radiating from the upper ends of the ridges of the
    infranodal region of a pith-cast.</p>

    began his researches into the structure of Carboniferous plants. A
    joiner, who was employed by Williamson to make a piece of machinery
    for grinding fossils, brought a number of sandstone fragments as an
    offering to his employer, whom he found to be interested in stones.
    The specimens “were in the main the merest rubbish, but amongst them,”
    writes Williamson, “I detected a fragment which was equally elegant
    and remarkable.... In later days, when the specimen so oddly and
    accidentally obtained, came to be intelligently studied, its history
    became clear enough, and the priceless fragment is now one of the most
    precious gems in my cabinet<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>.”</p>

  <h5><i>Comparison of three types of structure met with in Calamitean
    stems</i>,—Arthropitys, Arthrodendron, <i>and</i> Calamodendron.</h5>

  <div class="sidenote">ARTHROPITYS.</div>

  <p>The anatomical features which have so far been described as
    characteristic of <i>Calamites</i> represent the common type met
    with in the English Coal-Measures. The same type occurs also in
    France, Germany and elsewhere. It is that form of stem known as
    <i>Arthropitys</i>, a sub-genus of <i>Calamites</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Arthropitys</i> may be briefly diagnosed as follows,—confining our
    attention to the structure of the stem: A ring of collateral bundles
    surrounds a large hollow pith, each primary xylem strand terminates
    internally in a more or less bluntly rounded apex traversed by a
    longitudinally carinal canal. The principal medullary rays consist of
    large-celled parenchyma, of which the individual elements are usually
    tangentially elongated as seen in transverse section, and four or five
    times longer than broad as seen in a tangential longitudinal section.
    The secondary xylem consists of scalariform and reticulately pitted
    tracheids; the interfascicular xylem may be formed completely across
    each primary ray at an early stage in the growth of the stem<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>, or
    it may be developed more gradually so as to leave a tapering <span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>principal
    ray of parenchyma between each primary xylem bundle. In the latter case
    the principal rays present the characteristic appearance shown in figs.
    71, 74, <i>A</i>, 75 and 78, a type of stem which we may refer to as
    <i>Calamites</i> (<i>Arthropitys</i>) <i>communis</i>. In the former
    case the stem presents the appearance shown in fig. 83, <i>D</i><a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>.
    A third variety of <i>Arthropitys</i> stem is one which was originally
    named by Göppert <i>Arthropitys bistriata</i>; in this form the
    principal rays retain their individuality as bands of parenchyma
    throughout the whole thickness of the wood<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>. Such stems as those
    of figs. 73 and 74, <i>B</i>, may be young examples of <i>Arthropitys
    communis</i> or possibly of <i>A. bistriata</i>. The narrow secondary
    medullary rays of <i>Arthropitys</i> usually consist of a single row
    of cells which are three to five times higher than broad, as seen
    in tangential longitudinal section. Infranodal canals occur in some
    examples of <i>Arthropitys</i>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">ARTHRODENDRON.</div>

  <p>In the subgenus <i>Arthrodendron</i>, a type of stem first recognised
    by Williamson and named by him <i>Calamopitys</i><a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>, the principal
    medullary rays consist of <em>prosenchymatous cells</em> (<i>i.e.</i>
    elongated pointed elements) and not parenchyma. These elongated
    elements are not pitted like tracheids, and they are shorter and
    broader than the xylem elements. In some examples of this subgenus the
    primary rays are bridged across at an early stage by the formation
    of secondary interfascicular xylem, and in others they persist as
    bands of ray tissue, as in <i>Arthropitys</i>. Other characteristics
    of <i>Arthrodendron</i> are the abundance of reticulated instead of
    scalariform tracheids in the secondary wood, and the large size of the
    infranodal canals.</p>

  <p>Fig. 83, <i>D</i> represents part of a transverse section of
    <i>Arthrodendron</i>; in this stem the rays have been occupied by
    interfascicular xylem at a very early stage of the secondary growth.
    The section from which fig. 83, <i>D</i> is drawn was described by
    Williamson in 1871; the complete section shows about 80 carinal canals
    and primary xylem groups. The prosenchymatous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>form of the principal
    medullary rays is seen in fig 83, <i>C</i>, and the reticulate pitting
    on the radial wall of a tracheid is shown in fig. 83, <i>B</i>.
    Fig. 83, <i>A</i> illustrates the large infranodal canals as seen
    in a tangential section of a stem. The same section shows also the
    course of the vascular bundles characteristic of <i>Calamites</i>
    as of <i>Equisetum</i>, and the position of outgoing leaf-traces is
    represented by unshaded areas in the black vascular strands.</p>

  <p>The subgenus <i>Arthrodendron</i> is very rarely met with, and our
    information as to this type is far from complete<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>.</p>

  <p>The third subgenus <i>Calamodendron</i> has not been discovered
    in English rocks, and our knowledge of this type is derived from
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>French and German silicified specimens<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>. There is the same
    large hollow pith surrounded by a ring of collateral bundles with
    carinal canals, as in the two preceding subgenera. The tracheids are
    scalariform and reticulate, and the secondary medullary rays consist
    of rows of parenchymatous cells which are longer than broad, as in
    <i>Arthropitys</i> and <i>Arthrodendron</i>.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The most characteristic feature of <i>Calamodendron</i> is the
    occurrence of several rows of radially disposed thick-walled
    prosenchymatous elements (fig. 84, <i>b</i>) on either flank of each
    wedge-shaped group of xylem. Each principal ray is thus nearly filled
    up by bands of fibrous cells on the sides of adjacent xylem groups,
    but the centre of each principal ray is occupied by a narrow band of
    parenchyma (fig. 84, <i>c</i>). The relative breadth of the xylem and
    prosenchymatous bands has been made use of by Renault as a specific
    character in <i>Calamodendron</i> stems. Fig. 84 is copied from a
    drawing recently published by this French author of a new species of
    <i>Calamodendron</i>, <i>C. intermedium</i><a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>. In this case the
    bands of fibrous cells, <i>b</i>, are slightly broader, as seen in a
    transverse section of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>stem, than the bands of xylem tracheids,
    <i>a</i>. The narrow band, <i>c</i>, consists of four rows of the
    parenchymatous tissue of a medullary ray. At the inner end of each
    group of tracheids there is a large carinal canal.</p>

  <p>The question of the recognition of the pith-casts of stems possessing
    the structure of any of the three subgenera of <i>Calamites</i> is
    referred to in a later section of this chapter.</p>

  <h4 id="Calamites_Leaves"><i>b.</i> <i>Leaves</i></h4>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="hang"><i>Leaves of Calamites and Calamitean foliage-shoots, including an
      account of</i> (α) Calamocladus (Asterophyllites) <i>and</i> (β) Annularia.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Our knowledge of the structure and manner of occurrence of Calamite
    leaves is very incomplete. There are numerous foliage-shoots among the
    fossils of the Coal-Measures which are no doubt Calamitean, but as
    they are nearly always found apart from the main branches and stems,
    it is generally impossible to do more than speak of them as probably
    the leaf-bearing branches of a Calamite. The familiar fossils known
    as <i>Asterophyllites</i>, and in recent years often referred to the
    genus <i>Calamocladus</i>, are no doubt Calamitean shoots; but they are
    usually found as isolated fragments, and it is seldom that we are able
    to refer them to definite forms of <i>Calamites</i>. Another common
    Coal-Measure genus, <i>Annularia</i>, is also Calamitean, and at least
    some of the species are no doubt leafy shoots of <i>Calamites</i>.
    Although it is generally accepted that the fossils referred to
    as <i>Asterophyllites</i> or <i>Calamocladus</i> are portions of
    <i>Calamites</i>, and not distinct plants, it is convenient, and indeed
    necessary, to retain such a term as <i>Calamocladus</i> as a means of
    recording foliage-shoots, which may possess both a botanical and a
    geological value.</p>

  <p>Some of the Calamite casts, especially those referred to the subgenus
    <i>Calamitina</i>, are occasionally found with leaves attached to the
    nodes. In some stems the leaves are arranged in a close verticil, and
    each leaf has a narrow linear form and is traversed by a single median
    vein. Figures of Calamite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span> stems with verticils of long and narrow
    leaves may be found in Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>, and in the writings of
    many other authors<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>. In the specimen shown in fig. 85 the leaves
    are preserved apart from the stem, but from their close association
    with a Calamite cast, and from the proofs afforded by other specimens,
    it is quite certain they formed part of a whorl of leaves attached to
    the node of a true Calamite, and a stem having that particular type
    known as <i>Calamitina</i><a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> (figs. 99, 100). It is probable that in
    some Calamites, and especially in younger shoots, the leaves had the
    form of narrow sheaths split up into linear segments. This question has
    already been referred to in dealing with certain Palaeozoic fossils
    referred to <i>Equisetites</i><a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>A few years ago the late Thomas Hick<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>, of Manchester, described
    the structure of some leaves which he believed to be those of a
    Calamite. He found them attached to a slender axis which possessed the
    characteristics of a young Calamite branch. There can be little doubt
    that his specimens are true Calamite leaves. The sketches of fig. 86
    have been made from the sections originally described by Hick. Fig.
    86, 1 shows a leaf in transverse section; on the outside there is a
    well-defined <span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>epidermal layer with a limiting cuticle. Internal to
    this we have radially elongated parenchymatous cells forming a loose
    or spongy tissue, the cells being often separated by fairly large
    spaces (fig. 86, 5), especially in the region of the blunt lateral
    wings of the leaf. Some of these cells contain a single dark dot, which
    in all probability is the mineralised nucleus. These pallisade-like
    cells probably contained chlorophyll and constituted the assimilating
    tissue of the leaf. In the centre there is a circular strand of cells
    limited by a layer of larger cells with black contents, enclosing an
    inner group of small-celled parenchyma and traversed by a few spiral
    or scalariform tracheids constituting the single median vein. It is
    hardly possible to recognise any phloem elements in the small vascular
    bundle; there appear to be a few narrow tracheids surrounded by larger
    parenchymatous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span> elements (fig. 86, 2). At one point in the epidermis
    of fig. 86, 1, there appears to be a stoma, but the details are not
    very clearly shown (fig. 86, 4); the two cells, <i>s</i>, <i>s</i>,
    bordering the small aperture are probably guard-cells.</p>

  <p>The nature of the assimilating tissue, the comparatively thick band of
    thin-walled cells with intercellular spaces, and the exposed position
    of the stomata suggest that the plant lived in a fairly damp climate;
    at least there is nothing to indicate any adaptation to a dry climate.</p>

  <p>In the Binney collection of plants in the Woodwardian Museum,
    Cambridge, there is a species of a very small shoot bearing three or
    four verticils of leaves which possess the same structure as those of
    fig. 86. We may probably regard such twigs as the slender terminal
    branches of Calamitean shoots.</p>

  <h5 id="Calamocladus">α. <i>Calamocladus</i> (<i>Asterophyllites</i>).</h5>

  <p>The generic name <i>Asterophyllites</i> was proposed by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
    in 1822 for a fossil previously named by Schlotheim<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>
    <i>Casuarinites</i>, and afterwards transferred to Sternberg’s
    genus <i>Annularia</i>. In 1828 Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> gave the following
    diagnosis of the fossils which he included under the genus
    <i>Asterophyllites</i>:—“Stems rarely simple, usually branched, with
    opposite branches, which are always disposed in the same plane; leaves
    flat, more or less linear, pointed, traversed by a simple median
    vein, free to the base.” Lindley and Hutton described examples of
    Brongniart’s genus as species of <i>Hippurites</i><a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>, and other
    authors adopted different names for specimens afterwards referred to
    <i>Asterophyllites</i>.</p>

  <p>At a later date Ettingshausen<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> and other writers expressed the view
    that the fossils which Brongniart regarded as a distinct genus were the
    foliage-shoots of <i>Calamites</i>, and Ettingshausen went so far as to
    include them in that genus. In view of the generally expressed opinion
    as to the Calamitean nature of <i>Asterophyllites</i>, Schimper<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>
    proposed the convenient generic <span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>name <i>Calamocladus</i> for “rami et
    ramuli foliosi” of <i>Calamites</i>. Some recent authors have adopted
    this genus, but others prefer to retain <i>Asterophyllites</i>. In a
    recent important monograph by Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Calamitean foliage-shoots
    are included under the two names, <i>Asterophyllites</i> and
    <i>Calamocladus</i>; the latter type of foliage-shoots he associates
    with the stems of the subgenus <i>Calamodendron</i>, and the former
    he connects with those Calamitean stems which belong to the subgenus
    <i>Arthropitys</i>.</p>

  <p>It is an almost hopeless task to attempt to connect the various forms
    of foliage-shoots with their respective stems, and to determine what
    particular anatomical features characterised the plants bearing
    these various forms of shoots. We may adopt Schimper’s generic name
    <i>Calamocladus</i> in the same sense as <i>Asterophyllites</i>, but
    as including such other foliage-shoots as we have reason to believe
    belonged to <i>Calamites</i>. Those leaf-bearing branches which
    conform to the type known as <i>Annularia</i> are however not included
    in <i>Calamocladus</i>, as we cannot definitely assert that these
    foliage-shoots belong in all cases to Calamitean stems. Grand’Eury’s
    use of <i>Calamocladus</i> in a more restricted sense is inadvisable as
    leading to confusion, seeing that this name was originally defined in a
    more comprehensive manner as including Calamitean leaf-bearing branches
    generally. We may define <i>Calamocladus</i> as follows:—</p>

  <p>Branched or simple articulated branches bearing whorls of uni-nerved
    linear leaves at the nodes; the leaves may be either free to the base
    or fused basally into a cup-like sheath (<i>e.g.</i> Grand’Eury’s
    <i>Calamocladus</i>). The several acicular linear leaves or segments
    which are given off from the nodes spread out radially in an open
    manner in all directions; they may be either almost at right angles to
    the axis or inclined at different angles. Each segment is traversed by
    a single vein and terminates in an acuminate apex.</p>

  <p>As a typical example of a Calamitean foliage-shoot the species
    <i>Calamocladus equisetiformis</i> (Schloth.) may be briefly
    described. The synonymy of the commoner species of fossil plants is a
    constant source of confusion and difficulty; in order to illustrate
    the necessity of careful comparison of specimens <span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>and published
    illustrations, it may be helpful to quote a few synonyms of the species
    more particularly dealt with. The exhaustive lists drawn up by Kidston
    in his <cite>Catalogue of Palaeozoic plants in the British Museum</cite> will
    be found extremely useful by those concerned with a systematic study of
    the older plants.</p>

  <p class="noindent">The above synonyms do not exhaust the list<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>, but they
    suffice to illustrate the necessity of a careful comparison in drawing
    up tables of species, in connection with geographical distribution or
    for other purposes.</p>

  <p><i>Calamocladus equisetiformis</i> may be briefly defined as follows:—A
    central axis possessing a hollow pith of Calamitean character, divided
    externally into well-marked slightly constricted nodes and internodes;
    from the nodes long narrow and free leaves are borne in whorls; from
    the axils of some of the leaves lateral branches are given off inclined
    at a fairly wide angle to the main axis, and bearing crowded verticils
    of spreading acicular leaves.</p>

  <p>The unusually good specimen, 38·5 cm. long, shown on a much reduced
    scale in fig. 87, illustrates the characteristic habit of this
    form of <i>Calamocladus</i>. It is from the Radstock coal-field of
    Somersetshire, one of the best English localities for Coal-Measure
    plants. An exceedingly good collection of Radstock plants has recently
    been presented to the British Museum by Mr J. McMurtrie; it includes
    many fine specimens of <i>Calamites</i>. A small example—probably of
    this species—from Coalbrook Dale, near Dudley, in Shropshire, and now
    in the British Museum, illustrates very well the appearance of a young
    and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>partially expanded Calamitean foliage-shoot. The central axis, 6·5
    cm. in length, includes about 15 internodes, and terminates in a bud
    covered by several small leaves. Lateral branches are given off at a
    wide angle, and small unexpanded buds occur in the axils of several of
    the leaves.</p>

  <p>As an example of the leaf-bearing branches which Grand’Eury has
    recently described as <i>Calamocladus</i>, using the genus in a more
    restricted sense than is adopted in the present chapter, reference may
    be made to the fragment shown in fig. 68, <i>A</i>. The foliage-shoots
    of this type bore verticils of linear leaves, coherent basally in the
    form of a cup, at the ends of branches and not in a succession of
    whorls on each branch. The association of reproductive organs, in the
    form of long and narrow strobili, with <i>Calamocladus</i> is referred
    to in the sequel.</p>

  <p>The specimens described by Grand’Eury are in the École des Mines
    Museum, Paris; some of the shoots which are well preserved bear a
    resemblance in habit of growth to the genus <i>Archaeocalamites</i>.</p>

  <h5 id="Annularia">β. <i>Annularia.</i></h5>

  <p>In 1820 this generic name was applied by Sternberg<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> to some
    specimens of branches bearing verticils of linear leaves. In 1828
    Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> thus defined the genus <i>Annularia</i>:—“Slender stem,
    articulated, with opposite branches arising above the leaves. Leaves
    verticillate, flat, frequently obtuse, traversed by a single vein,
    fused basally and of unequal length.”</p>

  <p>In the works of earlier writers we find frequent illustrations of
    specimens of <i>Annularia</i>, which are compared with Asters and other
    recent flowering plants. Lehmann<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> contributed a paper to the Royal
    Academy of Berlin in 1756, in which he referred to certain fossil
    plants as probable examples of flowers, among them being a specimen of
    <i>Annularia</i>. He refers to the occurrence of fossil ferns and other
    plants, and asks why we do <span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>not find flowers of the rose or tulip;
    his object being “not to acquire vain glory, but to give occasion for
    others to look into the matter more clearly.”</p>

  <p>The general habit of the fossils which are now included under
    <i>Annularia</i> agrees closely with that of <i>Calamocladus</i>. There
    is the same spreading form and a similar foliage in the two genera,
    but in <i>Annularia</i> the members of a whorl are always fused into
    a basal sheath, and the segments are not of equal length. We may thus
    summarise the characteristic features of the genus:—</p>

  <p>Opposite branches are given off in one plane from the nodes of a
    main axis; the leaves are in the form of narrow sheaths divided into
    numerous and unequal linear or narrow lanceolate segments, each with
    a median vein. The segments in each whorl appear to be spread out in
    one plane very oblique to the axis of a branch, instead of spreading
    radially in all directions; the lateral segments are usually longer
    than the upper and lower members of a whorl. The vegetative branches
    possess the same type of structure as <i>Calamites</i>.</p>

  <p>A comparison of <i>Annularia</i> and <i>Phyllotheca</i> has already
    been made in Chapter IX. (p. 282). Potonié<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> has recently given a
    detailed account of Annularian leaves; he compares them with those of
    <i>Equisetum</i>, and describes the occurrence on the lamina of each
    leaf-segment of a broad central band or midrib, with a groove, probably
    containing stomata, on either side. He shows that in well-preserved
    specimens of <i>Annularia</i>, it is possible to recognise certain
    minute surface-features, such as the presence of hairs and stomata,
    which enable one to detect a close resemblance between the leaves of
    Calamite stems and those of Annularian shoots.</p>

  <p>It is not always easy to distinguish between <i>Annularia</i> and
    <i>Calamocladus</i>; the collar-like basal sheath in the leaves of
    the former is a characteristic feature, but that cannot always be
    recognised. On the other hand, the leaves of <i>Calamocladus</i> may
    sometimes be flattened out on the surface of the rock and simulate the
    deeply cut sheaths of <i>Annularia</i>. It is difficult to decide how
    far the manner of occurrence of Annularian <span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>leaves in one plane, which
    is commonly insisted on as a generic character, is an original feature,
    or how far it is the result of compression in fossilisation. Probably
    the leaves of a living <i>Annularia</i> were spread out at right angles
    to the axis, as in the ‘verticils’ of such a plant as <i>Galium</i>.</p>

  <p>Dawson<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> has described some fossils from the Devonian rocks of
    Canada as species of <i>Asterophyllites</i>; the figures bear a closer
    resemblance to the genus <i>Annularia</i>. The same author figures
    some irregularly whorled impressions as <i>Protannularia</i>, which
    appear to be identical with a fossil described by Nicholson<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> from
    the Skiddaw slates (Ordovician) of Cumberland as <i>Buthotrephis
    radiata</i>, but the specimens are too imperfect to admit of accurate
    determination.</p>

  <p>This species was figured by Scheuchzer<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> in his <cite>Herbarium
    Diluvianum</cite>, and compared by him with a species of <i>Galium</i>
    (Bedstraw). Brongniart first made use of the generic name
    <i>Annularia</i> for this common Coal-Measure species, which may be
    defined as follows:—</p>

  <p>Stem reaching a diameter of about 6–8 cm., with internodes 6–12 cm.
    in length, the surface either smooth or faintly ribbed. Primary
    branches given off in opposite pairs from the nodes, the lateral
    branches giving off smaller branches disposed in the same manner. The
    smaller branches bear verticils of leaves at each node; both leaves
    and ultimate branches being in one plane. The leaves are narrow,
    lanceolate-spathulate in form, broadest <span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>about the middle, 1–5 cm. in
    length and 1–3 mm. broad, hairy on the upper surface<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>; each leaf is
    traversed by a single vein.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Each whorl contains 16–32 segments, which are connected basally into
    a collar or narrow sheath; the lateral segments are usually longer
    than the upper and lower. The branches are about 6–20 mm. broad, with
    finely ribbed internodes 3–7 cm. long, bearing verticils of leaves; the
    ultimate branches arise in pairs in the axils of the lateral segments
    of the verticils.</p>

  <p>The strobili are of the <i>Calamostachys</i><a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> type and are borne
    on the main branches or possibly on the stem; they have a long and
    narrow form and are attached in verticils at the nodes. Each strobilus
    consists of a central axis bearing alternate whorls of linear
    lanceolate sterile bracts and sporangiophores, about half as numerous
    as the sterile bracts; each sporangiophore bears four ovoid sporangia.</p>

  <p>The anatomical structure of a specimen referred to <i>Annularia
    stellata</i> has been described by Renault<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>. The cortex <span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>consists
    of parenchyma traversed by lacunae and limited peripherally by a denser
    hypodermal tissue. In the stele Renault describes 14 xylem strands,
    each with a large carinal canal. The pith was apparently large and
    hollow. The same author describes an <i>Annularia</i> strobilus in
    which the lower sporangiophores bear macrosporangia, and the upper
    microsporangia.</p>

  <p>Principal branches 8–12 mm. wide, with internodes 8–10 cm. in length,
    giving off two opposite branches at the nodes; from the secondary
    branches arise smaller branches in opposite pairs. The leaf-verticils
    and branches are all in one plane. Each verticil consists of 12–18
    spathulate segments, 3–10 mm. long, cuneiform at the base and broader
    above, with an acuminate tip; the lateral segments are slightly longer
    than the upper and lower members of a whorl.</p>

  <p>The small and crowded leaf-whorls give to this species a characteristic
    appearance, which readily distinguishes it from the larger-leaved forms
    such as <i>Annularia stellata</i>. A fossil figured by Lhwyd<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> in
    1699 as <i>Rubeola mineralis</i> is no doubt an example of <i>Annularia
    sphenophylloides</i>.</p>

  <p>Annularian branches are occasionally found with cones given off
    from the axils of some of the leaf-whorls. An interesting specimen,
    which is now in the Leipzig Museum, was described by Sterzel in
    1882<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>, showing cones attached to a vegetative shoot of <i>Annularia
    sphenophylloides</i>. The long and narrow strobili—2·5 cm. long and
    about 6 mm. broad—appear very large in proportion to the size of the
    vegetative branches. A fertile shoot consists of a central axis bearing
    whorls of bracts alternating with sporangiophores, to each of which
    are attached four sporangia. The specimen in fig. 89, <i>A</i>, does
    not show the details clearly; each transverse constriction represents
    the attachment of a whorl of linear bracts; the whole cone appears to
    consist of a series of short broad segments. The divisions in the lower
    half of each segment mark the position of the sterile bracts, while
    those of the upper half represent the outlines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span> of the upper sporangia
    of each whorl of sporangiophores, the lower sporangia being hidden by
    the ring of linear bracts<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>. On some portions of the specimen of
    fig. 89, <i>A</i>, it is possible to recognise the outlines of cells on
    the coaly surface-film; these probably belong to the sporangium wall.
    This type of cone is included under the genus <i>Calamostachys</i>,
    a name applied to Calamitean strobili with certain morphological
    characters, as described on p. 351.</p>

  <h5 id="Calamites_Roots"><i>c. Roots.</i></h5>

  <p>In 1871 Williamson<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> described some sections of what he considered
    to be a distinct variety of a Calamite stem. The chief peculiarity
    which he noticed lay in the absence of carinal canals, and in the solid
    pith. Some years later the same observer<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> came to the conclusion
    that the specimens were probably those of a plant generically
    distinct from <i>Calamites</i>; he accordingly proposed a new name
    <i>Astromyelon</i>. Subsequently Cash and Hick<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> gave an account
    of some examples of apparently another form of plant, to which they
    gave the name <i>Myriophylloides Williamsonis</i>; and Williamson<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>
    suggested the term <i>Helophyton</i> as a more suitable generic
    designation. It was, however, demonstrated by Spencer<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> that the
    plant described by Cash and Hick was identical with Williamson’s
    <i>Astromyelon</i>. Williamson<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> then gave an account of several
    specimens of this type illustrating various stages in the growth and
    development of the <i>Astromyelon</i> ‘stems,’ which he compared with
    the rhizome of the recent genus <i>Marsilia</i>.</p>

  <p>In 1885 Renault<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> published an account of <i>Astromyelon</i> in
    which he brought forward good evidence in favour of regarding it as
    a Calamitean root. The same author has recently given some excellent
    figures and a detailed description of certain specific types of these
    Calamite roots, and Williamson and Scott’s memoir on the roots of
    <i>Calamites</i> has rendered our knowledge <span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>of <i>Astromyelon</i>
    almost complete. Some of the finest specimens, in which the organic
    connection between typical Calamite stems and <i>Astromyelon</i> roots
    is clearly demonstrated, are in the Natural History Museum, Paris.
    There are several sections also from English material which show the
    connection between root and stem very clearly.</p>

    Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>, Weiss<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>, Stur, and other writers<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>. The large
    stem-cast of fig. 90 illustrates the manner of occurrence of long
    branched roots on the nodes of a Calamite growing in sandy or clay
    soil. The lower and more darkly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>shaded portion of the specimen is
    covered by a layer of coal representing the carbonised wood and cortex,
    which has been moulded on to the sandstone pith-cast. In fig. 77 (p.
    316) a fairly thick root is seen, in organic connection with one of the
    nodes, <i>N</i> 3, and on <i>N</i> 2 there is a scar of another root.</p>

  <p>There are certain external characters by which one may often recognise
    a Calamitean root. There is no division into nodes and internodes as
    in stems, and as the pith of the root was usually solid the parallel
    ribs and grooves of stem-casts are not present. In smaller flattened
    roots there may sometimes be seen a central or excentric black line
    representing the stele, and the surface of the root presents a curious
    wrinkled or shagreen texture, probably due to the shrinkage of the
    loose lacunar cortex. The occasional excentric position of the stele is
    no doubt due to the displacement of the vascular cylinder as a result
    of the rapid decay of the cortical tissues. In the Bergakademie of
    Berlin there are some unusually good examples of Calamite casts bearing
    well-preserved root-impressions; these include the original specimens
    figured by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>.</p>

  <p>No doubt some of the roots figured by various writers under the
    names <i>Pinnularia</i><a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> and <i>Hydatica</i><a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> belong to
    <i>Calamites</i>, but it is often impossible to identify detached
    specimens with any certainty.</p>

  <p>The section figured diagrammatically in fig. 91 <i>A</i> shows the
    characteristic single series of large lacunae, <i>l</i>, in the
    middle cortical region. In the centre there is a wide solid pith
    surrounded by a ring of vascular tissue, <i>x</i>. The appearance of
    the middle cortex is very like that of the stem of a water-plant such
    as <i>Myriophyllum</i>, the Water Milfoil; it shows that the Calamite
    roots grew either in water or swampy ground. In fig. 91 <i>B</i>, the
    root characters are clearly seen; the centre of the stele is occupied
    by large parenchymatous cells which are rather longer than broad in
    longitudinal view; at the periphery there are four protoxylem groups
    <i>px</i>, alternating with four groups of phloem, <i>ph</i>, the
    latter being situated a little <span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>further from the centre of the stele.
    The structure is therefore that of a typical tetrarch root. In the
    example represented in the figure secondary thickening has begun, and
    the cambial cells internal to each phloem group have given rise to a
    few radially disposed tracheids, <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>. Beyond the phloem there
    are two layers of parenchyma representing, as regards position, a
    pericycle and an endodermis. In the ordinary pericycle and endodermis
    of the roots of most plants the cells of the two layers are on
    alternate radii, but in the Calamite root, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span> <i>Equisetum</i>
    roots, the cells of these layers are placed on the same radii, as seen
    in the neighbourhood of <i>x<sup>2</sup></i> in the figure. This correspondence
    of the radial walls of the endodermal and pericyclic cells points to
    the development of both layers from one mother-layer, and suggests the
    ‘double endodermis’ or phloeoterma of <i>Equisetum</i> (p. 254). The
    cells in the outer of these two layers have slight thickenings on the
    radial walls recalling the usual character of endodermal cells. The
    phloeoterma is succeeded by a few layers of parenchyma, constituting
    the inner cortex, and beyond this we have the large lacunae separated
    from one another by slender trabeculae of cells. The outer cortex is
    limited by a well-defined layer of thick-walled cells, which may be
    spoken of as the <em>epidermoidal<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> layer</em>. Roots possessing this
    superficial layer of thicker cells have no doubt lost the original
    surface-layer which produced the absorptive root-hairs.</p>

  <p>The xylem elements have the form of spiral, reticulate and scalariform tracheids.</p>

  <p>In roots or rootlets smaller than that shown in fig. 91 <i>B</i>,
    the primary xylem may extend to the centre of the stele, and form
    a continuous axial strand; in such examples the structure may be
    diarch, triarch or tetrarch. The origin of the cambium agrees
    with that in recent roots, the cells immediately external to the
    protoxylem tracheids become meristematic, as also those internal to
    the phloem. Another root-character is seen in the endogenous origin
    of lateral members. Good examples of branching roots are figured by
    Williamson<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> and by Williamson and Scott<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>.</p>

  <p>Older roots<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> are usually found in a decorticated condition. A
    transverse section of root in which secondary thickening has been
    active for some time presents on a superficial view a close resemblance
    to a stem of <i>Calamites</i>, but a careful comparison at once reveals
    important points of difference. The specimen <span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>diagrammatically sketched
    in fig. 92 illustrates very clearly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span> origin of a root from the
    node of a Calamite stem. The section has passed through a stem in a
    tangential direction, showing the characteristic arrangement of the
    vascular bundles <i>x</i>, and principal medullary rays <i>m</i>.
    The small leaf-traces, <i>t</i>, <i>t</i>, afford another feature
    characteristic of a Calamite stem. The portion of stem to the right of
    the figure has been slightly displaced, and between this piece and the
    root <i>R</i>, one of the ubiquitous Stigmarian appendages, <i>s</i>,
    has inserted itself. At <i>R</i> a fairly thick and decorticated root
    is seen in oblique transverse section; at the upper end the root
    tracheids are seen in direct continuity with the xylem of the stem. In
    the centre of the root is the large solid pith surrounded by twelve
    bluntly pointed xylem groups, composed in the main of radially disposed
    scalariform elements with narrow secondary medullary rays like those in
    a stem. Between each xylem group there is a broad medullary ray, which
    tapers rapidly towards the outside, and is soon obliterated by the
    formation of interfascicular secondary xylem. At <i>R′</i> a portion of
    another root is seen in transverse section, and <i>R″</i> the inner
    part of a single xylem group is shown more clearly. The solid pith and
    the absence of carinal canals are the two most obvious distinguishing
    features of the roots.</p>

  <p>As Renault points out, roots of <i>Calamites</i> have been figured by
    some writers<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> as examples of stems, but it is usually comparatively
    easy to distinguish between roots and stems. On examining the xylem
    groups more closely, one notices that the apex of each is occupied by
    a triangular group of centripetally-developed primary tracheids, the
    narrow spiral protoxylem elements occupying the outwardly directed
    apex. The protoxylem apex is usually followed externally by a ray of
    one or two radially disposed series of parenchymatous cells. This ray
    is not distinguished in fig. 92 <i>R″</i> from the rows of xylem
    tracheids. Each xylem group is thus formed partly of centripetal xylem
    and in part of secondary centrifugal xylem; the latter is associated
    with secondary medullary rays, as in stems, and contains a broader
    ray (<em>fascicular ray</em> of Williamson <span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>and Scott<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>) immediately
    opposite each protoxylem strand. In the roots of recent plants
    (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Cucurbita</i>, <i>Phaseolus</i>, &amp;c.) a broad medullary
    ray is often found opposite the protoxylem, and such an arrangement is
    a perfectly normal structure in roots<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>.</p>

  <p>Renault has recently described several species of Calamite roots which
    he designates by specific names, some of them belonging to stems with
    the <i>Arthropitys</i> structure, and others to <i>Calamodendron</i>.
    Some of the roots figured by the French author have an axial strand
    of xylem with 7–15 projecting angles of protoxylem<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>. These he
    considers true roots, but the larger specimens with a wide pith he
    prefers to regard as stolons. In the latter he mentions the union
    of the primary centripetal with the secondary centrifugal wood as a
    distinguishing feature. It has been shown, however, that each group of
    secondary xylem includes a median ray of parenchyma, and that the whole
    structure is essentially that of a root, and not that of a modified
    stem or stolon. The organs described by Renault as true roots are
    probably rootlets, and as Williamson and Scott have demonstrated, there
    is every gradation between the smaller specimens with a solid xylem
    axis and those with a large central pith.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that Renault’s figures of
    <i>Calamodendron</i> roots show the closest resemblance to those of the
    subgenus <i>Arthropitys</i>.</p>

  <h5 id="Calamites_Cones"><i>d. Cones.</i></h5>

  <p>The occurrence of fossil plants in the form of isolated fragments is a
    constant source of difficulty, and is well illustrated by the numerous
    examples of strobili which cannot be connected with their parent
    stems. We are, however, usually able to recognise Calamitean cones
    if the impressions or petrified specimens are fairly well preserved,
    but it is seldom possible to correlate particular types of cones with
    the corresponding species of foliage-shoots or stems. Palaeobotanical
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>literature contains numerous illustrations and descriptions of
    long and narrow strobili designated by different generic terms such
    as <i>Volkmannia</i>, <i>Brukmannia</i>, <i>Calamostachys</i>,
    <i>Macrostachya</i> and others; many of these have since been
    recognised as the cones of <i>Calamites</i>, while some species of
    <i>Volkmannia</i> have been identified with <i>Sphenophyllum</i> stems.
    Before further considering the general question of Calamite cones, a
    few examples may be described in detail as types of fructification
    which are known to have been borne by <i>Calamites</i>. The examples
    selected are species of the two provisional genera <i>Calamostachys</i>
    and <i>Palaeostachya</i>.</p>

  <p>The usual form of a Calamite cone is illustrated in fig. 93, which
    represents a fertile shoot bearing a few narrow linear leaves of the
    <i>Calamocladus</i> type; in the axils of some of these are borne the
    long strobili.</p>

  <h5 id="Calamostachys_Binneyana"><i>Calamostachys Binneyana</i> (Carr.). Figs. 94 and 95.</h5>

  <p>In 1867 Carruthers<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> gave an account of the structural features
    of the species of cones named by him <i>Volkmannia Ludwigi</i>
    and <i>V. Binneyi</i>, the generic term having been originally
    used by Sternberg<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> for some impressions of Carboniferous
    strobili. Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> in 1849 referred to the various forms of
    <i>Volkmannia</i> as cones of Asterophyllitean branches, and the
    latter he regarded as the foliage-shoots of a Calamite stem. In 1868
    Binney<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> published a description, with several illustrations, of
    the cones named by Carruthers <i>Volkmannia Binneyi</i>, and referred
    to them as the fructification of that type of Calamite stem spoken of
    in a previous section of this chapter (p. 311) as <i>Calamites</i>
    (<i>Arthropitys</i>) <i>communis</i> (Binney). This cone is now
    usually spoken of as <i>Calamostachys Binneyana</i>; the specific
    name <i>Binneyana</i> being suggested by Schimper<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> in 1869 as
    more euphonious than that proposed by Carruthers. In recent years our
    knowledge of both <i>C. Binneyana</i> and <i>C. Ludwigi</i> has been
    considerably extended. We shall confine our attention in the following
    account to the former species<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>. Some excellent figures of the
    latter species may be found in Weiss’ Memoir<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> on Calamarieae.</p>

  <p>One of the largest examples of <i>Calamostachys Binneyana</i> so far
    recorded has a length of 3–4 cm. and a maximum diameter of about 7·5
    mm. The axis of the cone bears whorls of sterile leaves or bracts at
    equal distances; the linear bracts of each whorl are coherent basally
    as a disc or plate of tissue attached at right angles to the central
    axis of the cone. The periphery of each of these discs divides up into
    twelve linear segments, which curve upwards in a direction more or less
    parallel to the strobilus axis, and at right angles to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>coherent
    portion of each whorl. The manner of occurrence of the whorls is
    shown in fig. 94, which has been sketched from a large section in the
    Williamson collection. The segments of the successive sterile verticils
    alternate with one another, so that in the surface-view of a cone the
    long and narrow free bracts appear spirally disposed. Midway between
    these alternating sterile verticils there is a series of fertile
    appendages, also given off in regular whorls. Each fertile whorl
    consists of about half as many members as the segments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span> of a sterile
    whorl, and the members of the several fertile whorls are superposed and
    not alternate. Each member has the form of a stalk or sporangiophore
    given off at right angles from the cone axis; this is expanded distally
    into a peltate disc bearing four sporangia attached to its inner face.
    In fig. 94 we can only see the basal portions of the sporangiophores,
    which are shown in the upper part of the sketch as pointed projections,
    <i>Sp</i>, from the cone axis. Each sporangiophore is traversed by a
    vascular strand which sends off a branch to the base of a sporangium
    (fig. 95, A, <i>t</i>).</p>

      (From specimen no. 1022 in the Williamson Collection, British Museum.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The axis of the cone is occupied by a single stele, usually triangular
    in section; the stele consists of a solid pith of elongated cells
    surrounded by six vascular bundles, two at each corner. A somewhat
    irregular gap marks the position of the protoxylem of each strand,
    and portions of spiral or annular tracheids may occasionally be
    seen in the cavity. These cavities, which may be spoken of as the
    carinal canals, disappear at the nodes, where there is a mass of
    short reticulately pitted tracheids, as in a Calamite stem. Vascular
    bundles pass upwards in an oblique direction from the central stele
    to supply the bracts, each of which is traversed by a single strand
    of tracheids. The coherent portion, or disc, of each sterile whorl
    consists of sclerenchymatous elements towards the upper surface, and
    of parenchyma below. The pedicel of the sporangiophores consists of
    fairly thick-walled cells traversed by a single vascular strand,
    and the peltate distal portions are made up of parenchymatous cells
    arranged in a palisade-like form at right angles to the free surface
    of the sporangiophores. The vascular strand of the pedicel forks into
    two halves just below the peltate head, and these branches again
    bifurcate to send a branch to each sporangium. The four sporangia of
    each sporangiophore are attached by a narrow band of tissue to the
    shield-shaped distal expansion (fig. 95, A).</p>

  <p>In a tangential section of a cone, such as the lower portion of fig.
    94 and in fig. 95, B, the sporangiophores present the appearance of
    narrow stalks (fig. 95, B, <i>a</i>) in the middle of a cluster of
    sporangia, and the latter appear more or less square in outline. The
    wall of a sporangium is made of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span> single layer of cells (fig. 95, B)
    which present a characteristic appearance in surface-view (fig. 95, C),
    the thin walls being crossed at right angles by small vertical plates.
    In the tangential section of the coherent sterile whorls (fig. 95, B,
    <i>b</i> and <i>b</i>) the vascular strands are occasionally seen in
    transverse section (fig. 95, B, <i>t</i>), as they pass outwards to the
    several free bracts.</p>

  <p>The spores in <i>Calamostachys Binneyana</i> are all of the same
    size, and no macrospores have ever been seen. In well preserved
    specimens tetrads of spores may be seen, still enclosed by the wall
    of the spore-mother-cell (fig. 95, A and D); and the torn remnants
    of the mother-cell sometimes simulate in appearance the elaters
    of an <i>Equisetum</i> spore. In surface-view a spore often shows
    clearly the three-rayed marking, which is a characteristic feature
    of daughter-cells formed in a tetrad from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span> mother-cell. The spores
    of a tetrad are in some cases of unequal size, some having developed
    more vigorously than others. This unequal growth and nourishment of
    spores is clearly shown in fig. 96, which represents a sporangium
    of a heterosporous Calamitean strobilus, <i>C. Casheana</i>.
    Williamson and Scott<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> have described striking examples of
    spores in different stages of abortion, and these authors draw
    attention to the importance of the phenomenon from the point of
    view of the origin of a heterosporous form of cone. The abortion of
    some of the members of a spore-tetrad and the consequent increased
    nutrition of the more favoured daughter-cells, might well be the
    starting-point of a process, which would ultimately lead to the
    production of well defined macrospores and microspores. The young
    microsporangia and macrosporangia of recent Vascular Cryptogams such
    as <i>Selaginella</i>, <i>Salvinia</i> and other heterosporous genera
    are identical in appearance<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>; it is not until the spore-producing
    tissue begins to differentiate into groups of spores, that the
    sporangia assume the form of macrosporangia and microsporangia.
    During the evolution of the various known types of pteridophytic
    plants heterospory gradually succeeded isospory, and this no doubt
    occurred several times and in different phyla of the plant kingdom.
    In the mature sporangia of some of the Calamitean strobili we have
    in the inequality of the spores in one sporangium an indication of
    the steps by which heterospory arose; and in the immature sporangia
    of some recent genera we are carried back to a stage still nearer
    the starting-point of the substitution of the heterosporous for the
    isosporous condition.</p>

  <h5 id="C_Casheana"><i>Calamostachys Casheana</i> Will. Fig. 96.</h5>

  <p>To Williamson<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> again is largely due the information we possess as
    to the structure of this type of Calamitean strobilus. Its special
    interest lies in the occurrence of macrospores and microspores in the
    same cone.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span></p>

  <p>The strobilus axis agrees in structure with that of <i>C.
    Binneyana</i>, but in <i>C. Casheana</i> a band of secondary xylem
    forms the peripheral portion of the triangular stele. Were any further
    proof needed of the now well-established fact that secondary growth
    in thickness is by no means unknown as an attribute of Vascular
    Cryptogams, the co-existence in the same cone of a cambium layer
    producing secondary wood and bark, and cryptogamic macrospores and
    microspores, affords conclusive evidence<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>. The dogma accepted
    by many writers for a considerable number of years that the power
    of secondary thickening is evidence against a cryptogamic affinity,
    has been responsible for no little confusion in palaeobotanical
    nomenclature.</p>

  <p>On the axis of <i>Calamostachys Casheana</i> there are borne alternate
    whorls of fertile and sterile appendages similar to those in the
    homosporous <i>C. Binneyana</i>, but they are inclined more obliquely
    to the axis of the cone. Macrospores and microspores have been found in
    sporangia borne on the same sporangiophore.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The spore-tetrads in the macrosporangia occasionally include <span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>aborted
    sister-cells like those noticed in <i>C. Binneyana</i>; this
    phenomenon is well illustrated by the unequally nourished spores in
    the sporangium of fig. 96, but no such starved spores have been found
    in the microsporangia. In this cone, then, heterospory has become
    firmly established, but the occurrence of undersized spores in a
    macrospore-tetrad leads us back to the probable lines of development
    of heterospory, which are seen in <i>C. Binneyana</i> at their
    starting-point.</p>

  <p>In the two species of strobili which have been described,
    <i>Calamostachys Binneyana</i> and <i>C. Casheana</i>, the
    sporangiophores or sporophylls are given off at right angles to the
    axis, and midway between the sterile whorls. These are two of the most
    important distinguishing features of the Calamitean cones included
    under the generic term <i>Calamostachys</i>. In another form of cone,
    which also belongs to Calamitean stems, the sporangiophores arise in
    the axil of the sterile leaves, and are inclined obliquely to the axis
    of the cone. To this type the generic name <i>Palaeostachya</i> has
    been applied by the late Prof. Weiss<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> of Berlin. The portion of a
    cone shown in fig. 97 shows the arrangement of the sterile and fertile
    appendages characteristic of <i>Palaeostachya</i>.</p>

  <p>It is practically impossible to distinguish between cones of the
    <i>Calamostachys</i> and <i>Palaeostachya</i> type in the case of
    imperfectly preserved impressions; indeed we cannot assume that all
    long and narrow cones with spirally disposed verticillate bracts are
    Calamitean. We must have the additional <span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>evidence of internal structure
    or of the direct association of the cones with Calamitean foliage.</p>

  <h5 id="Palaeostachya_vera"><i>Palaeostachya vera</i> sp. nov. Fig. 98.</h5>

  <p>In 1869 Williamson<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> described a fragment of a strobilus which
    showed certain anatomical features indicative of a close relationship
    or even identity with <i>Calamites</i>. Some years later<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> a much
    more perfect example was obtained from the Coal-Measures of Lancashire,
    and the additional evidence which it afforded definitely confirmed
    the earlier views of Williamson. The cone was more fully described
    by Williamson in 1888, as “the true fruit of <i>Calamites</i>.” It
    is clearly a form of Weiss’ genus <i>Palaeostachya</i>; Williamson
    and Scott<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> refer to it in their Memoir as <i>Calamites
    pedunculatus</i>. It is preferable, however, to retain the generic
    designation <i>Palaeostachya</i> for cones of this type. As the name
    <i>P. pedunculata</i> has previously been adopted by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> for a
    cone figured by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> in 1874, and afterwards referred to
    by that author in writing as <i>P. pedunculata</i>, it is proposed to
    substitute the specific name <i>vera</i>; this specific name being
    chosen with a view to put on record the fact that it was this type of
    cone that Williamson first proved to be the <em>true</em> fructification
    of the Calamite.</p>

  <p>The axis of <i>P. vera</i> is practically identical in structure
    with a Calamitean twig. There is a hollow pith in the centre of the
    stele surrounded by a ring of 16–20 collateral bundles, each of which
    is accompanied by a carinal canal as in a vegetative shoot. As the
    pedicel of the strobilus passes into the cone proper it undergoes some
    modification in structure, but retains the characteristic features of
    a Calamite. The diagrammatic longitudinal section of fig. 98, which is
    copied from a drawing by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>, shows the broadening of the
    vascular strands at the nodes, and here and there a carinal canal is
    seen internal to the wood.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span></p>

  <p>The axis of the cone bears whorls of bracts at right angles to the
    central column. Each whorl consists of about 30–40 segments coherent
    basally into a disc of prosenchymatous and parenchymatous tissue.
    The free linear bracts curve sharply upwards from the periphery of
    the disc, approximately parallel to the axis of the cone. From each
    of these sterile whorls there are given off 16–20 long and slender
    obliquely-inclined sporangiophores, <i>sp</i>, which arise from the
    upper surface of the disc close to the axis. Each sporangiophore
    no doubt bore four sporangia, <i>S</i>, containing spores of one
    size,—about ·075 mm. in diameter. The specimens of <i>Palaeostachya
    vera</i> so far obtained do not show the actual manner of attachment
    of the sporangia, but more complete examples of other species of
    <i>Palaeostachya</i><a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> enable us to assume with certainty that the
    sporangiophores terminated in a distal peltate expansion bearing four
    sporangia on its inner face.</p>

  <p>A transverse section of the axis of the cone in the region of the
    sterile and fertile appendages shows the vascular bundles arranged
    in pairs. In a section through the peduncle of the cone, below the
    lowest whorl of bracts, the bundles of the stele are situated at equal
    distances apart. The cortical tissue of the peduncle is traversed by
    a ring of large canals<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> similar to the vallecular canals of an
    Equisetum stem.</p>

  <p>Isospory is not a constant characteristic of <i>Palaeostachya</i>; some
    forms have been found with macrospores and microspores<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>.</p>

  <div class="center mt3"><i>Other Calamitean cones, and examples illustrating the connection
    between Cones and Vegetative Shoots.</i></div>

  <p>It would be out of place in an introduction to Palaeobotany to attempt
    an exhaustive account of the various cones which were probably borne
    by Calamitean plants, but there are a few general points to which
    the attention of the student should be directed. The examples dealt
    with in the foregoing description illustrate the fact, that plants
    included under the comprehensive genus <i>Calamites</i> bore cones
    possessing distinct morphological features. There are, however,
    other types of strobili which have been found in organic connection
    with <i>Calamites</i>; and some of these must be taken into account
    in dealing with Calamarian plants. The genera <i>Volkmannia</i>,
    <i>Brukmannia</i>, <i>Huttonia</i>, <i>Macrostachya</i>, in addition
    to <i>Calamostachys</i> and <i>Palaeostachya</i> and others, have been
    applied by different writers to Calamitean cones. As Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
    has suggested, it is wiser to discard <i>Volkmannia</i> and
    <i>Brukmannia</i>, as they have been made to do duty for cones of
    widely different forms. It is better to adhere to the provisional
    generic names used by Weiss, as they enable us to conveniently
    systematise the various Calamarian strobili.</p>

  <p>The following classification may be given of the better known cones,
    some of which we are able to describe in considerable detail, while
    others are still very imperfectly known. We have good evidence that
    all these strobili were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>borne by vegetative shoots of the type of
    <i>Calamites</i>, <i>Calamocladus</i> or <i>Annularia</i>.</p>

  <h5 id="Calamostachys">1. <i>Calamostachys</i><a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> (including <i>Paracalamostachys</i> and
    <i>Stachannularia</i>).</h5>

  <p>Cones long and narrow, consisting of a central axis bearing alternate
    whorls of sterile and fertile appendages, the latter having the form of
    sporangiophores attached at right angles to the axis midway between the
    sterile verticils, and bearing four sporangia on the inner face of a
    peltate distal expansion.</p>

  <p><i>Calamostachys Binneyana</i> Schimp., <i>C. Ludwigi</i> Carr., <i>C.
    Casheana</i> Will., may be referred to as examples of this type of
    cone; also some of the strobili described by different authors as
    species of <i>Volkmannia</i><a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>, <i>Brukmannia</i><a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Although one cannot make out the detailed structure of a Calamite cone
    in the absence of internal structure, it is often possible to recognise
    the essential features in specimens preserved in ironstone nodules,
    such as those from Coalbrook Dale in Shropshire, or by carefully
    examining the carbonised impressions on shale under a simple microscope.</p>

  <p>Weiss applies the term <i>Paracalamostachys</i><a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> to cones of the
    <i>Calamostachys</i> form, but in which the manner of attachment cannot
    be made out. Such a cone as that of fig. 93 should probably be referred
    to this sub-type of <i>Calamostachys</i> in the absence of definite
    evidence as to the position of the sporangia.</p>

  <p>Another term <i>Stachannularia</i>, originally used by Weiss as a
    genus<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>, was afterwards<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> applied to cones of the same general
    type as <i>Calamostachys</i>, in which the sporangiophores have
    the form of thorn-like structures bearing on their upper side a
    lamellar expansion. There is however some doubt as to the correct
    interpretation of the features associated with cones included in
    <i>Stachannularia</i>; for an account of such forms <span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>reference must be
    made to the writings of Weiss, Renault<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>, Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> and
    others<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>.</p>

  <p><i>Calamostachys</i> cones have been found in organic union with
    branches bearing leaves of the <i>Annularia</i> type, also with
    <i>Calamocladus</i> foliage, and the branches bearing such cones have
    been found in actual connection with Calamitean stems. The association
    of cones and vegetative stems and branches is shown in tabular form on
    p. 363.</p>

  <h5>2. <i>Palaeostachya<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>.</i></h5>

  <p>In this genus the general habit agrees with that of
    <i>Calamostachys</i>, and in imperfectly preserved specimens it
    may be impossible to discriminate between <i>Calamostachys</i>
    and <i>Palaeostachya</i>. The latter form is characterised by the
    attachment of the sporangiophores in the axil of the sterile bracts, or
    immediately above them, as shown in figs. 97 and 98.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Examples.</span> <i>Palaeostachya vera</i> sp. nov., <i>P.
    pedunculata</i> Will. afford examples of this form of strobilus.
    The genus <i>Palaeostachya</i> includes several species previously
    described under the genus <i>Volkmannia</i><a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>.</p>

  <p>Strobili of this generic type are known in organic association
    with Annularian branches, as well as with <i>Calamocladus</i> and
    <i>Calamites</i>.</p>

  <h5>3. <i>Macrostachya.</i></h5>

  <p>This generic name was originally applied by Schimper<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> to certain
    forms of Calamitean stems, of the type afterwards referred to the
    sub-genus <i>Calamitina</i> by Weiss, bearing long and thick cones.
    The name is, however, more appropriately restricted to strobili,
    which differ from the two preceding genera in their greater length
    (14–16 cm.) and in the more crowded and imbricating whorls of bracts.
    The internodes of the cones are very short, and each whorl of bracts
    consists of about 20 coherent members separated at the periphery
    of the disc <span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>into short pointed teeth. The internal structure of
    <i>Macrostachya</i> has not been satisfactorily determined. An account
    by Renault<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> of a petrified specimen does not present a very clear
    idea as to the structural features of this form of Calamitean strobilus.</p>

  <p>The generic name <i>Huttonia</i>, suggested by Sternberg<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> in 1837,
    is applied to cones which closely resemble <i>Macrostachya</i> in
    habit, but differ—so far as our scanty knowledge enables us to judge—in
    the arrangement of the members. The student <span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>must refer to Weiss<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>,
    Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> and other writers<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> for a further account of
    these types, and of another rare and little-known form of cone, called
    by Weiss Cingularia<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>.</p>

  <p>Macrostachyan cones have been found attached to stems of
    <i>Calamites</i> which are included in the sub-genus <i>Calamitina</i>
    (p. 367). The larger size of <i>Macrostachya</i> as a distinguishing
    feature is not always a safe test; some cones which belong to
    <i>Palaeostachya</i> [<i>e.g.</i> <i>P. arborescens</i> Sternb.] and
    <i>Calamostachys</i> (<i>e.g.</i> <i>C. Solmsi</i>) are much thicker
    and larger than the majority of species of these two genera.</p>

  <p>It would appear from the examples selected to illustrate the
    connection between strobili and vegetative shoots, that the
    <i>Annularia</i> type of branch usually bears cones which conform
    to the genus <i>Calamostachys</i> (<i>Stachannularia</i>); while
    the Asterophyllitean branches—<i>Calamocladus</i>—are associated
    with <i>Palaeostachya</i> and <i>Macrostachya</i>. But this rule is
    not constant, and we are not in a position to speak of cones of a
    particular type as necessarily characteristic of definite types of
    Calamitean shoots.</p>

  <p>Although it is admitted by the great majority of Palaeobotanists that
    the Calamites were all true Vascular Cryptogams, the older view that
    some members of the Calamarieae are gymnospermous has not been given up
    by Renault<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>. This observer has recently described some seeds which
    he believes were borne by Calamitean stems; he admits, however, that no
    undoubted female cones of <i>Calamodendron</i> have so far been found.
    In view of the unsatisfactory evidence on which Renault’s opinion is
    based, we need not further discuss the questions which he raises.</p>

    <i>Calamites</i> founded on pith-casts alone. Many of these so-called
    species are of little or no value botanically, but while we may admit
    the futility of attempting to recognise specific types in the same
    sense as in the determination of recent plants, it is necessary to
    pay attention to such characters as are likely to prove of value for
    descriptive and comparative purposes. From the nature of the specimens
    it is clear that many of the differences may be such as are likely to
    be met with in different branches of the same species, while in others
    the pith-casts of distinct species or genera may be almost identical.</p>

  <p>The most striking differences observable in Calamite casts are in the
    character of the internodes, the infranodal canals, the number and
    disposition of branch-scars, and other surface features. Occasionally
    it is possible to recognise certain anatomical characters in the coaly
    layer which often surrounds a shale- or sandstone-cast, and the surface
    of a well preserved cast may give a clue to the nature of the wood in
    the faint outlines of cells which can sometimes be detected on the cast
    itself<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>. The breadth of the carbonaceous envelope on a cast has
    been frequently relied on by some writers as an important character. It
    has been suggested<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> that we may arrive at the original thickness
    of the wood of a stem by measuring the coaly layer <span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>and multiplying
    the breadth by 27; the explanation being that a zone of wood 27 mm. in
    thickness is reduced in the process of carbonisation to a layer 1 mm.
    thick.</p>

  <p>The breadth of the coal on the same form of cast may vary considerably;
    on this account, and for various other reasons, such a character can
    have but little value. Our knowledge of anatomy may often help us
    to interpret certain features of internal casts and to appreciate
    apparently unimportant details. One occasionally notices that a
    Calamite pith-cast has large infranodal canals, and in some specimens
    each internodal ridge may be traversed by a narrow median line or small
    groove; large infranodal canal casts suggest the type of stem referred
    to the subgenus <i>Arthrodendron</i>, and the median line on the ridges
    may be due to bands of hard tissue in each principal medullary ray.</p>

  <p>In attempting to identify pith-casts the student must keep in view
    the probable differences presented by the branching rhizome, the main
    aerial branches and the finer shoots of the same individual. The long
    internodal ridges of some casts may be mistaken for the parallel
    veins of such a leaf as <i>Cordaites</i>, a Palaeozoic Gymnosperm,
    if there are no nodes visible on the specimen. The fossil figured
    by Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> as <i>Poacites</i>, and regarded by them
    as a Monocotyledon, is no doubt a portion of a Calamite with very
    long internodes. An interesting example of incorrect determination
    has recently been pointed out by Nathorst<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> in the case of
    certain casts from Bear Island, originally described by Heer as
    examples of <i>Calamites</i>; the vertical rows of leaf-trace casts
    on a <i>Knorria</i> were mistaken for the ribs of a Calamite stem.
    The specimens in the Stockholm Museum fully bear out Nathorst’s
    interpretation. The undulating course of internodal ridges and grooves
    is not in itself a character of specific value. If a Calamite stem were
    bent slightly, the wood and medullary-ray tissues on the concave side
    might adapt themselves to the shortening of the stem by becoming more
    or less folded, and a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>cast of such a stem would show undulating ridges
    and grooves on one side and straight ones on the other<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>.</p>

  <p>A convenient classification of Calamite casts was proposed by Weiss
    in 1884, founded chiefly on the number and manner of occurrence
    of branch-scars—or rather branch-depressions—on the surface
    of pith-casts. Weiss<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> recognised the imperfection of his
    proposed grouping, and Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> has also expressed reasonable
    doubts as to the scientific value of such group-characters. Weiss
    instituted three subgenera—<i>Calamitina</i>, <i>Eucalamites</i> and
    <i>Stylocalamites</i>, which are made use of as convenient terms in
    descriptive treatment of Calamite casts. The following account of a few
    of the more typical casts may serve to illustrate the methods employed
    in the description of such specimens; the synonomy given for the
    different species is not intended to be complete, but it is added with
    a view to drawing attention to the necessity for careful comparison in
    systematic work.</p>

  <p>This sub-genus of <i>Calamites</i>, as instituted by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>,
    includes Calamitean stems or branches, which are characterised by the
    periodic occurrence of branch-whorls usually represented by fairly
    large oval or circular scars just above a nodal line (figs. 99, 100
    and 101). The branch-scars may form a row of contiguous discs, or a
    whorl may consist of a smaller number of branches which are not in
    contact basally. A form described by Weiss as <i>C. pauciramis</i>,
    Weiss<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>, has only one branch in each whorl, as represented by
    a single large oval scar on some of the nodes of the cast. A stem
    of this form is by no means a typical <i>Calamitina</i>, but it
    serves to show the existence of forms connecting Weiss’ sub-genera
    <i>Calamitina</i> and <i>Eucalamites</i>. The number of internodes and
    nodes between the branch whorls varies in different specimens, and is
    indeed not constant in the same plant. Each nodal line bears numerous
    elliptical scars which mark the points of attachment of leaves; each
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>branch-whorl is situated immediately above a node, and in some forms
    this nodal line pursues a somewhat irregular course across the stem,
    following the outlines of the several branch-scars<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>. The surface
    of the internodes is either perfectly smooth or it is more frequently
    traversed by short longitudinal ridges or grooves probably representing
    fissures in the bark of the living stem; these are indicated by lines
    in fig. 99 and by elongated elliptical ridges in fig. 101. On young
    stems the leaves are occasionally found in place, as for example in
    an example figured by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> (<i>C. Göpperti</i>), or we may have
    leaf-verticils still in place in much older and thicker branches<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>
    (cf. fig. 85, p. 330).</p>

  <p>It occasionally happens that the bark of <i>Calamitina</i> stems has
    been preserved as a detached shell<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> reminding one of the sheets of
    Birch bark often met with in forests, the separation being no doubt due
    in the fossil as in the recent trees to the manner of occurrence of the
    cork-cambium.</p>

  <p>In a few cases branches have been preserved still attached to a stem
    or branch of higher order; examples of such specimens are figured by
    Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>, Stur<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>, and others. Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> has
    given an idealised drawing of a typical <i>Calamitina</i> bearing a
    whorl of branches with the foliage and habit of <i>Asterophyllites
    equisetiformis</i>. The specimen on which this drawing is based <span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>is
    in the Natural History Museum, Paris; it shows Asterophyllitean
    branches in organic connection with a Calamitean stem, but it is
    not quite clear if the stem is a true <i>Calamitina</i>. A large
    drawing of this interesting specimen is given by Stur<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> in his
    monograph on <i>Calamites</i>, also a smaller sketch by Renault<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
    in his <cite>Cours de botanique fossile</cite>. Similar branches of the
    <i>Asterophyllites</i> type attached to an undoubted <i>Calamitina</i>
    are figured also by Lindley and Hutton. There is, in short,
    good evidence that stems of this sub-genus bore branches with
    Asterophyllitean shoots.</p>

  <p>The wood of stems of the Calamitina group of <i>Calamites</i>, in
    some instances at least, was of the <i>Arthropitys</i> type; this has
    been shown to be the case in some French specimens from the Commentry
    coal-field<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> and in others described by Stur<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>. The pith-casts of
    <i>Calamitina</i> are characterised by comparatively short internodes
    separated by deep nodal constrictions, as shown in fig. 100. From
    Permian specimens from Neu Paka in Bohemia, described by Stur<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>, we
    learn that there were the usual Calamite diaphragms bridging across
    the wide pith-cavity at each node. Such a cast as that shown in fig.
    100 is often referred to as <i>Calamites approximatus</i> Brongn.; the
    length of the internodes and the periodic occurrence of branch-scars
    in the form of circular or oval depressions along a nodal line enable
    us to recognise the <i>Calamitina</i> casts. Weiss<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> points out
    that in pith-casts of this form the branch-scars occur on the nodal
    constriction, and not immediately above the node as is the case on the
    surface of a typical <i>Calamitina</i>. This distinction is however
    of little or no value; the point of attachment of a branch may be
    above the nodal line, while on the pith-cast of the same stem the
    point of origin of the vascular bundles of the branch is on the nodal
    constriction<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>.</p>

  <p>The specimen shown in fig. 100 illustrates the appearance of a
    <i>Calamitina</i> cast. There is a verticil of branch-scars on the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>lowest nodal constriction; on the right of the pith-cast the broad
    band of wood is faintly indicated by the smooth surface of the rock
    (<i>x</i>). Other examples demonstrating the existence of a broad woody
    cylinder in <i>Calamitina</i> stems have been figured by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> and
    other writers, and some good examples may be seen in the British Museum.</p>

  <p>We have so far noticed the connection of certain forms of pith-casts
    (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Calamites approximatus</i>), and Asterophyllitean
    shoots with stems of the sub-genus <i>Calamitina</i>.</p>

  <p>As regards the strobili our knowledge is far from satisfactory.
    Stur<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> figures some fertile branches bearing long and narrow
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>strobili, either <i>Palaeostachya</i> or <i>Calamostachys</i>, in
    close association with <i>Calamitina</i> stems, and Renault and
    Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> give illustrations of the association of <i>Calamitina</i>
    stems with large strobili of the <i>Macrostachya</i> form.</p>

  <p>Before Weiss proposed the term <i>Calamitina</i>, various authors
    had figured this form of Calamite under a distinct generic name
    (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Hippurites</i> of Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>,
    <i>Cyclocladia</i><a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>, <i>Macrostachya</i><a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>, &amp;c.). Stems of
    this type have also been described by more recent writers under
    different names, and considerable confusion has been caused by the
    use of numerous generic designations for forms of <i>Calamitina</i>.
    Some small fragments of <i>Calamitina</i> stems were described by
    Salter<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> in 1863 as portions of a new species of the Crustacean
    <i>Eurypterus</i> (<i>E. mammatus</i>). In 1869 Grand’Eury proposed the
    generic name <i>Calamophyllites</i><a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> for stems bearing verticils
    of <i>Asterophyllites</i> shoots; his description of such stems agrees
    with Weiss’ <i>Calamitina</i>, but as Grand’Eury’s name is used in a
    narrower sense as implying a connection with <i>Asterophyllites</i>,
    it is more convenient to adopt Weiss’ term in spite of the priority
    of <i>Calamophyllites</i>. In the <cite>Fossil flora of Commentry</cite> we
    find some flattened stems of the <i>Calamitina</i> type described under
    different generic names, as <i>Arthropitys approximatus</i><a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> and as
    <i>Macrostachya</i><a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>.</p>

  <p>The determination of distinct species of the sub-genus
    <i>Calamitina</i> is rendered almost hopeless by the variation in the
    different branches of the same individual, and by the difficulty of
    connecting surface-impressions with casts of the pith-cavity.</p>

  <p>A typical example of the <i>Calamitina</i> type of <i>Calamites</i> was
    figured by Sternberg<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> in 1821 as <i>Calamites varians</i>. This
    has been adopted by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> as a comprehensive species including
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>several different ‘forms’ of stems, which differ from Sternberg’s
    fossil in such points as the number of nodes between the branch-whorls
    and the number of branches in each whorl. The result of this system of
    nomenclature is the separation of portions of one specific type under
    different form-names. It must be clearly recognised that accurate
    specific diagnoses are practically impossible when we have to deal
    with fragments of plants, some of which are mere pith-casts, while
    others show the surface features. The specimen represented in fig.
    99 agrees with a stem described by Ettingshausen<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> in 1855 as
    <i>Calamites Göpperti</i>, and as a matter of convenience a member of
    the <i>Calamitina</i> group showing such characters may be referred to
    as <i>Calamites</i> (<i>Calamitina</i>) <i>Göpperti</i> (Ett.). The
    following list, which includes a few synonyms of this form, may suffice
    to illustrate the difficulties connected with accurate systematic
    determinations.</p>

  <p>This species is characterised by the smooth bark, which may be
    traversed by a few irregular longitudinal fissures; most of the nodes
    bear a series of small leaf-scars, and at fairly regular intervals a
    node is immediately succeeded by a circle of contiguous branch-scars,
    8–12 in a whorl. The pith-cast of this type of stem has short ribbed
    internodes separated by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>rather deep nodal constrictions; the
    branch-whorls being represented by a series of pits on the nodal
    constrictions recurring at corresponding intervals to the whorls of
    branch-scars on the surface of the stem. Leaves narrow and linear
    in form, like those on Asterophyllitean branches, are occasionally
    associated with this type of stem.</p>

  <p>The fragment of a <i>Calamitina</i> stem shown in fig. 101 is the
    counterpart of a specimen originally figured by Steinhauer<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> in 1818
    as a species of <i>Phytolithus</i>. This may be specifically identical
    with <i>C. Göpperti</i>; but it is better to speak of so small a
    specimen as merely one of the <i>Calamitina</i> stems, to be compared
    with <i>Calamites</i> (<i>Calamitina</i>) <i>Göpperti</i>. The specimen
    measures 14·5 cm. in length and 7 cm. in breadth.</p>

  <p>The form of pith-cast represented in fig. 100 is no doubt that of
    one of the <i>Calamitina</i> species, but as it is seldom possible
    to determine the connection between such casts and the particular
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>species of stems to which they belong, they are often referred to as
    <i>Calamites</i> (<i>Calamitina</i>) <i>approximatus</i> (Brongn.). The
    specimen of which fig. 100 is a photograph was originally described and
    figured by Mr Kidston<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> from the lower Coal-Measures of Ayrshire.
    Both <i>Calamites</i> (<i>Calamitina</i>) <i>Göpperti</i> (Ett.)
    and <i>C.</i> (<i>Calamitina</i>) <i>approximatus</i> (Brongn.) are
    recorded from the Transition, Middle and Lower Coal-Measures<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>.</p>

  <h5 id="Stylocalamites">B. <i>Stylocalamites.</i></h5>

  <p>In the members of this sub-genus the branch-scars are either irregular
    in their occurrence or absent. In some Calamites the branch-scars are
    very few and far between, and other species appear to have been almost
    without branches; pith-casts of such stems may be referred to the
    sub-genus <i>Stylocalamites</i><a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>.</p>

  <p>An exceedingly common Calamitean cast, <i>C. Suckowi</i> Brongn.
    (fig. 82) affords a good illustration of this type of stem. In the
    specimen shown in fig. 82 we have a cast of a rhizome, which is rather
    exceptional in showing three branches in connection with one another.
    The appearance of the fossil suggests a rhizome, rather than an aerial
    shoot, bearing lateral branches; the narrowing of the branches and the
    rapid decrease in the length of the internodes towards the point of
    attachment being features associated with rhizomes rather than with
    aerial branches.</p>

  <p>Casts of <i>Calamites Suckowi</i> are characterised by flat or slightly
    convex internodal ridges separated by shallow depressions, the ridges
    are rounded at the upper end of each internode, and usually bear
    circular casts of infranodal canals. There are some unusually large
    examples of casts of this species in the British Museum from the
    Radstock Coal-Measures; one of these has a length of 81 cm., and a
    diameter of 27 cm. Specimens are not infrequently found with verticils
    of slender roots in close proximity to the nodes of the cast; figures
    of such root-bearing casts have been given by Lindley and Hutton<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>,
    Weiss<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>, and other authors.</p>

  <p>Renault<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> has drawn attention to the thinness of the layer of wood
    which is often associated with large casts of <i>C. Suckowi</i>; he
    concludes that the stems must have possessed little or no secondary
    wood. In a more recent work by Grand’Eury<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> <i>Calamites Suckowi</i>
    is spoken of as having had wood of the <i>Calamodendron</i> type, but
    as wood of this kind has not been found in England, it is suggested
    that the plant may not have assumed an arborescent habit until late in
    the Coal-Measure period. During the Lower and Middle Coal-Measures,
    at which horizon it commonly occurs in England, it may have been
    herbaceous. This suggestion has little to commend it; the close
    agreement between <i>C. Suckowi</i> from English and French localities
    points to a plant of the same form, and we have no satisfactory
    evidence as to any difference in stem-structure in the two cases.</p>

  <p>Stur has figured a specimen of a Calamite cast, which he compares
    with <i>C. Suckowi</i>, surrounded by a band of silicified wood
    apparently of the <i>Arthropitys</i> type. From this and other
    facts it would appear probable that some of the English stems with
    the <i>Arthropitys</i> structure possessed casts referable to
    <i>Calamites</i> (<i>Stylocalamites</i>) <i>Suckowi</i>.</p>

  <p>We are not in a position to speak with confidence as to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>strobili of <i>C. Suckowi</i>, but Stur adduces evidence in support
    of a connection between this species of Calamite and certain
    Asterophyllitean branches (<i>Calamocladus equisetiformis</i>)
    bearing Calamostachyan cones. He does not appear to have found the
    foliage-shoots and stems in organic contact, but draws this conclusion
    from the association of the fertile branches and stems in the same
    rocks<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>. This species is abundant in the Lower, Middle and Upper
    Coal-Measures; it has also been recorded from the Millstone Grit<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>.</p>

  <h5 id="Eucalamites">C. <i>Eucalamites.</i></h5>

  <p>In this sub-genus branch-scars occur on every node; the scars never
    form a contiguous whorl as in <i>Calamitina</i>, but there may be from
    3 to 10 on each node. The scars of successive nodes often alternate in
    position, and thus form more or less regular vertical series as shown
    in fig. 102. The most obvious feature as regards the arrangement of
    the branch-scars is their spiral disposition on the surface of the
    pith-cast. The internodes are fairly uniform in length, and there is
    no periodic recurrence of narrower internodes as in <i>Calamitina</i>.
    From an examination of specimens of <i>Eucalamites</i> in which the
    pith-cast is covered with a coaly layer representing the carbonised
    remains of the wood and cortex, it would appear that the surface
    of the stems was practically smooth. The coaly investment on
    <i>Eucalamites</i> casts varies considerably in thickness<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>; it
    is very unsafe to make use of the thickness of this layer as a test
    of the breadth of the wood in Calamitean stems. The branch-scars as
    seen in a surface-view of a stem are situated a little above the
    nodal lines, while depressions on the pith-casts occur in the slight
    nodal constriction or immediately above it. Small leaf-scars have
    been described as occurring on the nodes between the branch-scars in
    specimens showing the surface features<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>.</p>

  <p>The species long known as <i>Calamites cruciatus</i> Sternb. is usually
    taken as the type of the sub-genus <i>Eucalamites</i>. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>Weiss<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>
    has subdivided this species into several ‘forms,’ which he bases on
    the number of branch-scars on each node and on other characters; a
    more extended subdivision of <i>C. cruciatus</i> has <span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>recently been
    made by Sterzel<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>, who admits the impossibility of separating the
    specific forms by means of the data at our disposal, but for purposes
    of geological correlation he prefers to express slight differences by
    means of definite ‘forms’ or varieties. The more comprehensive use
    of the specific name <i>cruciatus</i> as adopted by Zeiller in his
    <cite>Flore de Valenciennes</cite><a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> is, I believe, the better method
    to adopt. The specimen shown in fig. 102 affords a good example of
    a typical <i>Calamites cruciatus</i>, it was found in the Middle
    Coal-Measures near Barnsley, Yorkshire.</p>

    The casts of the <i>cruciatus</i> type have been found associated
    with wood possessing the structural features of the sub-genus
    <i>Calamodendron</i><a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>, but our knowledge of the structure of the
    stem, and of the fertile branches of <i>C. cruciatus</i> is very
    imperfect. A restoration of <i>Calamites</i> (<i>Eucalamites</i>)
    <i>cruciatus</i> is given by Stur<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> in his classic work on the
    Calamites, but he does not make quite clear the supposed connection
    with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>the stems and the fertile shoots of the Asterophyllites type<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>
    which he describes. Another member of the <i>Eucalamites</i> group,
    which is better known as regards its foliage-shoots, is <i>Calamites
    ramosus</i>, a species first described by Artis<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> in 1825. Stems of
    this species have been found in connection with the branches and leaves
    of the <i>Annularia</i>[6] type, bearing <i>Calamostachys</i><a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>
    cones. In all probability pith-casts included in the sub-genus
    <i>Eucalamites</i> belonged to stems with foliage-shoots and probably
    also with cones of more than one form.</p>

  <p>In the above account of a few common pith-casts it has been pointed
    out that there is occasionally satisfactory evidence for connecting
    certain casts with wood of a particular structure, and with sterile and
    fertile foliage-shoots of a definite type. It is, however, impossible
    in many cases to recognise with any certainty the leaf-bearing
    branches and strobili of the different casts of <i>Calamites</i>; it
    is equally impossible to determine what type of pith-cast or what type
    of foliage-shoots belongs to petrified stem-fragments in which it is
    possible to investigate the microscopical features. The scattered
    and piece-meal nature of the material on which our general knowledge
    of Calamitean plants is based, necessitates a system of nomenclature
    which is artificial and clumsy; but the apparent absurdity of attaching
    different names to fragments, which we believe to be portions of the
    same genus, is of convenience from the point of view of the geologist
    and the systematist. As our material increases it will be possible to
    further simplify the nomenclature for Calamarian plants, but it is
    unwise to allow our desire for a simpler terminology to lead us into
    proposals which are based rather on suppositions than on established
    fact. If it were possible to discriminate between pith-casts of
    stems having the different anatomical characters designated by the
    three sub-genera, <i>Arthropitys</i>, <i>Arthrodendron</i> and
    <i>Calamodendron</i>, the genus <i>Calamites</i> might be used in
    a much narrower and probably more natural sense than that which we
    have adopted. The tests made use of by some <span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>authors for separating
    pith-casts of <i>Calamodendron</i> and <i>Arthropitys</i> stems do not
    appear to be satisfactory; we want some term to apply to all Calamitean
    casts irrespective of the anatomical features of the stems, or of the
    precise nature of the foliage-branches. As used in the present chapter,
    <i>Calamites</i> stands for plants differing in certain features but
    possessing common structural characters, which must be defined in a
    broad sense so as to include types which may be worthy of generic
    rank, but which for convenience sake are included in a comprehensive
    generic name. The attempts to associate certain forms of foliage with
    <i>Arthropitys</i> on the one hand and with <i>Calamodendron</i>
    on the other, cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory; we still
    lack data for a trustworthy diagnosis of distinct Calamarian genera
    which shall include external characters as well as histological
    features. If we restricted the genus <i>Calamites</i> to stems with an
    <i>Arthropitys</i> structure and an Asterophyllitean foliage, we should
    be driven into unavoidable error. Within certain limits it is possible
    to distinguish generically or even specifically between petrified
    branches, and we already possess material enough for fairly complete
    diagnoses founded on internal structure; but it is not possible to
    make a parallel classification for pith-casts and foliage-shoots. For
    this reason, and especially bearing in mind the importance of naming
    isolated foliage-shoots and stem-casts for geological purposes, I
    believe it is better to admit the artificially wide application of
    the name <i>Calamites</i>, and to express more accurate knowledge,
    where possible, by the addition of a subgeneric term. In dealing with
    distinctions exhibited by Calamitean stems it may be advisable to make
    use of specific names, but we must keep before us the probability of
    the pith-cast and petrified stem-fragment of the same plant receiving
    different specific names. If the structural type is designated by a
    special sub-genus, this will tend to minimise the anomaly of using more
    than one binominal designation for what may be the same individual.</p>

  <h4 id="Conclusion">IV. Conclusion.</h4>

  <p>A brief sketch of the main features of <i>Calamites</i> suffices
    to bring out the many points of agreement between the arborescent
    Calamite plants and the recent Equisetums. The slight variation in
    morphological character among the present-day Horse-tails, contrasts
    with the greater range as regards structural features among the types
    included in <i>Calamites</i>. The Horse-tails probably represent one of
    several lines of development which tend to converge in the Palaeozoic
    period; the Calamite itself would appear to mark the culminating point
    of a certain phylum of which we have one degenerate but closely allied
    descendant in the genus <i>Equisetum</i>. We shall, however, be in a
    better position to consider the general question of plant-evolution
    after we have made ourselves familiar with other types of Palaeozoic
    plants. Grand’Eury’s<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> striking descriptions <span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>of forests of
    Calamites in the Coal-Measures of central France, enable us to form
    some idea of the habit of growth of these plants with their stout
    branching rhizomes and erect aerial shoots.</p>

  <p>By piecing together the evidence derived from different sources we
    may form some idea of the appearance of a living Calamite. A stout
    branching rhizome ascended obliquely or spread horizontally through
    sand or clay, with numerous whorls or tufts of roots penetrating into
    swampy soil. From the underground rhizome strong erect branches grew
    up as columnar stems to a height of fifty feet or more; in the lower
    and thicker portions the bark was fissured and somewhat rugged, but
    smoother nearer the summit. Looking up the stem we should see old and
    partially obliterated scars marking the position of a ring of lateral
    branches, and at a higher level tiers of branches given off at regular
    or gradually decreasing intervals, bearing on their upper portions
    graceful green branchlets with whorls of narrow linear leaves. On the
    younger parts of the main shoot rings of long and narrow leaves were
    borne at short intervals, several leaf-circles succeeding one another
    in the intervals between each radiating series of branches. On some
    of the leaf-bearing branchlets long and slender cones would be found
    here and there taking the place of the ordinary leafy twigs. Passing to
    the apical region of the stem the lateral branches given off at a less
    and less angle would appear more crowded, and at the actual tips there
    would be a crowded succession of leaf-segments forming a series of
    overlapping circles of narrow sheaths with thin slender teeth bending
    over the apex of the tree.</p>

  <p>Thus we may feebly attempt to picture to ourselves one of the many
    types of Calamite trees in a Palaeozoic forest, growing in a swampy
    marsh or on gently sloping ground on the shores of an inland sea, into
    which running water carried its burden of sand and mud, and broken
    twigs of Calamites and other trees which contributed to the Coal Period
    sediments. The large proportions of a Calamite tree are strikingly
    illustrated by some of the broad and long pith-casts occasionally
    seen in Museums; in the Breslau Collection there is a cast of a stem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
    belonging to the sub-genus <i>Calamitina</i>, which measures about 2 m.
    in length and 23 cm. in breadth, with 36 nodes. In the Natural History
    Museum, Paris, there is a cast nearly 2 metres long and more than 20
    cm. wide, which is referred to the sub-genus <i>Calamodendron</i>.</p>

  <h4 id="Archaeocalamites">E. ARCHAEOCALAMITES.</h4>

  <p>In the Upper Devonian and Culm rocks casts of a well-defined Calamitean
    plant are characteristic fossils; stems, leaf-bearing branches, roots
    and cones have been described by several authors, and the genus
    <i>Archaeocalamites</i> has been instituted for their reception.
    Although this genus agrees in certain respects with <i>Calamites</i>,
    and as recent work has shown this agreement extends to internal
    structure, it has been the custom to regard the Lower Carboniferous
    and Devonian plants as genetically distinct. The surface features of
    the stem-casts, the form of the leaves, and apparently the cones,
    possess certain distinctive characters which would seem to justify the
    retention of a separate generic designation.</p>

  <p>We may briefly summarise the characteristics of the genus as follows:—</p>

  <p>Pith-casts articulated, with very slightly constricted nodes; the
    internodes traversed by longitudinal ribs slightly elevated or
    almost flat, separated by shallow grooves. The ribs and grooves are
    continuous from one internode to another, and do not usually show the
    characteristic alternation of <i>Calamites</i><a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>. Along the nodal
    line there are occasionally found short longitudinal depressions,
    probably marking the points of origin of outgoing bundles. Branches
    were given off from the nodes without any regular order; a pith-cast
    may have branch-scars on many of the nodes, or there may be no trace
    of branches on casts consisting of several nodes. The leaves<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>
    are in whorls; in some cases they occur as free, linear, lanceolate
    leaves, or on younger branches they are long, filiform and repeatedly
    forked. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>The structure of the wood agrees with that of some forms of
    <i>Arthropitys</i>. The strobili consist of an articulated axis bearing
    whorls of sporangiophores, and each sporangiophore has four sporangia.
    Our knowledge of the fertile shoots is, however, very imperfect.</p>

  <p>Renault<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> has recently described the structure of the wood in
    some small silicified stems of <i>Archaeocalamites</i> from Autun.
    A large hollow pith is surrounded by a cylinder of wood consisting
    of wedge-shaped groups of xylem tracheids associated with secondary
    medullary rays; at the apex of each primary xylem group there is a
    carinal canal. The primary medullary rays appear to have been bridged
    across by bands of xylem at an early stage of secondary thickening, as
    in the Calamite of fig. 83, <i>D.</i></p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the cones of <i>Archaeocalamites</i> is far from
    satisfactory. Renault<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> has recently described a small fertile
    branch bearing a succession of verticils of sporangiophores; each
    sporangiophore stands at right angles to the axis of the cone and
    bears four sporangia, as in <i>Calamostachys</i>. It is not clear how
    far there is better evidence than that afforded by the association
    of the specimen with pith-casts of stems, for referring this cone to
    <i>Archaeocalamites</i>, but the association of vegetative and fertile
    shoots certainly suggests an organic connection. The cone described
    by the French author agrees with <i>Equisetum</i> in the absence
    of sterile bracts between the whorls of sporangiophores. It is an
    interesting fact that such a distinctly Equisetaceous strobilus is
    known to have existed in Lower Carboniferous rocks.</p>

  <p>Stur<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> has also described <i>Archaeocalamites</i> at considerable
    length; he gives several good figures of stem-casts and foliage-shoots
    bearing long and often forked narrow leaves. The same writer
    describes specimens of imperfectly preserved cones in which portions
    of whorls of forked filiform leaves are given off <span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>from the base of
    the strobilus<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>. Kidston<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> published an important memoir on
    the cones of <i>Archaeocalamites</i> in 1883, in which he advanced
    good evidence in support of the view that certain strobili, which
    were originally described as Monocotyledonous inflorescences, under
    the generic name <i>Pothocites</i><a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>, are the fertile shoots
    of this Calamarian genus. Kidston’s conclusions are based on the
    occurrence on the <i>Pothocites</i> cones, of leaves like those of
    <i>Archaeocalamites</i>, on the non-alternation of the sporangiophores
    of successive whorls, and on the close resemblance between his
    specimens and those described by Stur. Good specimens of the cones,
    formerly known as <i>Pothocites</i>, may be seen in the Botanical
    Museum in the Royal Gardens, Edinburgh; as they are in the form of
    casts without internal structure it is difficult to form a clear
    conception as to their morphological features.</p>

  <p>The fossils included under <i>Archaeocalamites</i> have been referred
    by different authors to various genera, and considerable confusion
    has arisen in both generic and specific nomenclature. The following
    synonomy of the best known species, <i>A. scrobiculatus</i> (Schloth.)
    illustrates the unfortunate use of several terms for the same plant.</p>

  <p>Some of the best specimens of this species are to be seen in the
    Museums of Breslau and Vienna, which contain the original examples
    described by Göppert and Stur. An examination of the original
    specimens, figured by Göppert under various names, enables one to
    refer them with confidence to the single species, <i>Archaeocalamites
    scrobiculatus</i>. The generic name <i>Archaeocalamites</i>, which has
    been employed by some authors, was suggested by Schimper<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> in 1862,
    as a subgenus of <i>Calamites</i>, on account of the occurrence of a
    deeply divided leaf-sheath, attached to the node of a pith-cast, which
    seemed to differ from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>the usual type of Calamitean leaf. The specimens
    described by Schimper are in the Strassburg Museum; the leaf-sheath
    which he figures is not very accurately represented.</p>

  <p>The example given in fig. 103 shews very clearly the continuous course
    of the ribs and grooves of the pith-cast. Each rib is traversed by a
    narrow median groove which would seem to represent the projecting edge
    of some hard tissue in the middle of each principal medullary ray of
    the stem. The specimen was found in a Carboniferous limestone quarry,
    Northumberland; there is a similar cast from the same locality in the
    Museum of the Geological Survey.</p>

  <h5><i>Affinities of</i> Archaeocalamites.</h5>

  <p>This genus agrees very closely with <i>Calamites</i> both in the
    anatomical structure of the stem and in the verticillate disposition
    of the leaves. The strobili appear to be Equisetaceous in character,
    and there is no satisfactory evidence of the existence of whorls of
    sterile bracts in the cone, such as occur in <i>Calamostachys</i> and
    in other Calamitean strobili. The continuous course of the vascular
    bundles of the stem from one internode to the next is the most striking
    feature in the ordinary specimens of the genus; but it sometimes
    happens that the grooves on a pith-cast shew the same alternation at
    the node as in <i>Calamites</i>. This is the case in a specimen in
    the Göppert collection in the Breslau Museum, and Feistmantel<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>
    has called attention to such an alternation in specimens from
    Rothwaltersdorf. In the true <i>Calamites</i>, on the other hand,
    the usual nodal alternation of the vascular strands is by no means
    a constant character<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>. Stur<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>, Rothpletz<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>, and other
    authors have pointed out the resemblance of <i>Archaeocalamites</i> to
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. The deeply divided leaves of some Sphenophyllums
    and those of <i>Archaeocalamites</i> are very similar in form; and the
    course of the vascular strands in <i>Sphenophyllum</i> may be compared
    with that in <i>Archaeocalamites</i>. But the striking difference in
    the structure <span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>of the stele forms a wide gap between the two genera.
    We have evidence that the Calamites and Sphenophyllums were probably
    descended from a common ancestral stock, and it may be that in
    <i>Archaeocalamites</i>, some of the <i>Sphenophyllum</i> characters
    have been retained; but there is no close affinity between the two
    plants.</p>

  <p>On the whole, considering the age of <i>Archaeocalamites</i> and the
    few characters with which we are acquainted, it is probable that this
    genus is very closely related to the typical <i>Calamites</i>, and may
    be regarded as a type which is in the direct line of development of
    the more modern Calamite and the living <i>Equisetum</i>. Weiss<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>
    includes <i>Archaeocalamites</i> as one of his subgenera with
    <i>Calamitina</i> and others, and it is quite possible that the genus
    has not more claim to stand alone than other forms at present included
    in the comprehensive genus <i>Calamites</i>.</p>

  <p>The student will find detailed descriptions of this genus in the works
    which have been referred to in the preceding pages.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> genus <i>Sphenophyllum</i> is placed in a special class, as
    representing a type which cannot be legitimately included in any of the
    existing groups of Vascular Cryptogams. Although this Palaeozoic genus
    possesses points of contact with various living plants, it is generally
    admitted by palaeobotanists that it constitutes a somewhat isolated
    type among the Pteridophytes of the Coal-Measures. Our knowledge of the
    anatomy of both vegetative shoots and strobili is now fairly complete,
    and the facts that we possess are in favour of excluding the genus from
    any of the three main divisions of the Pteridophyta.</p>

  <p>In Scheuchzer’s <cite>Herbarium Diluvianum</cite> there is a careful drawing
    of some fragments of slender twigs, from an English locality, bearing
    verticils of cuneiform leaves, which the author compares with the
    common <i>Galium</i><a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>. As regards superficial external resemblance,
    the <i>Galium</i> of our hedgerows agrees very closely with what must
    have been the appearance of fresh green shoots of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>.</p>

  <p>A twig of the same species of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> is figured by
    Schlotheim<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> in the first part of his work on fossil plants;
    he regards it as probably a fragment of some species of Palm.
    Sternberg<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> was the first to institute a generic name for this genus
    of plants, and specimens were described by him in 1825 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>as a species
    of the genus <i>Rotularia</i>. The name <i>Sphenophyllites</i> was
    proposed by Brongniart<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> in 1822 as a substitute for Schlotheim’s
    genus, and in a later work<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> the French author instituted the
    genus <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. Dawson<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> was the first to make any
    reference to the anatomy of this genus; but it is from the examination
    of the much more perfect material from St. Étienne, Autun, and other
    continental localities, the North of England and Pettycur in Scotland,
    by Renault, Williamson, Zeiller and Scott, that our more complete
    knowledge has been acquired.</p>

  <p>The affinity of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> has always been a matter of
    speculation; it has been compared with Dicotyledons, Palms, Conifers
    (<i>Ginkgo</i> and <i>Phyllocladus</i>), and various Pteridophytes,
    such as <i>Ophioglossum</i>, <i>Tmesipteris</i>, <i>Marsilia</i>,
    <i>Salvinia</i>, <i>Equisetum</i> and the Lycopodiaceae<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">DEFINITION.</div>

  <p>We may define the genus <i>Sphenophyllum</i> as follows:—</p>

  <p>Stem comparatively slender (1·5–15 mm.?), articulated, usually somewhat
    tumid at the nodes; the surface of the internodes is marked by more or
    less distinct ribs and grooves which do not alternate at the nodes,
    but follow a straight course from one internode to the next. A single
    branch is occasionally given off from a node. Adventitious roots are
    very rarely seen, their surface does not show the ridges and grooves of
    the foliage-shoots.</p>

  <p>The leaves are borne in verticils at the nodes, those in the same whorl
    being usually of the same size, but in some forms two of the leaves are
    distinctly smaller than the others. Each verticil contains normally
    6, 9, 12, 18 or more leaves, which are separate to the base and not
    fused into a sheath; the number of leaves in a verticil is not always
    a multiple of six. They vary in form from cuneiform with a narrow
    tapered base, and a lamina traversed by several forked veins, to narrow
    uninerved leaves and leaves with a lamina dissected into dichotomously
    branched <span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>linear segments. The leaves of successive whorls are
    superposed.</p>

  <p>The strobili are long and narrow in form, having a length in some
    cases of 12 cm., and a diameter of 12 mm.; they occur as shortly
    stalked lateral branches, or terminate long leaf-bearing shoots. The
    axis of the cone bears whorls of numerous linear lanceolate bracts
    fused basally into a coherent funnel-shaped disc, bearing on its upper
    surface sporangiophores and sporangia.</p>

  <p>The strobili are usually isosporous, but possibly heterosporous in some
    forms.</p>

  <p>The stem is monostelic, with a triarch or hexarch triangular strand
    of centripetally developed primary xylem, consisting of reticulate,
    scalariform and spiral tracheae; the protoxylem elements being
    situated at the blunt corners of the xylem-strand. Foliar bundles are
    given off, either singly or in pairs, from each angle of the central
    primary strand. The secondary xylem consists of radially disposed
    reticulate or scalariform tracheae, developed from a cambium-layer.
    The phloem is made up of thin-walled elements, including sieve-tubes
    and parenchyma. Both xylem and phloem include secondary medullary
    rays of parenchymatous cells. The cortex consists in part of fairly
    thick-walled elements; in older stems the greater part of the cortical
    region is cut off by the development of deep-seated layers of periderm.</p>

  <p>The roots are apparently diarch in structure, with a lacunar and smooth
    cortex.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The branch of <i>Sphenophyllum emarginatum</i> Brongn. given in fig.
    109 shows the characteristic appearance of the genus as represented
    by this well-known species which Brongniart figured in 1822. The
    Indian species shown in fig. 111 illustrates the occurrence of unequal
    leaves in the same whorl, and in fig. 110, <i>B</i>, we have a form of
    verticil in which the leaves are deeply divided into filiform segments.
    A larger-leaved form is represented by <i>S. Thoni</i>, Mahr. (fig.
    110, <i>A</i>), a species occasionally met with in Permian rocks.</p>

  <p>No specimens of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> have so far been found attached
    to a thick stem; they always occur as slender shoots,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span> which sometimes
    reach a considerable length. One of the longest examples known is in
    the collection of the Austrian Geological Survey; the axis is 4 mm. in
    breadth and 85 cm. long, bearing a slender branch 61 cm. in length. The
    manner of occurrence of the specimen as a curved slender stem on the
    surface of the rock suggests a weak plant, which must have depended
    for support on some external aid, either water or another plant. The
    anatomical structure and other features do not favour the suggestion
    of some writers that <i>Sphenophyllum</i> was a water-plant<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>, but
    there would seem to be no serious obstacle in the way of regarding it
    as possibly a slender plant which flung itself on the branches and
    stems of stronger forest trees for support.</p>

  <h3 id="Sphenophyllum_anatomy">A. The anatomy of Sphenophyllum.</h3>

  <p>The following account of the structural features of the stem and root
    is based on the work of Renault<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>, Williamson<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> and Williamson
    and Scott<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>. We may first consider such characters as have been
    recognised in different examples of the genus, and then notice briefly
    the distinguishing peculiarities of two well-marked specific types.</p>

  <h4 id="Sphenophyllum_Stems"><i>a.</i> <i>Stems.</i></h4>

  <p>i. Primary structure.</p>

  <p>In a transverse section of a young <i>Sphenophyllum</i> stem such
    as that diagrammatically sketched in fig. 105, <i>A</i>, we find in
    the centre the xylem portion of a single stele with a characteristic
    triangular form. The primary xylem consists mainly of fairly large
    tracheae with numerous pits on their walls; towards the end of each
    arm the tracheids become scalariform, and at the apex there is a group
    of narrower spiral protoxylem elements. In the British species there
    is a single protoxylem group at the apex of each arm, but Renault has
    described some French stems in which the stele appears to be hexarch,
    having two protoxylem groups at the end of each of the three rays
    of the stele. The primary xylem strand of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> has
    therefore a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>root-like structure, the tracheids having been developed
    centripetally from the three initial protoxylem groups. This type of
    structure is typical of roots, but it also occurs in the stems of some
    recent Vascular Cryptogams.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>As a rule the tissue next the xylem has not been petrified, but in
    exceptionally well-preserved examples it is seen to consist of a band
    of thin-walled elements, of which those in contact with the xylem may
    be spoken of as phloem, and those beyond as the pericycle. Succeeding
    this band of delicate tissue there is a broader band of thicker-walled
    and somewhat elongated elements, constituting the cortex. The specimen
    drawn in fig. 105, <i>A</i>, shows very prominent grooves in the
    cortex opposite the middle of each bay of the primary wood. It is
    these grooves that give to the ordinary casts of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>
    branches the appearance of longitudinal lines traversing each
    internode. In a longitudinal section of a stem, the cortical tissue
    (fig. 104, <i>c</i>) is found to be broader in the nodal regions,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>thus giving rise to the tumid nodes referred to in the diagnosis. The
    increased breadth at the nodes does not mean that the xylem is broader
    in these regions, as it is in Calamite stems. Small strands of vascular
    tissue are given off from the three edges of the triangular stele
    (fig. 105 <i>A</i>) at each node;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span> these branch in passing through the
    cortex on their way to the verticils of leaves. The space <i>b</i> in
    the diagrammatic section of fig. 104 was originally occupied by the
    phloem and inner cortex. In some species of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> the
    apex of each arm of the xylem strand, as seen in transverse section, is
    occupied by a longitudinal canal surrounded by spiral tracheids, as in

  <p>ii. Secondary structure.</p>

  <p>With the exception of very young twigs the petrified
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i> stems usually show a greater or less development
    of secondary wood. In the xylem-strand of fig. 105, <i>B</i>, the broad
    concave bays of the primary wood have been filled in by the development
    of two rows of large secondary tracheids, <i>x</i>, but opposite the
    protoxylem groups, <i>px</i>, there are no signs of cambial activity.
    In the unusually large stem represented by a rough sketch in fig. 105,
    <i>C</i>, the triangular primary xylem lies in the centre of a thick
    mass of secondary vascular tissue. The secondary and primary wood
    together have a diameter of about 5 mm.</p>

  <p>After the bays between each protoxylem corner have been filled in, the
    formation of secondary wood proceeds uniformly along the stem radii,
    but the rows of tracheids and medullary rays which are developed
    opposite the corners of the primary strand, <i>c</i>, differ in certain
    characters from the broader masses of wood opposite the bays. For
    convenience, the secondary wood, <i>c</i>, opposite the protoxylem
    groups has been spoken of as <em>fascicular wood</em>, and the rest,
    <i>d</i>, as <em>interfascicular wood</em>.</p>

  <p>The secondary xylem consists either of tracheae with numerous bordered
    pits on their radial walls (fig. 105, <i>D</i>), or of tracheae
    with broad and bordered scalariform pits (fig. 105, <i>E</i>). The
    suggestion of concentric rings of growth in the wood in fig. 105,
    <i>C</i>, is rather deceptive; there are no well-marked regular rings
    in <i>Sphenophyllum</i> stems, but irregular bands of smaller elements
    occasionally interrupt the uniformity of the secondary xylem. In some
    stems the medullary rays have the form of rows of parenchymatous
    cells, which in tangential longitudinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span> section are found to consist
    frequently of a single row of radially disposed elements; this type of
    medullary rays occurs in the species <i>Sphenophyllum insigne</i>, in
    which the tracheae are scalariform. Three medullary rays, <i>r</i>,
    are seen on the radial face of the scalariform tracheids in fig. 105,
    <i>E</i>, which represents a radial section of this species. In other
    species, <i>e.g.</i> <i>S. plurifoliatum</i>, the medullary rays have
    a peculiar and characteristic structure; in a transverse section of
    the stem they appear as groups of a few parenchymatous cells in the
    spaces between the truncated angles of the large tracheae (fig. 106).
    In longitudinal section these medullary-ray elements resemble thick
    bars stretching radially across the face of the tracheae (fig. 105,
    <i>D</i>, <i>r</i>); the apparent septa or bars are however thin-walled
    cells connecting the different groups of medullary-ray cells, as seen
    in a transverse section. These radial connecting cells are occasionally
    seen as short rays in transverse sections of stems.</p>

  <p>The cambium and phloem elements are occasionally preserved in good
    specimens of older stems; the former consist of tabular flatted
    thin-walled cells, and the latter in some cases include large
    sieve-tubes and narrower parenchymatous elements.</p>

  <p>The sections shown in fig. 107, <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>, illustrate the
    preservation of cambial and phloem tissue. In the transverse section
    of fig. 107, <i>F</i>, the secondary xylem with the medullary rays,
    <i>r</i>, is succeeded by a few tabular cambium cells, and external to
    these there are thin-walled elements of unequal size representing the
    phloem. In fig. 107, <i>E</i>, the scalariform tracheids are succeeded
    by narrow thin-walled cells, and the larger elements with transverse
    and oblique septa are no doubt sieve-tubes.</p>

  <p>In the large stem of fig. 105, <i>C</i>, the xylem is succeeded by
    a band of tissue, a, which is no doubt phloem, and external to this
    there is a considerable development of periderm (<i>b</i>). The
    periderm in <i>Sphenophyllum</i> stems had a deep-seated origin, the
    phellogen or cork-cambium occasionally being formed in the secondary
    phloem-parenchyma, and in other cases in the pericycle, as in the stems
    of some living dicotyledons. Williamson and Scott<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> describe stems
    in which a succession of phellogens <span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>were formed at different levels,
    thus producing a scaly type of bark, such as we find in the Pine or the
    Plane tree.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">SPHENOPHYLLUM PLURIFOLIATUM.</div>

  <p>Before describing the structure of the strobili of
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, we may briefly point out the distinguishing
    features of two specific types of the genus recently described by
    Williamson and Scott. One of these species, <i>S. insigne</i>, was
    originally described by Williamson as an <i>Asterophyllites</i>; the
    numerous narrow linear leaves in each verticil led to the inclusion of
    the specimens in the latter genus. The material on which this species
    is founded is from the volcanic beds of Pettycur, Burntisland, on the
    coast of the Firth of Forth.</p>

  <p>An <em>intercellular space</em> occurs at each angle of the three-rayed
    primary xylem strand, and spiral tracheae are abundant. The tracheae
    of the secondary wood have <em>scalariform markings</em> on the radial
    walls. <em>Regular medullary rays</em> extend through the secondary wood.
    The phloem contains large sieve-tubes.</p>

  <p>This species occurs in the Calciferous sandstone rocks of Burntisland,
    and has lately been recorded from Germany. It characterises a lower
    horizon than <i>S. plurifoliatum</i> (Will. and Scott).</p>

  <p>The specific name <i>plurifoliatum</i> was proposed by Williamson and
    Scott for a type of stem originally described by Williamson<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> as an
    <i>Asterophyllites</i>, from the Coal-Measures of Oldham, Lancashire.
    This form of stem has not so far been connected with any of the older
    species founded on external characters, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>but it evidently bore foliage
    in which the leaves were deeply divided, as in <i>Sphenophyllum
    trichomatosum</i> (fig. 110, <i>B</i>).</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In this species there are <cite>no canals</cite> at the angles of the primary
    xylem, and there are fewer spiral tracheae than in <i>S. insigne</i>.
    The tracheae of the secondary wood have <em>numerous small pits</em>
    on the radial walls, and the medullary rays are chiefly composed of
    parenchymatous cells, which appear in transverse section as <em>groups
    of cells</em> between the truncated angles of the tracheae. The
    characters are fairly well seen in the xylem portion of a stele shown
    in fig. 106. The fascicular wood includes some rows of parenchymatous
    medullary-ray cells in addition to the characteristic groups, as seen
    in the figure. A slightly oblique transverse section of a stem is often
    convenient in the interpretation of histological features; one of the
    sections of <i>S. plurifoliatum</i> in the Williamson collection (no.
    893), which has been cut somewhat obliquely, shows very clearly the
    differences in pitting exhibited by the different xylem elements.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span></p>

  <h4 id="Sphenophyllum_Roots"><i>b. Roots.</i></h4>

  <p>Our knowledge of the anatomy of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> roots is very
    limited. Renault has described a somewhat imperfect example of a
    silicified root from St. Étienne and Autun. The drawing in fig.
    107, <i>B</i>, which is copied from one of Renault’s figures, shows
    a cylindrical mass of xylem with a small band of narrower elements
    occupying the centre, and surrounded by rows of larger secondary
    tracheae. The central bipolar band is described as the diarch primary
    xylem, around which the secondary pitted elements have been developed.</p>

  <p>It is probable that the specimen described by Renault is a root of
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, but my impression gained from an examination of
    the section was that the diarch primary strand is not quite so clear as
    in the published figures. Until we possess better material we cannot
    attempt any very satisfactory description of the anatomical features of
    the roots of this genus.</p>

  <p>A section of a <i>Sphenophyllum</i> stem has been figured by
    Felix<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>, in which a lateral member is being given off; this may
    possibly represent the origin of an adventitious root, but the
    preservation is not sufficiently distinct to render this certain.</p>

  <h4 id="Sphenophyllum_Leaves"><i>c. Leaves.</i></h4>

  <p>Renault<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> has described some silicified leaves of
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i> from Autun in which the laminae consist of
    thin-walled loose parenchyma, traversed by small groups of tracheids
    constituting the simple or forked veins. The epidermis is made up of
    a single layer of cells, with here and there indistinct indications
    of stomata. A more perfect stoma has, however, been described by
    Solms-Laubach from the epidermis of a bract in a strobilus (fig. 107,
    <i>A</i>).</p>

  <h4 id="Sphenophyllum_Cones"><i>d. Cones.</i></h4>

  <p>The history of the recognition of the cones of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>
    has already been briefly alluded to in chapter V., p. 100. The main
    points in the structure of the cones of this genus were known for
    several years, before the fact was established that they belonged
    to <i>Sphenophyllum</i> stems. In 1871 Williamson<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> published an
    account of an imperfect fossil strobilus from the Lower Coal-Measures
    of Oldham, Lancashire, under the name of <i>Volkmannia Dawsoni</i>.
    The generic term <i>Volkmannia</i> has been used by different
    writers for cones varying considerably in structural features; in
    the case of Williamson’s fossil, Weiss<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> substituted the name
    <i>Bowmanites</i>, a genus instituted by Binney<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> for a strobilus
    apparently of the same type as <i>Volkmannia Dawsoni</i>. In 1891
    Williamson<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> described some additional specimens of <i>Bowmanites
    Dawsoni</i>, and, as in his earlier paper, he compared the strobilus
    with <i>Asterophyllites</i> and <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, but it was still
    a matter of speculation as to what was the form of the vegetative
    branches. Soon after the more complete account of the English cones
    was published, Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> recognised a close agreement between some
    French and Belgian specimens of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> strobili and the
    strobilus described by Williamson. A closer comparison thoroughly
    established the connection between <i>Bowmanites Dawsoni</i> and
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i>; and there is little doubt that this strobilus
    belongs to the stem known as <i>Sphenophyllum cuneifolium</i>
    (Sternb.)—a well-known species of the genus.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">STROBILUS.</div>

  <p>The most important morphological features of the strobilus of
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i> may best be illustrated by a detailed account of
    one specific type, and by a brief reference to other forms which are
    characterised by certain differences in the number and attachment of
    the sporangia. When we know that a given strobilus must have grown on
    a <i>Sphenophyllum</i> stem, the obvious name to assign to it would
    seem to be that of the plant which bore it; but there are advantages
    in making use of special generic terms for detached cones, which
    cannot be referred with certainty to a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>particular species of stem.
    The genus <i>Calamostachys</i> affords an example of a name which
    is intended to denote that a cone so called belongs to a Calamarian
    plant; similarly such a name as <i>Sphenophyllostachys</i> may be used
    for Sphenophylloid cones which cannot be connected with certainty to
    particular species of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. It has been suggested that
    the genus <i>Bowmanites</i>, first used for a cone which was afterwards
    recognised as belonging to a <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, should be employed
    instead of the sesquipedalian term <i>Sphenophyllostachys</i>. The
    latter is used here as being in accordance with a generally accepted
    and convenient system of nomenclature, and as a name which at once
    denotes the fact that the fossil is not only a cone but that it belongs
    to a <i>Sphenophyllum</i>.</p>

      <i>Sphenophyllum</i> strobilus.<br />
      The upper figure represents a portion of a whorl of bracts. (The smaller figure, after Zeiller.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The cone consists of a central axis bearing a number of verticils
    of bracts coherent in their lower portions in the form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span> of a widely
    open funnel-shaped disc, which splits up peripherally into 14–20
    linear-lanceolate segments. The free segments of each verticil have
    an obliquely ascending or almost vertical position, and extend
    upwards for a distance of about six internodes. The smaller drawing
    in fig. 108 shows the appearance in side view of the narrow bracts of
    a single whorl. A transverse section of a strobilus would include,
    therefore, sections of several concentric series of ascending bracts.
    The verticils of <i>Sphenophyllostachys Dawsoni</i> are probably
    superposed, but this point has not been definitely settled. From
    the upper surface of the coherent basal portion of each verticil,
    there are given off twice as many sporangiophores as there are free
    segments, and these are attached close to the line of junction of the
    axis of the cone and the funnel-shaped disc. Each sporangiophore has
    the form of a slender stalk which bends inwards at its distal end
    and bears a single sporangium (<i>cf.</i> fig. 107, <i>D</i>). The
    sporangiophores given off from the same verticil of bracts vary in
    length. All the sporangiophores are attached to the coherent bracts
    at the same distance from the axis of the cone; but as the sporangia
    between each verticil of bracts are arranged in two or three concentric
    series, it follows that the length of the sporangiophores varies
    considerably. The diagrammatic longitudinal section of a strobilus in
    fig. 108 shows three concentric series of sporangia between successive
    bract-verticils. A similar diagram was published by Williamson in
    1892<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>, and afterwards copied by Potonié<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>, but in Williamson’s
    restoration the sporangiophores of the three series of sporangia are
    erroneously represented as arising from different points on the surface
    of the bracts. There is little doubt, as regards the strobilus of <i>S.
    cuneifolium</i>, that the sporangiophores were given off in a single
    series close to the axils of the bracts, as is partially shown in fig. 108.</p>

  <p>The central part of the axis of the cone is occupied by a single
    triangular stele like that of the stem, except that each ray of the
    xylem strand has a comparatively broad blunt termination, and is
    not tapered to a narrow arm as in fig. 105, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span><i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.
    The wood consists of pitted tracheae, with two groups of protoxylem
    elements at each of the truncated angles of the solid strand of xylem.
    From the angles of the stele branches of vascular tissue pass out
    through the cortex to supply the sterile and fertile segments of each
    verticil. One of the transverse sections of the <i>Sphenophyllum</i>
    cone in the British Museum Collection (no. 1898 <i>E</i>) affords a
    good example of the misleading appearance occasionally presented by an
    intruded ‘rootlet’ of <i>Stigmaria</i>; the vascular tissue of the cone
    has disappeared, and a Stigmarian appendage with its vascular bundle
    occupies the position of the stelar tissues.</p>

  <p>The bracts consist of parenchymatous tissue limited externally by an
    epidermis containing stomata. A single stoma with subsidiary cells is
    represented in fig. 107, <i>A</i>. The sporangiophores are composed
    internally of thin-walled cells with stronger cells towards the
    surface. The longer sporangiophores in a series may be more or less
    coherent for part of their length to the upper surface of the verticil
    of bracts. In fig. 108 the slender sporangiophores do not appear to
    come off always from the same portion of the bracts, but this is due to
    some of them lying on the surface of the latter during part of their
    course to support the external circle of sporangia. The hook-like
    distal end of a sporangiophore, towards the point of attachment of
    the sporangium, is characterised by the larger size and greater
    prominence of the surface cells; these larger cells, which pass over
    the upper surface of a sporangium base, probably constitute a kind
    of <em>annulus</em> which determines the dehiscence of the sporangial
    wall<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>.</p>

  <p>Fig. 107, <i>G</i>, represents a sporangiophore and its sporangium cut
    through transversely just below the point of attachment of the latter
    to the end of the hook-like termination of the former. The spores are
    characterised by an irregularly reticulate thickening of the outer coat
    or exospore, as seen in the figure.</p>

  <p>One of the chief points of interest suggested by a <i>Sphenophyllum</i>
    cone is the exact morphological nature of the sporangiophores. Are
    they branches borne in the axils of bracts, or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>may we regard each
    sporangiophore as a modified leaf, which has become coherent with
    the whorls of sterile leaves? Or is a sporangiophore merely a stalk
    of a sporangium; or a ventral lobe of a leaf, of which the sterile
    bracts represent the dorsal lobes? Although it is impossible without
    the evidence of development to decide with certainty between these
    alternatives, it would seem most probable that a sporangiophore may
    be looked upon as a ventral lobe of a leaf, the sterile lobes forming
    the bracts or members of the sterile whorls of the cone. This question
    is discussed by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> and Williamson and Scott<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>, also more
    recently by Scott<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> in his memoir on <i>Cheirostrobus</i>.</p>

  <h5 id="S_Romeri"><i>Sphenophyllostachys Römeri</i> (Solms-Laubach)<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>. Fig. 107,
    <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>.</h5>

  <p>In another type of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> strobilus, recently described
    by Solms-Laubach, the incurved end of each sporangiophore bore two
    sporangia. In most respects this species, which has not been found in
    connection with a vegetative shoot, agrees with <i>Sphenophyllostachys
    Dawsoni</i>.</p>

  <p>In fig. 107, <i>C</i>, which is copied from one of Solms-Laubach’s
    drawings<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>, we have an oblique transverse section of part of a
    strobilus, including portions of two series of sporangia borne on one
    verticil of bracts, and at the right-hand edge the section has passed
    through the sporangia belonging to another whorl of bracts. There were
    probably three concentric series of sporangia attached to each verticil
    of bracts, as in the case of fig. 108. The unshaded area, <i>b</i>
    (fig. 107, <i>C</i>), represents the bracts of two successive sterile
    whorls in transverse section. The shaded areas are the sporangia, with
    their sporangiophores, <i>s</i>. The relative position of the sporangia
    and sporangiophores suggests that each pedicel bore two sporangia
    at its tip, instead of one, as in the strobilus of <i>Sphenophyllum
    cuneifolium</i> (Sternb.).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span></p>

  <p>A further variation in the structure of the strobili is illustrated
    by some specimens of <i>S. trichomatosum</i> Stur, described by
    Kidston<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>, from the Coal-Measures of Barnsley. Each whorl of bracts
    bears a single series of oval sporangia which appear to be sessile
    on the basal portion of the whorl. It is possible that delicate
    sporangiophores may have been present, but in the imperfect examples in
    Kidston’s collection<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> the sporangia present the appearance of being
    seated directly on the surface of the bracts. As the specimens do not
    show any internal structure, it would be unwise to lay too much stress
    on the apparent absence of the characteristic sporangiophores. In any
    case, Kidston’s cones afford an illustration of the occurrence of a
    single series of sporangia in each whorl, instead of the pluriseriate
    manner of occurrence in some other species.</p>

  <p>The statement is occasionally met with that some <i>Sphenophyllum</i>
    cones possessed two kinds of spores, but we are still in want of
    satisfactory evidence that this was really the case. Renault has
    described an imperfect specimen, which he considers points to the
    heterosporous nature of a <i>Sphenophyllum</i> cone, but Zeiller and
    Williamson and Scott have expressed doubts as to the correctness of
    Renault’s conclusions. While admitting the possibility of undoubted
    heterosporous strobili being discovered, we are not in a position to
    refer to <i>Sphenophyllum</i> as having borne strobili containing two
    kinds of spores<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>.</p>

  <p>This species of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> bears verticils of six or eight
    wedge-shaped leaves varying in breadth and in the extent of dissection
    of the laminae; they are truncated distally, and terminate in a margin
    characterised by blunt or obtusely-rounded teeth, each of which
    receives a single vein. The larger leaves are usually more or less
    deeply divided by a median slit. The narrow base of each leaf receives
    a single vein which branches repeatedly in a dichotomous manner in
    the substance <span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>of the lamina. Several drawings have been given by
    Sterzel<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> in a memoir on Permian plants, showing the variation in
    leaf-form in <i>Sphenophyllum emarginatum</i>, but as Kidston<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> and
    Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> have pointed out Sterzel’s specimens probably belong to
    <i>S. cuneifolium</i> (Sternb.).</p>

  <p>Branches are given off singly from the nodes, and the cones are
    borne at the tips of branches or branchlets. The cone of <i>S.
    emarginatum</i> agrees very closely with that of <i>S. cuneifolium</i>,
    and is of the same type as that shown in fig. 108. The small branch of
    <i>S. emarginatum</i> represented in fig. 109 does not show clearly the
    detailed characters of the species, as the leaf-margins are not well
    preserved.</p>

  <p>In one of the largest specimens of this species which I have seen, in
    the Leipzig Museum, the main stem has internodes of about 3·9 cm. in
    length, from which a lateral branch with much shorter internodes is
    given off from a node.</p>

  <p>It is important to notice the close resemblance, as pointed out
    by Zeiller, between some of the narrower-leaved forms of <i>S.
    emarginatum</i> and <i>S. cuneifolium</i> (Sternb.)<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>; but in the
    latter species the margins of the leaves have sharp, and not blunt teeth.</p>

  <p>The cone described and figured by Weiss<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> as <i>Bowmanites
    germanicus</i>, since investigated by Solms-Laubach<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>, must be
    referred to this species. Geinitz<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> figured a cone in 1855 as that
    of <i>S. emarginatum</i>, but his determination of the species is a
    little doubtful. Good figures of the true cone of <i>S. emarginatum</i>
    have been given by Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> in his <cite>Flore de Valenciennes</cite>,
    as well as in his important memoir on the fructification of
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i>.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">LEAVES.</div>

  <div class="center" id="S_trichomatosum">2. <i>Sphenophyllum trichomatosum</i> Stur. Fig. 110, <i>B</i>.</div>

  <p>The finely-divided leaves of the single whorl shown in fig. 110,
    <i>B</i> (from the Middle Coal-Measures of Barnsley, Yorkshire),
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>afford an example of a form of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> which is
    represented by such species as <i>S. tenerrimum</i> Ett.<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>, <i>S.
    trichomatosum</i> Stur<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>, and <i>S. myriophyllum</i><a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> Crép.
    Probably the specimen should be referred to <i>S. trichomatosum</i>,
    but it is almost impossible to speak with certainty as to the specific
    value of an isolated leaf-whorl of this form. It has long been known
    that the leaves of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> may vary considerably, as
    regards the size of the segments, on the same plant; and the occurrence
    of such finely-divided leaves has lent support to an opinion which
    was formerly held by some writers, that <i>Asterophyllites</i> and
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i> could not be regarded as well-defined separate
    genera. This heterophylly of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> has thus been
    responsible for certain mistaken opinions both as to the relation of
    the genus to <i>Calamocladus</i><a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> (<i>Asterophyllites</i>), and as
    regards the view that the finely-divided laminae belonged to submerged
    leaf-whorls, while the broader segments were those of floating or
    subaerial whorls.</p>

  <p>There is a very close resemblance between some of the deeply-cut
    and linear segments of a <i>Sphenophyllum</i> and the leaves of
    <i>Calamocladus</i>, but in the former genus the linear segments
    are found to be connected basally into a narrow common sheath. The
    assertion<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> that the deeply-cut leaves occur on the lower portions
    of stems is not supported by the facts. Kidston<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> has pointed
    out that the cones are often borne on branches with such leaves,
    and the same author refers to a figure by Germar, in which entire
    and much-divided leaves occur mixed together in the same individual
    specimen. M. Zeiller recently pointed out to me a similar irregular
    association of broader and narrower leaf-segments on the same
    shoots in some large specimens in the École des Mines, Paris. Cones
    of <i>Sphenophyllum tenerrimum</i> have been figured by Stur<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a>
    and others; they are characterised by their small size and by the
    dissection of the slender free portions of the narrow bracts<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>.</p>

  <p>The leaf-forms illustrated by figs. 109 and 110 are some of the more

  <p>The species shown in fig. 111 has been usually described as a
    separate genus <i>Trizygia</i>, a name instituted by Royle in 1834
    for some Indian fossils from the Lower Gondwana rocks of India<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>.
    Zeiller<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> has lately pointed out the advisability of including this
    Asiatic type in the genus <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. The slender stem bears
    verticils of cuneate leaves in three pairs at each node, the anterior
    pair being smaller than the two lateral pairs. The characteristic
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i> venation is clearly seen in the enlarged leaf,
    fig. 111, <i>B</i>.</p>

  <p>The inequality of the members of a single whorl, which characterises
    this Indian plant, is sometimes met with in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>European species.
    A specimen of <i>Sphenophyllum oblongifolium</i>, which Prof.
    Zeiller showed me in illustration of this point, was practically
    indistinguishable from <i>Trizygia</i><a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>.</p>

  <p>In some of the earlier descriptions of the Indian species the generic
    name <i>Sphenophyllum</i><a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> was used by McClelland and others, but
    the supposed difference in the leaf-whorls was made the ground of
    reverting to the distinct generic term <i>Trizygia</i>. Now that a
    similar type of leaf-whorl is known to occur in <i>Sphenophyllum</i>,
    it is better to adopt that genus rather than to allow the question of
    locality to unduly influence the choice of a separate generic name for
    an Indian plant.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">GEOLOGICAL RANGE.</div>

  <h4 id="Sphenophyllum_Affinities">C. Affinities, range and habit of Sphenophyllum.</h4>

  <p>It has been pointed out in the description of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>,
    that the most widely separated families of recent plants have
    been selected by different authors as the nearest living allies
    of this Palaeozoic genus. It is now generally admitted that
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i> is a generic type apart; it cannot be classed
    in any family or sub-class of recent or fossil plants, without
    considerably extending or modifying the recognised characteristics of
    existing divisions of the plant-kingdom. The anatomical characters of
    the <i>Sphenophyllum</i> stem are such as one finds in some recent
    genera of the Lycopodineae, especially <i>Psilotum</i>. If the stele of
    <i>Psilotum</i> were composed internally of a solid strand of xylem, we
    should have a close correspondence between the centripetally-developed
    wood of this genus and that of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. Similar
    comparisons might be drawn with other existing genera, but the more
    detailed consideration of the affinities of the Palaeozoic plant will
    be more easily dealt with after other members of the Pteridophytes
    have been described. The recent discovery of an entirely new type of
    Carboniferous strobilus in rocks of Calciferous sandstone age on the
    shores of the Firth of Forth has thrown new light on the position of
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. <i>Cheirostrobus Pettycurensis</i>, the new
    cone which Scott has described in an able memoir, affords <span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>certain
    points of contact with <i>Sphenophyllum</i> on the one hand and with
    <i>Calamites</i> on the other. This important question will be dealt
    with after we have given an account of <i>Cheirostrobus</i><a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>.
    To put the matter shortly, <i>Sphenophyllum</i> agrees with some
    Lycopodinous plants in its anatomical features; with the Equisetales it
    is connected by the verticillate disposition of the leaves, and some of
    the forms of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> strobili present features which also
    point to Equisetinous affinities.</p>

  <p>In his Presidential address to the Botanical Section at the
    British Association Meeting of 1896 Scott<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> thus refers to the
    Sphenophyllums:—“We may hazard the guess that this interesting group
    may have been derived from some unknown form lying at the root of
    both Calamites and Lycopods. The existence of the Sphenophyllae
    certainly suggests the probability of a common origin for these two
    series.” The result of the subsequent investigation of the new cone
    <i>Cheirostrobus</i> amply justifies this opinion as to the position of
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i>.</p>

  <p>It is probable that <i>Sphenophyllum</i> lived during the Devonian
    period, but the unsatisfactory specimens on which Dawson has founded
    a species of this age, <i>S. antiquum</i><a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a>, can hardly be said
    to afford positive evidence of the Pre-Carboniferous existence of
    the genus. From the Culm rocks and other strata older than the
    Coal-Measures, we have such species as <i>S. insigne</i> (Will.),
    <i>Sphenophyllostachys Römeri</i> (Solms-Laubach), and <i>Sphenophyllum
    tenerrimum</i>, Ett.<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> while <i>S. emarginatum</i>[5], Brongn.
    occurs in the Upper Coal-Measures and in the Transition rocks. <i>S.
    cuneifolium</i><a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> (Sternb.) has been recorded from the Transition,
    Middle and Lower Coal-Measures. <i>Sphenophyllum oblongifolium</i>,
    Germ.<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>, is recorded from Lower Permian rocks, as is also <i>S.
    Thoni</i><a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>, Mahr.</p>

  <p>The comparison which has naturally been drawn between
    <i>Sphenophyllum</i> with its slender stems bearing occasionally
    dimorphic leaves, and water-plants is not, I believe, supported
    by the facts of anatomy or external characters. The entire and
    finely-dissected leaves do not exhibit that regularity of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>relative
    disposition which is characteristic of aquatic plants; the two
    forms of leaves may occur indiscriminately on the same branch.
    The well-developed and thick xylem is not in accordance with the
    anatomical features usually associated with water-plants. It is true
    that in some living dicotyledons of the family Leguminosae, which
    inhabit swampy places, the secondary xylem is represented by a thick
    mass of unlignified and thin-walled parenchyma, as in the genus
    <i>Aeschynomene</i><a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>, from which the material of ‘pith’-helmets
    is obtained; but the wood of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> was obviously
    thick-walled and thoroughly lignified.</p>

  <p>It is not improbable that the long and slender stems of this plant may
    have grown like small lianas in the Coal-Measure forests, supporting
    themselves to a large extent on the stouter branches of Calamites and
    other trees. The anatomical structure of a <i>Sphenophyllum</i> stem
    would seem to be in accord with the requirements of a climbing plant.
    It has been shewn<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> that in recent climbing plants the tracheae and
    sieve-tubes are characterised by their large diameter, a fact which
    may be correlated with the small diameter of climbing stems and the
    need for rapid transport of food material. In <i>Sphenophyllum</i> the
    tracheae of the xylem have a wide bore, and in <i>S. insigne</i> the
    phloem contains unusually wide sieve-tubes. The central position of
    the stele is another feature which is not inconsistent with a climbing
    habit. Schwendener and others<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> have demonstrated that in climbing
    organs, as in underground stems and roots, there is a tendency towards
    a centripetal concentration of mechanical or strengthening tissue. The
    axial xylem strand of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> would afford an efficient
    resistance to the tension or pulling force which climbing stems
    encounter.</p>
