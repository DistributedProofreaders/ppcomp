  <p class="drop-cap mt5">THE growing interest in the origin, migrations and life of the races of
    American Antiquity has led me to believe that the subjects considered
    in these pages would meet with the favorable attention of the public
    and of the specialist in this field. With such a conviction I present
    this volume, realizing the difficulties which attend any efforts to
    elucidate such dark problems. Yet I cannot conceal my satisfaction
    that the age of North American Antiquity is not all darkness, but on
    the contrary is rapidly growing radiant with light, while a host of
    patient searchers for its truths roll up the obscuring curtain. The
    recent discoveries by Geo. Smith, Cesnola, and Schliemann naturally
    cause us to turn with national pride to the rich antiquarian fields
    in our own land. Very satisfactory results have been obtained within
    a few years in the exploration of Mound-works and the Cliff-dwellings
    of the West. A just view of the civilization of the builders of these
    remains, however, requires that it be considered in connection with the
    traditional history and civilization of the ancient races of Mexico and
    Central America, so marked was the influence of the ancient peoples of
    this continent upon each other.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span></p>

  <p>Regarding this to be important, I have endeavored to present a
    comprehensive view of the civilization of the Mound-builders,
    Cliff-dwellers, and Pueblos, and to bring to the attention of the
    reader the traditional history and architectural remains of the Mayas
    of Yucatan and the Nahuas of Mexico. Only the probable origin and
    the most remote period of the growth of these latter peoples could
    receive attention within the limits prescribed for this work, since it
    is my design that this volume shall serve as a manual of information
    relating to the earliest period of North-American Antiquity, and as
    an introduction to Ancient American History. My material relating to
    the Mound-builders has been drawn almost entirely from the Smithsonian
    Reports, the Proceedings of scientific societies, and private memoirs.
    Still it is but justice to one honored co-laborer in the same field,
    Col. J. W. Foster, to say that his excellent work, <cite>The Pre-Historic
    Races of the U. S.</cite>, has been of great service in our investigation
    of this subject. Although his sources of information have been, with
    few exceptions, before me, my appreciation of his work is attested
    by my constant reference to it. Nevertheless, the wonderful advances
    which have been made in Mound-exploration since the issue of the
    <cite>Pre-Historic Races</cite>, called for a fresh treatment of the subject.</p>

  <p>On the Mayas and Nahuas the following manuscript works in the
    possession of the Congressional Library at Washington were consulted,

  <p>These, together with the large number of printed books relating to
    America in the Congressional Library added to works in my possession,
    afforded an ample field for research.</p>

  <p>I must express my appreciation of the courteous attentions of the
    accomplished Librarian of Congress, the Hon. A. R. Spofford, who
    together with his assistants did everything possible to facilitate
    my investigations. To the uniform and friendly interest which Mr.
    Spofford has manifested in my work, its successful completion is
    largely due. The substantial assistance which I received from the
    lamented Professor Joseph Henry—the record of whose kindly offices
    to his fellowmen can never be written—was invaluable to me. Besides
    placing the latest material at my disposal, he generously furnished
    most of the engravings in this work relating to the Mound-builders.
    Dr. Charles Rau, also of the <cite>Smithsonian Institution</cite>, has
    placed me under obligations for valued services. To Professor F. V.
    Hayden and to the painstaking offices of Mr. James Stevenson of the
    <cite>U. S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories</cite>, I
    am indebted for the engravings as well as the sources of information
    relating to the Cliff-dwellers. The Hon. J. R. Bartlett, of Providence,
    R. I., with equal generosity has conferred like favors. Prof. F. W.
    Putnam, of the Peabody Museum of American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span> Archæology and Ethnology
    at Cambridge, Mass., and his courteous assistants, Mr. Carr and Miss
    Smith, have provided me with valuable engravings and reports. Robert
    Clarke, Esq., and Mr. E. Gest, of Cincinnati, have also sent me
    engravings, and the former in particular has conferred frequent favors.
    Professor Ph. Valentini, of Albion, N. Y., with rare liberality,
    contributed interesting material relating to the Nahua Calendar. To Mr.
    Stephen Salisbury, Jr., of Worcester, Mass., Dr. R. J. Farquharson,
    of the Davenport Academy of Sciences, Rev. S. D. Peet, editor of the
    <cite>American Antiquarian</cite>, Cleveland, O., and to A. J. Conant, Esq.,
    of St. Louis, Mo., I am indebted for the interest they have manifested,
    and for the material which they have brought to my attention.</p>

  <p>Señor Orozco y Berra, of the City of Mexico, the distinguished author
    of the <cite>Geografía de las lenguas Mexicanas</cite>, has from time to time
    freely made important suggestions concerning some of the problems under
    consideration. To my friend the Rev. John W. Butler, of the City of
    Mexico, whose intelligent efforts in my behalf have been unremitting,
    I have special reason to be thankful. To all these generous friends I
    must be permitted here to express my deep sense of gratitude for their
    favors.</p>

  <p>However, this pleasant task would be but half performed were I to omit
    the recognition of the unselfish friendship of the justly eminent
    author of the <cite>Native Races of the Pacific States</cite>. Mr. Hubert
    Howe Bancroft, whose rare erudition and breadth of thought are only
    surpassed by his magnanimity of nature and manliness of spirit, with
    a liberality which has scarce a parallel in authorship, sent me
    the majority of the engravings illustrative of the Maya and Nahua
    architecture and sculpture, used in the fourth volume of the <cite>Native
    Races</cite>. To this I may add the no less valuable encouragement which
    he so heartily gave during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span> the progress of my work. Although some
    of my investigations were prosecuted before the publication of the
    <cite>Native Races</cite>, and though all of Mr. Bancroft’s sources relating
    to subjects which have received our mutual attention were before me and
    underwent a critical examination at my hands, it is but fair to state
    that the assistance which I derived from the <cite>Native Races</cite> has
    been of incalculable service in the preparation of this volume. If in
    any place I have omitted to render full credit to Mr. Bancroft, and to
    that imperishable monument of learning and industry, his great work,
    the omission has been due to inadvertence rather than intention. My
    obligations to Mr. Bancroft can never be discharged, nor can the kind
    attentions of Mr. Henry L. Oak, of the Bancroft Library, San Francisco,
    be forgotten.</p>

  <p>Still my examination of the sources has not always led me to the same
    conclusions as were reached by the author of the <cite>Native Races</cite>.
    This may be owing to our different standpoints of observation, or
    possibly to an inappreciable bias in my own mind. It is, however, but
    justice to myself to say that this work has been prosecuted to its
    completion with the spirit of inquiry rather than of advocacy, and is
    the embodiment of an honest search for the truth.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">ON that eventful morning nearly four centuries ago, when the spell
    of uncertainty and mystery which enshrouded the Atlantic was broken,
    and the darkness of the deep vanished with the darkness of the night,
    the illustrious admiral discovered a world populated with beings
    like himself. They were male and female, with all the physical
    characteristics common to the rest of mankind, and differed from the
    Spaniards only in that their skin was of a copper hue, and their cheek
    bones more prominent. They were tattooed and wore their straight black
    hair, cut short above the ears, with a few unshorn locks falling upon
    their shoulders.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> These naked uncivilized men and women were the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>same in their physical type with those discovered subsequently on
    the islands and the main land by the Cabots, Vespucius, Verrezano,
    and Cartier. To rehearse their descriptions of the natives whom they
    first met would be but to repeat the experience and observations of
    Columbus. Nearly five centuries earlier the Norse adventurer Thorwald
    Ericson (1002 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) encountered natives on the New England
    coast, corresponding in appearance, habits, and condition to those who
    occupied the country when colonized by the first settlers. To these
    natives they gave the name of <em>Skrellings</em>, from <em>skraekja</em>,
    a name which they had previously applied to the Eskimo, meaning <em>to
    cry out</em>.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Thorfin Karlsefne, who also reached the New England
    coast four years later than Thorwald, describes the natives as
    sallow-colored and ill-looking, having ugly heads of hair, large eyes
    and broad cheeks. They came in canoes to his ships for the purposes
    of trade, and though peaceable at first, soon exhibited hostility and
    treachery.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is probable that these Skrellings were North American
    Indians, who had interbred with the Atlantic Coast Eskimo. How long
    the red man’s occupation of the country antedated its discovery by
    the Scandinavians is uncertain. His traditions are worthless on that
    subject. His chronology of moons and cycles is an incoherent and
    contradictory jumble. Nor does he know any more certainly from whence
    he came. It would seem that his race came by installments, if it came
    at all, and that he was just as far advanced in the arts of hunting
    and war and domestic life on the day in which he first possessed
    himself of the soil, as on that in which he was driven from it by the
    European. Only under the fostering care of the white man has he shown
    any improvement, and that has been of such an uncertain character as to
    amount to proof of his incapacity for self-civilization. The Indian,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>measured by his low condition in the scale of progress from the
    extremest barbarism towards semi-civilization, belongs to what is known
    as the flint age (old-stone or Palæolithic) in Europe, in which the
    rudest flint implements seem to have been the chief auxiliaries which
    he possessed with which to supplement and assist his hands in securing
    a livelihood or to protect his person and family from ferocious beasts.
    Perhaps we may more properly place him in a position midway between the
    flint and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> the stone ages (new-stone or Neolithic), for he no doubt
    was possessed of polished stone implements of a limited number and
    variety. Whether made by his own hands or by those of his predecessors
    is uncertain.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In thus assigning the Indian his place in the scale
    by which man’s state of barbarism or degree of civilization has been
    measured by scholars in Europe, we do not pretend to claim for him the
    antiquity of the man of the flint age in any other part of the globe.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>Dr. Abbott, of New Jersey, in an extended treatment of the <cite>Stone
    Age</cite> in his own State, has shown many evidences of the protracted
    occupancy of the Atlantic States by a people whose weapons resemble
    those of ancient man in Europe. Col. Charles Whittlesey has called
    attention to the discovery of Indian remains in the “Shelter Cave,”
    near Elyria, Ohio, and also in a cave near Louisville, Kentucky, where
    the conditions seemed to point to an interment as long ago as two
    thousand years, but the evidences both as to the remains having been
    those of the red man and the period of burial are too uncertain to be
    of any service in the construction of a theory.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <p>The eras or ages which have been observed to mark the different stages
    of the development of pre-historic man in Europe (in the manufacture
    of implements and the construction of places of abode), are apparently
    reversed in America.</p>

  <p>The Neolithic and Bronze ages preceded the Palæolithic at least in
    the Mississippi Basin—not that the last inhabitants deteriorated and
    lost the higher arts which are well known to have been cultivated upon
    the same soil occupied by them, but that they were preceded by a race
    possessed of no inferior civilization, who were not their ancestors,
    but a distinct people with a capacity for progress, for the exercise of
    government, for the erection of magnificent architectural monuments,
    and possessed of a respectable knowledge of geometrical principles.
    The remains of this mysterious people known as the mound-builders
    are spread over thousands of square miles of the United States, and
    it is a question whether the antiquarian is more surprised at the
    greatness of their number than in many instances at the immensity
    of their proportions. The entire valley region of the Missouri,
    Mississippi and Ohio rivers with that of their affluents was occupied
    by this remarkable people—presenting us with a parallel to the ancient
    civilization which flourished in the earliest times on the watercourses
    of the old world. The geographical distribution of these mounds may be
    described in general terms with a view to the territory occupied by
    them in the United States, as central, western, and southern.</p>

  <p>The publication of the valuable works of Squier and Davis, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>of Dr.
    Lapham and those of Mr. Squier alone, in which the remains of these
    regions are described, was like a revelation which brought to light
    the wonders of an entombed civilization.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In treating of the mounds
    geographically, we find no evidences of this people having reached
    the Atlantic seaboard, unless we except the great shell-heaps found
    in various localities on the coast, and of which we will speak
    further on. It is true that in South Carolina a few vestiges of their
    residence are found on the Wateree River near Camden, and in the
    mountainous regions of North Carolina,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> where they wrought mica mines
    for the mineral which they prized as precious, and which so often
    accompanies the remains of their dead. No <em>authentic</em> remains of
    the Mound-Builders are found in the New England States, nor even in
    the State of New York. In the former, we have an isolated mound in
    the valley of the Kennebec in Maine, and dim outlines of enclosures
    near Sanborn and Concord in New Hampshire, but there is no certainty
    of their being the work of this people.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In the latter, it was at
    first supposed that the remains found in the western portion of the
    State were uniform in their plan of construction with the works of
    the Ohio valley; but Mr. Squier pronounces them to be purely the
    work of Red Indians. This conclusion should not be viewed as final,
    even though Cusick’s vague statement (in <cite>Schoolcraft</cite>, vol. v)
    that the Iroquois “were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>compelled to build fortifications in order
    to save themselves from the devouring monsters” lends it an air
    of plausibility. Either people may have been their builders. Col.
    Whittlesey would assign these fort-like structures, differing from
    the more southern enclosures in that they were surrounded by trenches
    on their outside, while the latter uniformly have the trench on the
    inside of the enclosure, to a people anterior to the Red Indian and
    perhaps contemporaneous with the Mound-builders, but distinct from
    either.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> A quite reasonable view is that of Dr. Foster, that they
    are the <em>frontier</em> works of the Mound-builders, adapted to the
    purposes of defence against the sudden irruptions of hostile tribes.
    He remarks, “If our country were to become a desolation, the future
    antiquary would find the sea-coast studded with fortifications of a
    complex form, and as he penetrated to the interior they would disappear
    altogether.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It is probable that these defences belong to the last
    period of the Mound-builders’ residence on the lakes, and were erected
    when the more warlike peoples of the North who drove them from their
    cities first made their appearance. Passing along the boundary of the
    Mound-builders’ territory towards the west, we find the great lakes in
    all cases to have served as its limit on the north. Mr. Henry Gillman
    has described in several publications<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> his exploration of mounds in
    Michigan and the lakes. One of the richest mounds in relics and human
    remains is known as “the Great Mound of the River Rouge,” situated on
    the stream from which it takes its name, near the Detroit River and
    about four and a half miles from the centre of the city of Detroit.
    The mound now measures twenty feet in height, and must originally have
    measured 300 feet in length by 200 in width, though the removal of
    large quantities of sand from it has greatly reduced its proportions
    and destroyed many valuable relics. Many other <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>mounds surrounding it
    have also been removed. The most remarkable result of the exploration
    was the discovery of tibiæ flattened to an extreme degree, such as
    is peculiar to platycnemic man. A circular mound in the vicinity
    yielded even more remarkable specimens of this singular flattening or
    compression. Two specimens presented unprecedented proportions; the
    transverse diameter of one shaft being 0.42 and the other 0.40 of the
    antero-posterior diameter. The circular mound yielded eleven skeletons
    besides a large number of burial vases and stone implements of all
    descriptions peculiar to the mounds. Of the crania from this mound we
    shall speak in Chapter IV. In 1872, Mr. Gillman examined a remarkable
    group of tumuli situated at the head of St. Clair River. These mostly
    stand on the shores of Lake Huron. The relics, besides human remains,
    consisted of pieces of mica, and necklaces of beads of the teeth of
    the moose alternating with well-wrought beads of copper. The same
    peculiarity of flattened <i>tibiæ</i> was markedly prominent in the
    remains.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The same investigator has examined mounds at Ottawa Point,
    Michigan, near the mouth of the Oqueoc River, at Point La Barbe in the
    Straits of Mackinac, and at Beaver Harbor on Beaver Island in Lake
    Michigan. Excepting ancient copper mines, no known works extend as far
    north as Lake Superior anywhere in the central region. Farther to the
    North-west, however, the works of the same people are comparatively
    numerous. Dr. Foster quotes a British Columbia newspaper, without
    giving either name or date, as authority for the discovery of a large
    number of mounds, seemingly the works of the same people who built
    farther east and south.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> On the Butte Prairies <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>of Oregon Wilkes and

  <p>Lewis and Clarke, in the Journal of their expedition up the Missouri
    River, describe the remains of fortifications on Bonhomme Islands at
    as early a date as 1804–5–6, but until recently their statements have
    been received with a degree of doubt.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This doubt has, however,
    been fully set at rest by the members of the United States Geological
    Surveying Expedition of 1872. Not only has it been shown that works
    exist at Bonhomme’s Island, but all the way up through the Yellowstone
    region and on the upper tributaries of the Missouri mounds are found
    in profusion.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Dr. C. Thomas, of the above-named expedition, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>made
    interesting discoveries in Dakota Territory, near the Northern Pacific
    Railroad crossing of the James River. Mounds were examined giving
    evidence of perhaps greater antiquity than those common in the interior
    of the country, if their contents be depended upon as furnishing a
    means of test.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The Missouri <span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>valley seems to have been one of the
    most populous branches of the wide-spread Mound-builder country. The
    valleys of its affluents, the Platte and Kansas rivers, also furnish
    evidence that these streams served as the channels into which flowed
    a part of the tide of population which either descended or ascended
    the Missouri. The Mississippi and Ohio river valleys, however, formed
    the great central arteries of the Mound-builder domain. In Wisconsin
    we find the northern central limit of their works; occasionally on the
    western shores of Lake Michigan, but in great numbers in the southern
    counties of the State, and especially on the lower Wisconsin River.
    The peculiar and fantastic forms of most of these mounds have led some
    writers to suppose that they belonged to a different race from that
    which occupied the valleys to the south. Instead of the usual type of
    the pyramid and circle, these remains mostly represent animals, or
    birds, or men. Still Dr. Lapham, who has described them fully in his
    admirable work<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> on the <cite>Antiquities of Wisconsin</cite>, concluded
    that sufficient resemblances between these remains and those of the
    south exist to ascribe to them a common origin. A few instances of the
    circle and square are found in association with the animal mounds,
    while in Ohio, on Brush Creek in Adams <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>County, the “Great Serpent,”
    and the “Alligator” in Licking County furnish proof that either the
    same people built them or at least the same impulses, religious or
    otherwise, actuated the people of both districts. The former of the
    above figures is well described by its name, “with its head conforming
    to the crest of a hill, and its body winding back for 700 feet in
    graceful undulations, terminating in a triple coil at the tail.”
    The length of the latter “from the point of the nose following the
    curves of the tail to the tip, is about 250 feet, the breadth of the
    body forty feet and the length of the legs or paws each thirty-six
    feet.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Until recently no effigy mounds were believed exist further
    south than <span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>Ohio; however, Mr. C. C. Jones, Jr., in the <cite>Smithsonian
    Report</cite> for 1877 has shown this to be a mistake. Mr. Jones describes
    an eagle-shaped stone mound north of Eatonton, in Putnam Co., Georgia,
    of the following dimensions: Height of tumulus at the breast of the
    bird, seven or eight feet; length from the top of the head to the
    extremity of the tail, 102 feet; distance from tip to tip of the wings,
    120 feet; greatest expanse of tail, 38 feet. A careful regard to the
    proportions of the bird are shown. A similar stone mound, of nearly the
    same proportions, was found near Lawrence Ferry on the Oconee River
    in Putnam County. In this instance a circle of stones encloses the
    effigy. At Trenton, Wisconsin, and in many other places examined by
    Dr. Lapham, cruciform works were found, some of which were constructed
    with the arms extending toward the cardinal points.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Instances of
    extinct or unknown animal forms occur occasionally: one instance is
    that of an animal somewhat resembling a monkey, having a body of about
    160 feet in length, while the tail describes a semicircle and measures
    alone 320 feet.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The most remarkable instance of the kind, however,
    is that of the big elephant mound found a few miles below the mouth
    of the Wisconsin River, so perfect in its proportions and complete in
    its representations of an elephant that its builders must have been
    well acquainted with all the physical characteristics of the animal
    which they delineated.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This fact suggests the inquiry whether these
    people were Asiatic in origin and penetrated to the interior of the
    country before their recollections of the elephant were forgotten,
    or whether they were contemporaneous with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> the mastodon of North
    America? In the remarkable works at Aztlan, Dr. Lapham finds not only
    resemblances to the Ohio antiquities, but striking analogies with those
    of Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

  <p>Across the Mississippi in Minnesota and Iowa, the predominant type
    of circular tumuli prevail, extending throughout the latter State to
    the Missouri. There are evidences that the Upper Missouri region was
    connected with that of the Upper Mississippi by settlements occupying
    the intervening country. Mounds are found even in the valley of the Red
    River of the North.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

  <p>Eastern Iowa, especially in the neighborhood of Davenport, has
    furnished some of the most interesting mounds that have yet been
    examined. Several gentlemen—especially Rev. Mr. Gass—of the Davenport
    Academy of Sciences have within a couple of years recovered a number of
    fine specimens of copper axes, nearly all wrapped in Mound-builder’s
    cloth. This cloth had been “preserved by the antiseptic action of
    the salts of copper, in all probability of the carbonates. In all
    specimens one thread of the warp is double or twisted, and there are
    about four to the one-fourth of an inch.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Stone pipes of excellent
    workmanship carved to represent various animals were found. Pottery,
    copper beads in considerable numbers, mica and sea-shells (Pyrula and
    Cassis), one which had an internal capacity of 152 cubic inches, or
    five and one-half pints, were among the relics recovered. Most of the
    human remains were much decayed; although some, among them a skull,
    were preserved. The character of the Altar mound in this group is
    rather unusual. Within the mound hewn rectangular stones were laid upon
    one another with perfect regularity, so as to break joints, forming
    something resembling the exterior appearance of a chimney. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>We are not
    aware of any similarly shaped altar ever having been discovered in the
    mounds. The most remarkable discovery of all, however, was made January
    10, 1877, by Rev. Mr. Gass and his assistants in one of the mounds
    which previously had been examined in part. Two tablets of coal slate
    covered with a variety of figures and hieroglyphics were found.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> One
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>of these, the larger, is of a most interesting character. On one side,
    as will be seen in the accompanying cut, a number of persons with hands
    joined have formed a semicircle around a mound, upon which a fire has
    been kindled, probably for the purpose of sacrifice, or for converting
    into a hardened and water-proof covering the layer of clay which may
    have been spread over the remains of some distinguished personage
    beneath. The presence of a layer of baked clay above human remains
    in so many Ohio mounds leads to this conjecture. The three prostrate
    human figures may be those of wives or servants of the deceased, to be
    sacrificed upon his grave, as has been the custom from the remotest
    times in India and among many savage tribes. The conspicuousness of
    the sun, moon, and stars, suggest even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> a sadder thought, that perhaps
    it may be purely a religious ceremony in which human victims are being
    offered to the heavenly bodies. Sabine worship, which spread throughout
    the entire length of the continent, is known to have been accompanied
    with the most horrid rites. Above the arch of the firmament are
    hieroglyphics which if deciphered no doubt would tell of the nature of
    this and other similar scenes. On the reverse side of the tablet is a
    rude representation of a hunting scene in which various animals, such
    as the buffalo cow, deer, bear, etc., etc., are figured. It has been
    conjectured that a large animal in the upper left-hand corner may be a
    mammoth, but there is little ground for the supposition. The scene is
    probably a representation of the exploits of the person buried in the
    mound. The smaller tablet is evidently a calendar stone with signs of
    the zodiac regularly marked upon it; of this calendar we shall speak in
    a future chapter. The above conjectures as to the significance of the
    representations on these tablets are based upon the supposition that
    they are genuine and not the work of an impostor, of which we cannot
    refrain from expressing a slight suspicion. That Rev. Mr. Gass has
    given a true account of his discovery there cannot be the slightest
    doubt—that he and his co-laborers in the work of excavation believe
    them to be genuine is equally certain.</p>

  <p>Descending to the interior, we find the heart of the Mound-builder
    country in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. It is uncertain whether its
    vital centre was in Southern Illinois or in Ohio—probably the former
    because of its geographical situation with reference to the mouths of
    the Missouri and Ohio Rivers. To enter upon a detailed description
    of the antiquities of this remarkable region would alone more than
    occupy the entire limits which we have prescribed for this work. This
    undertaking has already been well performed by Atwater, Squier and
    Davis, Foster, Baldwin, and many others. We shall therefore confine
    our remarks to notices of the most conspicuous remains and the general
    peculiarities of Mound-builder architecture. This people possessed
    a due appreciation of the physical advantages of certain localities
    for their cities. The site of St. Louis was formerly covered with
    mounds, one of which was thirty-five feet high,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> while in the American
    bottom on the Illinois side of the river their number approximates two
    hundred. In a group of sixty or more, lying between Alton and East St.
    Louis, stands the most magnificent of all the Mound-builders’ works,
    the great Mound of Cahokia, which rises to a height of ninety-seven
    feet and extends its huge mass in the form of a parallelogram, with
    sides measuring 700 and 500 feet respectively. On the south-west<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> there
    was a terrace 160 by 300 feet, reached by means of a graded way. The
    summit of the pyramid is truncated, affording a platform of 200 by 450
    feet. Upon this platform stands a conical mound ten feet high. Dr.
    Foster remarks: “It is probable that upon this platform was reared a
    capacious temple, within whose walls the high-priests gathered from
    different quarters at stated seasons, celebrating their mystic rites,
    whilst the swarming multitude below looked up with mute adoration.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
    When we consider the analogy between the general features of this
    pyramid and that on which the temple of Mexico was situated, it is not
    unnatural to reflect that Cahokia may have served as the prototype of
    the more magnificent structure which was so often deluged with the
    blood of its thousands of human victims. The temple of Mexico and many
    others of its type may have been the embodiment of the same principles
    of architecture employed at Cahokia, but carried to greater perfection
    under the more favorable conditions afforded in the valley of Anahuac,
    or precisely the reverse may be true. Such speculations are, however,
    more easily set forth than sustained. Dr. Foster, through a mistake,
    states that the monster mound has been removed. This, we are happy to
    say, is not the case.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

  <p>Numerous interesting explorations have been conducted recently in
    Illinois with rich results. Among the most notable of these are the
    discoveries of Mr. Henry R. Howland, reported in a paper read before
    the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences, March, 1877 (<cite>Bulletin of
    the Buffalo Soc. of Nat. Sc.</cite>, vol. iii., p. 204 <i>et seq.</i>).
    In January, 1876, Mr. Howland witnessed the removal of a mound near
    Mitchell Station in the American Bottom. In a stratum four or five
    feet from the base, composed chiefly of human bones, a large quantity
    of matting and a number of copper relics were disclosed to view. The
    matting was a coarse vegetable cane-like fibre simply woven, without
    twisting. Among the articles wrapped in the matting were several
    miniature tortoise shells formed of copper. They were of beaten copper
    of one sixty-fourth of an inch in thickness, the largest being but
    two and one-eighth inches in length. “A narrow flange or rim, about
    five thirty-secondths of an inch in width, is neatly turned at the
    base, and over the entire outer surface the curious markings peculiar
    to the tortoise shell are carefully produced by indentation—the
    entire workmanship evincing a delicate skill of which we have never
    before found traces in any discovered remains of the arts of the
    Mound-builders.” These shells were covered with several wrappings, the
    first and nearest to the shell proving to be of vegetable fibre, the
    second of a dark-brown color; when placed under the microscope and
    examined by Dr. G. J. Engleman and Sir Joseph Hooker, proved to be
    a very fine cloth woven from animal hair—of the rabbit and possibly
    of the deer. The third envelope was made from the intestine of some
    animal. The lower jaws of deer were discovered in which the forward
    part containing the teeth were encased in thin copper and wrapped in
    the fine hair-cloth just described. From holes bored in the back of
    each jaw, it is inferred that the articles were suspended from the
    neck as totems or badges of authority. Three wooden spool-like objects
    were found in the same place, partially plated with thin copper.
    Copper rods or needles from fourteen to eighteen inches in length, a
    beautiful shell necklace, and a spear head of chert a foot long, were
    also discovered. Among the rest were several sea-shells (<i>Busycon
    Perversum</i>), evidently brought from the Gulf a thousand miles
    distant. In the summer of 1874,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> Mr. H. R. Enoch, of Rockford, Ill.,
    discovered a tablet in a mound situated on the bank of Rock River,
    five miles south of Rockford. The “Rockford Tablet” created quite a
    sensation at first because it was thought to bear upon its face several
    symbols found upon the Mexican Calendar stone. However, a thorough
    investigation of its claims prove it to be a fraud, no doubt placed in
    the mound where discovered for the purpose of deception. Mr. J. Moody
    of Mendota, Ill., in referring to the twelve symbols of the tablet
    said to be Mexican, remarks: “Six are nearly exact counterparts of
    that number of Lybian characters which I find represented in Priest’s
    <cite>American Antiquities</cite>. * * * From a comparison of the Rockford
    Tablet with the plates in the work referred to above, the inference
    is almost irresistible that the engraver had a copy of Priest’s
    <cite>American Antiquities</cite> before him while doing his work.” (See
    <cite>Congrès International des Américanistes, Luxembourg</cite>, 1877. Tome
    ii, p. 160.)</p>

  <p>The same sagacity which chose the neighborhood of St. Louis for these
    works, covered the site of Cincinnati with an extensive system of
    circumvallations and mounds. Almost the entire space now occupied by
    the city was utilized by the mysterious builders in the construction
    of embankments and tumuli built upon the most accurate geometrical
    principles, and evincing keen military foresight.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Dr. Daniel Drake
    described these works in 1815, and many others subsequently.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The
    most important discovery made among these remains was that of the
    “Cincinnati Tablet” in 1841. This singular relic was taken from a large
    mound formerly thirty-five feet high, removed at the above date from
    the extension of Mound Street across Fifth <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>Street. When found, it was
    lying on a level with the original surface under the skull of a much
    decayed skeleton, with two polished, pointed bones about seven inches
    long, and a bed of charcoal and ashes. This stone in all probability
    served the double purpose of a record of the calendar and a scale
    for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> measurement.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Mr. E. Gest, the courteous owner of the tablet,
    provided the accompanying cuts expressly for this work, regarding them
    as the first correct representations of the stone.</p>

  <p>The vast number as well as the magnitude of the works found in the
    State of Ohio, have surprised the most careless and indifferent
    observers. It is estimated by the most conservative, and Messrs.
    Squier and Davis among them, that the number of tumuli <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>in Ohio equals
    10,000, and the number of enclosures 1000 or 1500. In Ross County
    alone, 100 enclosures and upwards of 500 mounds have been examined.
    Some of the works exhibit fine engineering skill; such, for instance,
    are those near Liberty, Ohio, where two embankments, each forming a
    perfect circle, are found in conjunction with a perfect square. The
    larger circle measures 1700 feet in diameter and contains forty acres,
    while the smaller has a diameter of 800 feet. The square contains
    twenty-seven acres and measures 1080 feet on each side. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> set of
    works in Pike County consists of a circle enclosing a square, the
    four corners of which each touch the circular embankment. The opening
    or doorway through the circle is opposite the opening in the square.
    Prof. E. B. Andrews found a conical mound enclosed by a circle, the
    base of the mound reaching to the edge of the ditch outside of which
    is the circular wall. The mound was located on the Hocking River,
    nine miles northward of Lancaster, Ohio (see <cite>Tenth Ann. Rep. of
    Peabody Mus. of Arch. and Eth.</cite>, p. 51). The works at Hopetown, near
    Chillicothe, present several combinations of the square and circle.
    The two principal figures of these works are a square and circle—each
    containing exactly twenty acres. The discovery of these geometrical
    combinations—executed with such precision—in many parts of the country,
    lead to the belief that the Mound-builders were one people spread over
    a large territory, possessed of the same institutions, religion, and
    perhaps one government. These facts are highly important as shedding
    light upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> degree of their civilization. The evidence is ample
    that they were possessed of regular scales of measurement, of the means
    of determining angles and of computing the area to be enclosed by a
    square and circle, so that the space enclosed by these figures standing
    side by side might exactly correspond. In a word, their scientific and
    mathematical knowledge was of a very respectable order.</p>

  <p>The military works of the Mound-builders, other than those previously
    mentioned as existing on the Lakes and in Western New York State,
    are of a twofold character, consisting first of fortified eminences,
    of which an instance is found in Butler County, Ohio, where 16³⁄₁₀
    acres are walled in on the summit of a hill, and the entrance to the
    enclosure guarded by a complicated system of covered ways. On Paint
    Creek, Ross County, a remarkable stone work encloses 140 acres, in
    the centre of which was an artificial lake, probably to supply water
    in case of a siege. Perhaps the most remarkable fortification left by
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> Mound-builders is that known as Fort Ancient, Ohio, on the Little
    Miami River, forty-two miles north-east of Cincinnati. The specialist
    is already familiar with the oft-quoted description of the Survey by
    Prof. Locke, made in 1843. We will therefore only refer to a few of
    the measurements contained in that description. “The work occupies
    a terrace on the left bank of the river, two hundred and thirty
    feet above its waters. The place is naturally a strong one, being a
    peninsula defended by two ravines, which, originating on the east side,
    near to each other, diverging and sweeping around, enter the Miami,
    the one above, the other below the work. The Miami itself, with its
    precipitous bank of two hundred feet, defends the western side.” * *
    * “The whole circuit of this work is between four and five miles. The
    number of cubic yards of excavation may be approximately estimated
    at 628,800”. The embankment stands in many places twenty feet in
    perpendicular height. The most interesting and valuable paper on this
    work is that by Mr. L. M. Hosea, of Cincinnati, in the <cite>Quarterly
    Journal of Science</cite> (Cincinnati), October, 1874, p. 289 <i>et
    seq.</i> This writer observes that it has often been remarked that
    the form of Fort Ancient resembles a rude outline of the continent of
    North and South America. None of the mounds contained in the enclosure
    have yielded any relics of special interest. The greatest possible
    diversity of opinion exists concerning the antiquity of the abandonment
    of the works. Judges Dunlevy and Force, the latter in his memoir on the
    <cite>Mound-builders</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> estimate the period as a thousand <span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>years,
    while Mr. Hosea thinks several thousand years would be required to
    produce the numerous little hillocks and depressions which mark the
    spot where trees have grown, fallen and decayed. Reasoning from other
    data, we are inclined to the more conservative opinion of Judge Force
    as altogether the safer. Fort Ancient, which could have held a garrison
    of 60,000 men with their families and provisions, was one of a line
    of fortifications which extend across the State and served to check
    the incursion of the savages of the North in their descent upon the
    Mound-builder country.</p>

  <p>The second class of military works, which are exceedingly numerous on
    all the watercourses—existing not only on the Ohio and Mississippi, but
    on all their tributaries, especially on the Muskingum, Scioto, Miami,
    Wabash, Illinois, Kentucky, and minor streams—are mounds which served
    as outlooks. These were always placed in positions to command extended
    views, and from which signals could be given to still others of the
    same character, or probably to settlements remote from the watercourses.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp55">

  </div>

  <p>A system of these works no doubt formerly existed on the Great Miami
    River extending north of Dayton, Ohio, southward to the Ohio River, and
    connected with the great settlement on the site of Cincinnati and with
    the high bluffs on the Kentucky shore. The great Mound at Miamisburgh,
    ten miles south of Dayton, formed a part of this chain. This monster
    mound is sixty-eight feet high and 852 feet in circumference, and may
    have served the double purpose of a signal station and the base of a
    small edifice devoted to astronomical or religious purposes. There is
    little doubt that the Mound-builders in the latter period of their
    occupancy of this region, when apprehensive of danger from their
    enemies, employed a system of signal telegraph by which communication
    was had, through means of the watch-fire or the torch, between
    localities as distant as those now occupied by Cincinnati and Dayton.
    Only a few minutes were necessary by means of such a perfected system
    in which to transmit a signal fifty or one hundred miles. Squier and
    Davis remark on this subject: “There seems to have existed a system of
    defences extending from the sources of the Alleghany and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> Susquehanna
    in New York, diagonally across the country, through Central and
    Northern Ohio to the Wabash. Within this range the works which are
    regarded as defensive are largest and most numerous.” The signal system
    we have reason to believe was employed throughout the entire extent
    of this range of works. The majority of the enclosures found in the
    Ohio and Mississippi valleys are presumed not to have been designed
    for military purposes, since the trench is usually <em>inside</em> of
    the embankment. However, instances of the trench being outside of the
    parapet occur in Southern Ohio.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The most magnificent Mound-builder
    remains in Ohio are the extensive and intricate works near Newark in
    Licking County. The survey made by Col. Whittlesey and published in
    the <cite>Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley</cite>, is the most
    reliable as well as the fullest source of our information concerning
    their magnitude, though the plan has been corrected considerably by
    more recent surveys. These works occupy an area of two miles square,
    and formerly consisted of twelve miles of embankment. The spacious
    gateways—one of which has embankments on both sides measuring
    thirty-five feet in height from the bottom of the interior trench—the
    labyrinthine system of avenues, the strangely-shaped mounds, one
    of which resembles a huge bird-track with a middle toe 155 feet in
    length and the remaining two each 110 feet in length—together with
    the solitude of the ancient forest which entombed this buried city,
    we confess impressed us with a sense of wonderment and that strange
    perplexity which an insoluble mystery exercises over the mind. We
    can appreciate the remark of Mr. Squier in his description: “Here
    covered with the gigantic <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>trees of a primitive forest, the work
    truly presents a grand and impressive appearance; and in entering
    the ancient avenue for the first time, the visitor does not fail to
    experience a sensation of awe, such as he might feel in passing the
    portals of an Egyptian temple, or in gazing upon the ruins of Petra of
    the Desert.” It is estimated that a force of thousands of men assisted
    by modern appliances and implements as well as horse-power, which the
    Mound-builder did not possess, would require several months in which
    to construct these works.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> At Marietta a most interesting system of
    works exist, covering an area three-fourths of a mile long and half
    a mile broad. These occupy the river terrace or second bottom at the
    confluence of the Muskingum River with the Ohio, and present analogies
    with the works further south and with those of Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Two
    irregular squares inclose fifty and twenty-seven acres respectively.
    The walls of the larger are between five and six feet high and from
    twenty to thirty feet wide at the base. Within an enclosure are four
    truncated pyramids or platforms, one of which, the largest, is 188 feet
    long, 132 feet wide, and only 10 feet high, with a graded way reaching
    to its summit, as have also two of the other pyramids. No one can look
    at these structures without seeing the force of Lewis H. Morgan’s
    Pueblo theory,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> which makes these mounds or flattened pyramidal
    elevations the foundation for edifices of a perishable nature;
    constructed perhaps of hewn wood, but not of a combination of the adobe
    and wood as he supposes, since no material for such a combination is
    found in the Ohio valley.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The most elevated of the Marietta works
    is an elliptical mound thirty feet high, enclosed by an embankment.</p>

  <p>The most recent and satisfactory exploration of mounds in Ohio, was
    that conducted by Prof. E. B. Andrews for the Peabody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> Museum of
    American Archæology and Ethnology, and published in the Tenth Annual
    Report of the Trustees (Cambridge, 1877). The mounds examined are in
    Fairfield, Perry, Athens, and Hocking Counties. In Fairfield County
    they were all located upon hills and commanded extensive views. Their
    contents indicated great age, being much decayed. At New Lexington in
    Perry County, ancient flint diggings, unquestionably worked by the
    Mound-builders, were examined, many of the pits being six to eight feet
    deep. In Athens County, on Wolf Plain, situated in Athens and Dover
    Townships, several circles and nineteen conical mounds are found. One
    of the latter measures forty feet high, with a diameter of 170 feet,
    and contains 437.742 cubic feet. Another, known as the Beard Mound, was
    excavated, and the interesting fact discovered that in its construction
    the dirt had been “thrown down in small quantities—averaging about a
    peck—as if from a basket.” Prof. Andrews is of the opinion that the
    mound was a long time in building, “for we find,” he remarks, “at
    many different levels, the proof that grasses and other vegetation
    grew rankly upon the earth heap and were buried by the dirt.” In a
    neighboring mound known as the George Connett Mound, under a bed of
    charcoal five feet below the summit, a skeleton was found in a box or
    coffin, enclosed by timbers. The upper part of the coffin and middle of
    the body had been destroyed by fire. A circle of five hundred copper
    beads was found around the body. A copper instrument resembling a
    calker’s chisel, measuring 141 mm. in length, width at flattened end,
    52 mm., diameter of cylindrical part, 20 mm. The instrument was formed
    from sheet copper, beaten with such care that no traces of the hammer
    are visible. “The edges are brought together and united very closely
    by a slight overlap.” Professor Andrews describes and figures a piece
    of leather ornamented with oval copper beads taken from a point eight
    feet below the surface of a mound designated as the “school-house
    mound.” The original piece measured eight or ten inches square, but
    unfortunately fell into the hands of bystanders, who tore it in pieces
    for relics. The Professor regards the curiosity as of Mound-builder
    origin, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> thinks it belonged to an ornamented dress. We cannot
    detail these interesting explorations here, and must dismiss them with
    the deduction that in certain cases the cremation of the bodies found
    in mounds was accidental, caused by the heat penetrating through a
    layer of earth on which a fire had been kindled. In other instances,
    the body seems to have been burned intentionally, and the ashes and
    charred bones heaped together in the centre of the mound. Some clay and
    stone tubes of fine workmanship were obtained. The same document above
    cited contains a valuable paper by Mr. Lucian Carr on his interesting
    exploration of a mound in Lee County, Virginia.</p>

  <p>Grave Creek Mound, situated twelve miles below Wheeling in West
    Virginia, is the Monster work of the Ohio Valley. It measures seventy
    feet in height and nine hundred feet in circumference. Its form is that
    of a truncated cone, the flattened area on the top being fifty feet in
    diameter.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The States of Indiana<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and Illinois formed with Ohio
    a portion of the great centre of the Mound-builder country, as the
    remains found on the watercourses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> of both States testify. The valleys
    of the Wabash, Kankakee, Illinois and Saline Rivers were the once
    populous dwelling-places of a thrifty and industrious people who have
    left thousands of structures behind them.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The Alleghany Mountains,
    the natural limit of the great Mississippi basin, appears to have
    served as the eastern and south-eastern boundary of the Mound-builder
    country. In Western New York, Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
    and in all of Kentucky and Tennessee, their remains are numerous
    and in some instances imposing. In Tennessee especially, the works
    of the Mound-builders are of the most interesting character. Prof.
    Joseph Jones, of the University of New Orleans, has by his thorough
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>and recent explorations under the patronage of the Smithsonian
    Institution, brought to light very interesting materials for the study
    of the history of this people. The works of defence in the shape
    of stone forts, by some thought to be peculiar to New York and the
    lake boundaries, with occasional exceptions in the Ohio Valley, have
    been found to abound in Coffee and other counties. One very perfect
    example of this kind of fortification, but very imperfectly described
    and figured by Haywood,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> is that known as the stone fort near
    Manchester, Tenn. This enclosure, containing over fifty-four acres, has
    been minutely described by Prof. Jones.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In the accompanying cut
    the reader will obtain a pretty clear idea of the form of this fort.
    The wall, which varies from four to ten feet in height, is composed
    of loose rocks gathered apparently from the bed of the streams below,
    and the vicinity. The ditch shown in the cut at the rear of the works
    was probably designed to convey water from one creek to the other.
    The entrance is quite complicated and constitutes the most remarkable
    feature of the fortification.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

  <p>One peculiarity of burial noticeable in this locality, and one
    which evidently indicates progression when we come to compare these
    people with those farther north, is the fact that the ancient race of
    Tennessee buried their dead in rude stone coffins or cists, constructed
    of flat pieces of limestone or slaty sandstone which abound in the
    central portions of the State. In most of the mounds this mode of
    burial prevailed, but was not confined to them, for outside of the
    mounds in many enclosures a large number of stone graves occur. Of
    the class of “Stone-grave Burial Mounds”, one situated twelve miles
    from Nashville, near Brentwood, is worthy of mention. This mound was
    about forty-five feet in diameter by twelve feet high, and contained
    one hundred skeletons. These were mostly in stone graves, which were
    constructed in ranges one above another, three or four deep. The lower
    graves were short and square, containing bones that had apparently
    been deposited after the flesh had been removed. The upper graves
    were full length and contained remains in which the bones occupied
    their natural relation to each other. The workmanship both of the
    mound and stone cists was of the most perfect character. The lids
    of the upper stone cists were so arranged as to present a perfectly
    rounded, sloping rock surface. The mound was situated on the eastern
    slope of a beautiful hill, covered with a heavy growth of the native
    forest. In a large and carefully constructed stone tomb, Prof. Jones
    discovered the skeleton of an aged individual of immense length, having
    toothless jaw bones. In a grave occupied by a skeleton of a female,
    a small compartment or stone box was found near the head, separated
    from the main coffin by stone slabs, in which was the skeleton of an
    infant. It should be added that in the square or short graves so often
    met with, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> skull was placed in the centre and the other bones
    arranged around it.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Numerous stone graves not covered by mounds
    were found on the Cumberland River opposite the mouth of Lick Branch,
    surrounding a chain of four mounds. A similar graveyard was found
    on the same bank of the Cumberland, a mile and a half farther down.
    Others were met with on White Creek, nine miles from Nashville, at
    Sycamore in Cheatham County; at Brentwood, in White County near Sparta,
    and along the tributaries of the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers at
    short intervals. At Oldtown on the Big Harpeth, is an extensive and
    remarkable collection of stone graves. All these burial grounds seem
    to be those of the people who constructed the mounds, for most of the
    mounds examined contained stone <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>graves, not in their upper strata, but
    on the level of the surrounding land. A mound opposite Nashville, on
    the east bank of the Cumberland River, of great interest, was examined.
    Prof. Jones is convinced that it formerly served as the site or base
    of a temple. Its dimensions were one hundred feet in diameter by only
    ten feet high. In the centre of the mound and only three feet from its
    surface the Professor uncovered a large sacrificial vase or altar,
    forty-three inches in diameter, composed of a mixture of clay and
    river-shells. The rim of this flat earthen vessel or sacrificial altar
    was three inches in height and appeared mathematically circular. The
    surface of the “altar” was covered by a layer of ashes about one inch
    in thickness. The antlers and jaw-bone of a deer were found resting on
    the surface of the altar, and it is probable that part of the animal
    had been consumed as a sacrifice. The whole had been carefully covered
    with three feet of earth and the ashes preserved. In this mound rude
    sarcophagi were ranged around this sacred centre with the heads toward
    the altar and the feet toward the circumference of the circle, while
    the directions of the bodies were those of radii. Those bodies near
    the altar were ornamented with numerous beads of sea-shell and bone.
    In a carefully constructed stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> sarcophagus, in which the face of
    the skeleton was turned toward the setting sun, the beautiful shell
    ornament shown in the cut, measuring 4.4 inches in diameter, was found
    lying on the breast-bone of the skeleton. It was made from some large
    shell derived from the sea-coast. Of the numerous interesting places
    examined by Prof. Jones, the site of Oldtown, on the Big Harpeth River,
    about six miles south-west of Franklyn, Tennessee, is worthy of special
    attention. The plan of the works and their general dimensions will be
    seen in the cut. At present, the crescent-shaped wall of 2470 feet in
    extent is but from two to six feet in height, having been reduced to
    its present condition by the plowshare. Thirty years ago it is said
    to have been so steep that it was impossible to ride a horse over
    it. Within the enclosure are two pyramidal mounds; the larger is one
    hundred and twelve by sixty-five feet and eleven feet high, and the
    smaller, seventy by sixty feet by nine feet high; also a small burial
    mound measuring thirty by twenty feet and 2.5 feet high. Another burial
    mound is covered by the residence of the owner, Mr. Thomas Brown. Many
    curiously-shaped clay vessels were obtained at these works by the
    explorers. Some of the vases were fashioned into effigies of frogs and
    various animals, and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> vase obtained by Mr. Brown in excavating for
    the foundation for his residence, had a neck terminating in two human
    heads. Some of the vessels from Oldtown are figured in the cut.</p>

  <p>The art of painting seems to have been extensively practised by the
    mound people of Tennessee, not only in the decoration of pottery, but
    in representing ideal conceptions, which they spread out in extensive
    pictures upon the smooth faces of rocky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> walls overhanging the rivers.
    The material generally used was <em>red ochre</em>. Prof. Jones says:
    “The painting representing the sun on the rocks overhanging the Big
    Harpeth River, about three miles below the road which crosses this
    stream and connects Nashville and Charlotte, can be seen for a distance
    of four miles, and it is probable that the worshippers of the sun
    assembled before this high place for the performance of their sacred
    rites.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The Professor’s vast collection of relics in stone and
    clay, including several images, we cannot here describe. We refer the
    reader to the Memoir itself. The Professor has clearly shown that the
    Mound-builder people and the Indians were distinct, and has set at
    rest a question upon which some few doubts were still entertained by
    a certain school of Archæologists, which has really never been very
    strong. The connection with or identity of the Mound-builders and the
    Toltics or the same family of people is also shown satisfactorily. We
    will add that the Professor is disposed to consider the Natchez as the
    connecting link between the Mound-builders and the Nahuas. We regard
    the Memoir one of the most important which has ever appeared on the
    subject of mound exploration. The rich collection of crania will be
    referred to in a future chapter.</p>

  <p>In September, 1877, Prof. F. W. Putnam and Mr. Edwin Curtiss, also
    a party under Major Powell excavated a large number of mounds and
    stone graves, mostly in the neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee. The
    results were substantially the same as those obtained by Prof. Jones.
    Prof. Putnam found within an earthwork near Lebanon, in Wilson County,
    sixty miles east of Nashville, what he considers to be the remains of
    dwellings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> of the Mound-builders. There were circular ridges of earth
    varying from a few inches to a little over three feet in height, with
    diameters ranging from ten to fifty feet. Within these enclosures, a
    few inches below the surface, hard floors, upon which fires had been
    made, were discovered. Under these floors, in many instances, infants
    and children had been buried, while the adults had been interred in a
    neighboring mound. Accompanying the skeletons of the children, many
    beautiful vessels of strange and artistic forms were found (cuts of
    three of these were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> kindly furnished by Prof. Putnam for this work),
    all evincing the tenderness with which the offspring of this people
    were regarded. Prof. Putnam examined nineteen of the earth-circles,
    which he adds, “proved to my satisfaction that the ridges were formed
    by the decay of the walls of a circular dwelling. * * * These houses
    had probably consisted of a frail circular structure, the decay of
    which would only leave a slight elevation, the formation of the ridge
    being assisted by the refuse from the house.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

  <p>Colonies of Mound-builders seem to have passed the great natural
    barrier into North Carolina and left remains in Marion County, while
    still others penetrated into South Carolina and built on the Wateree
    River. In March, 1873, Mr. Jas. R. Page examined several mounds in
    Washington and Issaquena Counties in the State of Mississippi. One
    mound explored in Washington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> County on the old bank of the Mississippi
    River, was a truncated cone eighty feet in diameter by forty feet
    high. A mound in the neighborhood, only eleven feet high, yielded
    rich returns for the labors of excavation. A white oak on its summit
    measured thirty-six inches in diameter. This mound yielded twelve
    skeletons with their crania. The group was in a sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> posture around
    a circle, with their faces looking toward its centre. Directly in
    front of the mouth of each skeleton were placed two or three vessels
    of pottery, beautifully ornamented with etchings and graceful lines.
    The object of the vessels, placed in such near proximity to the mouths
    of the buried remains, can only be conjectured. We regret that no
    measurements of the crania are given, and what is more, we deplore the
    loss of most of the crania in the course of their transportation.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
    Mr. W. Marshall Anderson, of Circleville, Ohio, examined Mounds in
    Issaquena County, Miss., with interesting results; in one mound
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>opened, not far from its outer edge, three skeletons were found
    buried in a standing position, as though they had acted as the guards
    of a more distinguished person deposited in the centre. Penetrating
    the mound still farther by means of a trench, Mr. Anderson reached a
    large deposit of ashes and burnt earth. Near the centre of the mound
    and five feet above the level of the earth, upwards of twenty-five
    unbroken specimens of fine pottery were discovered. At the very centre
    three individuals had been buried apparently in great state, with
    all the insignia of their important positions in life. These were
    ornaments, urns, vases, beads, and arrow-points; while adjoining the
    heads of each were food and drinking vessels. Not far removed from
    these, two skeletons were found with bowls placed upon their heads
    like helmets. Mr. Anderson is the possessor of a very remarkable stone
    disk obtained for him by Dr. Robinson from a Issaquena mound near
    Lake Washington, Miss. The disk is nearly eight and a half inches
    in diameter and three-quarters of an inch thick, of fine-grained
    sandstone. The device which it bears upon its face is composed of two
    entwined rattlesnakes. A trifling ornamental border is graven on the
    reverse side of the disk. When found it was broken in two pieces. Mr.
    Anderson, in comparing its strange device to the Aztec Calendar Stone,
    remarks: “Here are the eighteen pipes of the border corresponding to
    the eighteen months of the year, but the twenty days of the month and
    the five intercalaries are not to be found. The thirteen hieroglyphical
    figures, and the four zodiacal signs, which as multiples give the
    fifty-two years of the Aztec cycle, are also absent on the Mississippi
    stone.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The serpent-symbol appears to have played its part among
    the Mound-builders, as well as in Mexico and Central America. The great
    serpent of Adams County, Ohio, is the most extensive delineation of
    the all-important symbol on the continent. Out of eighteen engraved
    circular plates made of the shell of the Pyrula and taken from
    Brakebill and Lick Creek Mounds in East Tennessee (and now deposited
    in the Peabody Museum of Archæology) thirteen bear the device of a
    rattlesnake. In one of the mounds of “Mound City,” Ross County, Ohio,
    several small tablets representing the rattlesnake were unearthed,
    while other mounds in the same locality yielded pipes bearing the same
    representation.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

  <p>On the Southern Mississippi, in the area embraced between the
    termination of the Cumberland Mountains near Florence and Tuscumbia in
    Alabama and the mouth of Big Black River, this people left numerous
    works, many of which were of a remarkable character.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The whole
    region bordering on the tributaries of the Tombigbee, the country
    through which the Wolf River flows and that watered by the Yazoo River
    and its affluents, was densely populated by the same people who built
    mounds in the Ohio Valley. Mr. Fontaine describes the mounds of this
    region and of the Tennessee River Valley as being most frequently of
    the truncated pyramidal type, and refers to one (seen by him in 1847)
    seventy feet high, covering an acre of ground. It is remarkable that
    the entire valley of the great river from Cairo to the mouth of Pointe
    à la Hache, fifty miles below New Orleans, is thickly studded with
    mounds.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> As at Cahokia the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>Monarch Mound occupied a space equal
    to six acres, so at Seltzertown, Mississippi, we have another immense
    mound covering nearly the same area. Its dimensions are: length, about
    six hundred feet; breadth, four hundred feet at the base; height,
    forty feet, with a summit nearly four acres in area, reached by means
    of a graded way. The structure lies with its greatest length nearly
    due east and west. Upon the platform summit are three conical mounds,
    one at each end and the third in the centre. The mound at the western
    extremity of the summit rises to a height of nearly forty feet, while
    the one at the opposite extreme does not fall far short of the same
    altitude. This would give a total height of eighty feet above the level
    of the base. Both of these mounds are truncated. Eight other mounds of
    minor proportions are observable. The most remarkable feature connected
    with this mound is a wall of sun-dried bricks, built two feet thick, as
    its support on the northern side. These were filled with grass rushes
    and leaves, while some of the bricks of great size used in angular
    tumuli which mark the corners of the mound, retain the impressions of
    human hands.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The Mound-builders were certainly numerous in the
    Gulf States east of the Mississippi. On the Etowah River in Alabama a
    mound seventy-five feet high and twelve hundred feet in diameter at the
    base, has a graded avenue leading to its flattened summit. It has close
    affinities to the Mexican and Yucatan mounds.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> M. F. Stephenson
    describes a group of ten mounds near Cartersville, Georgia, on the
    Etowah River, the principal one of which is eighty feet high and one
    hundred and fifty feet square on the top. A stone idol, gold beads,
    mica mirrors, translucent quartz beautifully wrought, and many relics
    of interest were here discovered. He also describes three chambers hewn
    out of the solid rock at the falls of Little River, near the Alabama
    line; while at Nacooche the crest of a conical hill was cut off at
    fifty feet from its base, leaving a platform top with an area of an
    acre and a half. Two sides are quite precipitous, but the others are
    protected by a ditch and wall. Two other instances of the stone wall
    are mentioned. First at Yond Mountain, four thousand feet high of solid
    granite, and perpendicular on all sides except a small space which
    is protected by a stone wall of artificial construction. The second
    instance is quite similar, occurring at Stone Mountain, which reaches a
    height of 2360 feet.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> These natural eminences no doubt were utilized
    for the purposes of worship or observation, just as many natural hills
    in Mexico were graded and shaped symmetrically to serve similar uses.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

  <p>Wm. McKinley, Esq., has described and surveyed additional works in
    Georgia of quite a remarkable character, on Sapelio Island in McIntosh
    County and on Dry Creek in Sacred Grove, Early County. But the most
    lofty work of all, the giant of the mounds, is the pyramid of Kolee
    Mokee in the same county, reaching a height of ninety-five feet and
    having a circumference at its base of 1128 feet. Its form is that of
    a parallelogram, 350 feet long and 214 wide. The plane on the summit
    measures 181 feet in length by 82½ feet in width.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In Florida the
    works of the Mound-builders have been extensively examined by Prof.
    Jeffries Wyman, to whose labors we shall refer in the next chapter.
    Dr. A. Mitchell made some interesting explorations in 1848 on Amelia
    Island, and was rewarded by the recovery of some well-marked mound
    crania.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

  <p>Returning to the confluence of the Missouri with the Mississippi,
    the point at which we left the western boundary of the Mound-builder
    country in order to treat the characteristics of its central region,
    we find mounds, as we previously stated, in great numbers in the
    neighborhood of St. Louis. In the valley of the St. Francis River,
    mounds that have been explored have yielded <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>many rich relics, artistic
    water vessels, vases and statuettes. In Green County, Missouri, N. Lat.
    37° 20´ and 16° Long, west of Washington City, is a very remarkable
    truncated conical mound which has only been externally surveyed. This
    mound is 60 feet high, 350 feet in diameter at the base, and 130 feet
    in diameter on the top. It is surrounded by a trench (except about
    twenty feet at the north) about two hundred feet wide and four feet
    deep. On the north the excavation is seven or eight feet deep.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
    These trenches served a double purpose—that of furnishing material for
    the construction of the mound, and when completed, of providing an
    impassable moat filled with water, that neither enemies nor the rabble
    might approach the sacred mount.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> In Phillips County, Prof. Cox
    discovered an ancient fortification near Helena, built like a part of
    the Seltzertown mound, of sun-dried bricks; stems and leaves of the
    cane were used instead of straw in making the bricks.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

  <p>Professor Swallow, in company with a number of scientific gentlemen,
    opened a large mound in Lewis’ Prairie, west of New Madrid, Missouri
    (in December, 1856), in which he found a great collection of earthen
    dishes and vases. The mound was elliptical in form, measuring 900
    feet in periphery at the base, 570 feet at the top and twenty feet in
    height. The remarkable feature of the mound was that it contained a
    room formed of poles, lathed with split cane and plastered with clay
    both inside and out, forming a solid mass. “Over this room was built
    the earthwork of the mound, so that when it was completed the room was
    in its centre. The earthwork was then coated with the plaster, and
    over all nature formed a soil. This mud plastering was left rough on
    the outside of the room, but smooth on the inside, which was painted
    with red ochre.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Some of the plastering was burned as red and hard
    as brick, while other parts were only sun-dried. Professor Swallow
    believes the mounds of the region to be very ancient. On mounds
    and neighboring embankments a sycamore tree twenty-eight feet in
    circumference, three feet above the ground, a black-walnut twenty-six
    feet in circumference, a white ash twelve feet and a chestnut oak
    eleven feet in circumference were observed. In addition to these
    evidences of age, the Professor states that six feet of stratified
    sands and clays have formed around the mounds since they were deserted.
    (See Eighth <cite>Annual Report of Peabody Museum</cite>, pp. 16 <i>et
    seq.</i> Cambridge, 1875.)</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

  <p>Mr. A. J. Conant, in a very able paper published in the <cite>Transactions
    of the St. Louis Academy of Sciences</cite> for April 5, 1876, has more
    fully described the mound works near New Madrid. On the western bank of
    the Bayou St. John, partly in a cypress swamp covered with heavy timber
    and partly on adjacent prairie land, an earthwork encloses an area of
    about fifty acres. In this enclosure are three large mounds, one of
    which is pyramidal in form and still has traces of a graded way. An
    ancient well is discernible near it. A circular mound at the opposite
    end of the enclosure is estimated by Mr. Conant to have afforded a
    place of burial for a thousand individuals. The bodies were buried with
    their heads pointing toward the centre of the mound. A gourd-shaped
    vase, a small jug or drinking vessel, and an earthen pan or platter
    was found with each skeleton. The mouths of the vases were fashioned
    into the form of the head of some bird or the figure of some animal or
    of a human female. In depressions about three feet deep, within the
    enclosure, remains of burnt clay ovens were found. Fire-places were
    disclosed, as well as fragments of earthen vessels capable of holding
    ten or twelve gallons. The veritable kitchens of the Mound-builders,
    with their furniture, seem to have been brought to light. In front of
    the enclosure and projecting out into the bayou, are tongues of land
    about thirty feet long by ten or fifteen feet in width, and about the
    same distance apart, “resembling upon a small scale the wharves of a
    seaport town.” Mr. Conant pronounces them artificial, and that when
    employed by these builders, the present cypress swamp was the channel
    of a river. The multitude of mound works which are scattered over the
    entire south-eastern portion of Missouri indicate that the region “was
    once inhabited by a population so numerous, that in comparison its
    present occupants are only as the scattered pioneers of a newly-settled
    country.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

  <p>Prof. C. G. Forshey in <cite>Foster’s Pre-Historic Races</cite>, presents
    most valuable information relative to the mounds in the south-west. His
    observations convince us that the State of Louisiana and the valleys of
    the Arkansas and Red Rivers were not only the most thickly populated
    wing of the Mound-builder domain, but also furnish us with remains
    presenting affinities with the great works of Mexico so striking that
    no doubt can longer exist that the same people were the architects
    of both. He describes works, some of them of immense proportions, on
    the Mississippi fifty <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>miles above Vicksburg; on Walnut Bayou; the
    south-west bend of Lake St. Joseph, and at Trinity in the parish of
    Catahoula, Louisiana. On the east bank of the Little River, a couple of
    miles above its mouth, where it empties into Lake Ocalohoola, stands a
    bluff walled with roughly hewn stone. The same writer observed a mound
    near Natchez twenty-five feet high, standing isolated in a swamp. This
    mound is one among many in different parts of the lower Mississippi
    region surmounted by comparatively younger trees than are found on the
    remains farther north. Works occur in the Atchafalaya basin, in the
    rear of Baton Rouge, on the uplands of Lake Pontchartrain and on the
    banks of Bayou Gros Tête. A remarkable group of truncated pyramids,
    peculiarly Mexican in their style of architecture, exist in Madison
    Parish, Louisiana, and are figured in Squier and Davis and copied
    by Foster.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It is needless to discuss the fact that the works of
    the Mound-builders exist in considerable numbers in Texas, extending
    across the Rio Grande into Mexico, establishing an unmistakable
    relationship as well as actual union between the truncated pyramids
    of the Mississippi Valley and the Tocalli of Mexico and the countries
    further south.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> There can be no doubt as to the unity of the origin
    of the works in both countries. There are evidences also that the most
    recent works of Louisiana and Texas do not compare in antiquity with
    any found in the Ohio Valley, showing it to be altogether probable
    that the Mound-builders occupied the Lower Mississippi Valley and
    Gulf coast for a considerable period after they were driven from the
    northern and central region by their enemies.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>Several recent
    writers, with no more proof than that obsidian from Mexico has been
    found in the mounds, have confidently expressed the belief that the
    Mound-builders entered the Mississippi Valley and the Central Region
    from the South. This was based also on the assumption that no remains
    were found in the North-west. It, however, is proper to note here the
    marks of architectural progression observable in the geographical
    distribution of ancient works. Men all around the world have been
    mound or pyramid builders. To attempt to demonstrate this well-known
    fact to an intelligent reader by citing the customs of antiquity and
    the works of the present great Asiatic nations, would seem little
    less than pedantry rather than the work of serious investigation. The
    religious idea in man, whether observed in the darkest heathenism or
    partially enlightened civilization, has always associated a place of
    sanctuary with the conditions of elevation and separateness. It matters
    not whether you apply the rule to the practices of the most obscure
    antiquity, where a hill or natural eminence was the sanctuary of an
    idol, the residence of a god, or examine the motives which prompt <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>the
    erection of the dome of a St. Paul or a St. Peter’s, or coming nearer
    home, analyze the reasons for the construction of the ordinary church
    spire, the same inexplicable intuition is found at the bottom of them
    all. The simple mound so common in the northern and central region
    of the United States, represents probably the first attempts at the
    imitation of nature in providing a place of worship. In the absence
    of hills and natural eminences on great plains like the prairies of
    the North-west (for instance in such cases as are cited on <a href="#Page_28">pages 28
    and 29</a>), nothing would be more natural than the construction of an
    artificial hillock, especially if the elements and nature were the
    objects of worship. The next step might have been again a copy or an
    imitation, but instead of choosing a subject from inanimate nature,
    an advance is made in the artistic scale, and the animal kingdom
    furnishes not only one but varied models for reproduction. The custom
    among savage tribes of personifying the deity, of dressing him up in
    some form, tangible and visible, was especially characteristic of the
    mythology of the Nahua nations of Mexico. It is not necessary to go to
    Egypt, or India, or China to find animals of various kinds dedicated
    to and associated with the national gods, for in the Maya and Nahua
    mythologies, as well as in the traditions of some of the wild tribes of
    the Pacific coast, the serpent, the coyote, the beaver and the buzzard
    play an active part. The erection of religious structures representing
    animals no doubt sacred to the Mound-builders, was carried on to a
    remarkable extent in Wisconsin. These strange works probably indicate
    the second step in their scale of architectural progression. In the
    Ohio Valley, while the ordinary mound is found in great numbers, and a
    few instances of animal mounds occur, three new architectural features
    present themselves in marked prominence, all of which are artistically
    in advance of those existing in the North and North-west. These are
    the enclosures, the truncated mounds, and principally the truncated
    pyramids, all of which are a departure from the strict imitation of
    nature, and exhibit the gradual growth of the architectural idea and
    the outcropping of the notion of utility. South of the Ohio Valley
    the animal mounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> disappear altogether and the truncated mounds grow
    less common, while the truncated pyramid, the highest artistic form,
    with its complicated system of graded ways and its nice geometrical
    proportions, becomes the all predominant type of structure. In the
    Lower Mississippi Valley, in some cases, as we have observed, dried
    brick were used in the walls and angles of pyramids of the most
    perfect type. Stone was also employed in a few instances. Here we find
    the transition to Southern Mexico complete. No break exists in the
    architectural chain.</p>

  <p>It does not fall within the scope of this work to treat of the specific
    character and uses of the works of the Mound-builders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> but rather
    to note their extent and indications of age with relation to their
    bearing on the antiquity of man in this country. Some of the arts and
    manufactures of the Mound-builders are set forth in the illustrations
    interspersed throughout the chapter.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> A few of the cuts figure
    objects found upon the surface. Yet it is not improbable that a due
    proportion of these objects were of Mound-builder origin.</p>

  <p>The domestic arts appear the most advanced of any among this ancient
    people. Pottery of respectable quality and of varied patterns is
    abundant among their remains. Coarse cloth woven of vegetable fibre,
    and in some instances partly made of hair, has been discovered in
    mounds in several localities. Shell and copper beads for the purposes
    of ornamentation were made in great numbers. Copper axes of good
    quality have occasionally been exhumed. Copper and bone needles with
    well-drilled eyes were made by them. They wove baskets and coarse
    matting. They carved pipes in stone or moulded them in clay, sometimes
    in fantastic forms, while again they fashioned them with rare skill
    into the perfect effigies of animals and birds, or possibly ornamented
    them with likenesses of their own faces. With <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>the exception of a
    few observations on the altar and sepulchral mounds, we refrain from
    a further treatment of the works above classified, as having no
    particular bearing on the question in hand, and refer the reader to
    the works of Squier and Davis, and also to that of Dr. Foster, already
    often quoted. Of the Altar or Sacrificial Mounds, the first-named
    authors remark: The general characteristics of this class of mounds
    are: 1. That they occur only within the vicinity of the enclosures
    or sacred places; 2. That they are stratified; 3. That they contain
    symmetrical altars of burned clay or stone, on which were deposited
    various remains which in all cases have been more or less subjected to
    the action of fire.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The same authors present the following <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>section
    of a mound examined by them at Mound City, near Chillicothe, Ohio,
    which is a fair sample of the usual stratification observed in altar
    mounds.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The altar which this mound contained was a parallelogram
    measuring 8 × 10 feet at its base and 4 × 6 feet at its top. It was
    only eighteen inches in height, and contained a basin with a dip of
    nine inches. In this basin were found fine ashes, fragments of pottery
    and shell beads. A reference to the figure shows that the sand-stratum
    is semicircular, with its extremities resting on the outer sides of
    the altar. The skeleton shown in the figure designates a point three
    feet below the apex of the mound where two well-preserved skeletons
    were found. The strata were disturbed for their burial evidently at
    a considerable period after the construction of the mound. This is a
    fair example of the “intrusive burial” practised in the mounds by Red
    Indians. The same authors found some of these altars rich in relics;
    one especially in the vicinity of the above-described mound contained
    nearly two hundred pipes carved in stone. Also a considerable number
    of pearl and shell beads and copper ornaments covered with silver. It
    is quite probable that the copper was from their Lake Superior mines,
    as they alone are known to yield deposits of silver with copper. The
    same peculiarity was observed with reference to the copper ornaments
    and implements found in the Marietta works. The pipes secured in this
    mound were much calcined by heat, and considerable copper had been
    fused in the basin of the altar. In some of the mounds examined large
    collections were obtained, and in some instances, articles made of
    obsidian, which it is believed could be procured nowhere nearer than
    the Mexican mountains of Cerro Gordo, or the region west of the Rocky
    Mountains.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

  <p>The evidences are abundant that some mysterious rites were performed
    at the altar mounds; cremation only may have been practised, but we
    fear that even more awful and heart-sickening ceremonies took place
    upon these altars as well as upon the high temple sites in which human
    victims may have been offered to appease the elements or the sun or
    moon by their death agonies. What splendid ceremonial, what mystic
    rites administered by a national priesthood in the presence of a
    devout multitude may have accompanied these horrible sacrifices, are
    beyond even the limits of conjecture. Besides cremation, inhumation
    was also <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>practised extensively. Multitudes of mounds were devoted
    either partly or exclusively to such uses. Mr. Tomlinson, the owner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
    of the Grave Creek Mound, who sank a shaft from its original summit to
    its centre, and intercepted it by a tunnel along the surface of the
    ground, speaking of the latter excavation, remarks: “At the distance
    of one hundred and eleven feet we came to a vault, which had been
    excavated before the mound was commenced, eight by twelve feet and
    seven in depth. Along each side and across the ends, upright timbers
    had been placed, which supported timbers thrown across the vault as a
    ceiling. These timbers were covered with loose unhewn stone, common
    to the neighborhood. The timbers had rotted and tumbled into the
    vault. * * * In this vault were two human skeletons, one of which
    had no ornaments, the other was surrounded by six hundred and fifty
    ivory (shell) beads, and an ivory (bone) ornament six inches long.”
    Thirty-five feet above the bottom vault another was found containing
    a skeleton decorated with copper rings, plates of mica and shell
    disks. The number of disks cut from the shell known as the <i>Buscycon
    perversum</i> and collected by the excavators was 2350; of mica 250
    specimens, and of the little shell known as <i>Marginella apicina</i>,
    500; all of which had been pierced and strung as beads. Ten skeletons
    were subsequently found together upon enlarging the horizontal tunnel.
    Ashes, charcoal and burnt bones were also discovered in large masses.
    Though this was the largest of this class of mounds, still the general
    characteristics of the contents are the same in all of them, and are
    usually disposed in the same relative position to each other.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> One
    of the most interesting explorations of sepulchral mounds was that
    conducted in the autumn of 1865 by Professor O. C. Marsh, assisted by
    Mr. Geo. P. Russell, of Salem, Mass., in what is known as the “Taylor
    Mound,” situated two and a half miles south of Newark, Ohio. The mound
    was ten feet high and eighty feet in diameter, and was surmounted by
    a forest of oak trees ranging from two and a half to eight <span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>feet in
    thickness, while the decaying trunks of a former growth were lying
    upon the ground. The mound was excavated from the apex downward. Five
    feet from the surface a pipe and a tube of stone unknown in Ohio
    were found. Seven feet from the top, in a thin white layer of earth,
    a string of more than one hundred beads of native copper were found
    around the neck of a child about three years old. The salts of the
    copper had preserved the cord of vegetable fibre on which they were
    strung. The beads were about one-fourth of an inch in length and
    one-third in diameter. They evidently had been hammered out of the
    metal in its original state, and the workmanship displayed no inferior
    skill. One foot deeper the remains of two adults, male and female,
    were found carefully buried in layers of bark, their heads towards
    the east, and the body of the female resting upon that of the male
    skeleton. Immediately above these were found a considerable number of
    charred human bones and the evidences of cremation or human sacrifice
    in honor to the couple (probably man and wife) below. The Professor
    even expresses the fear that the wife—who appears to have been about
    thirty years of age—may have been put to death and buried above the
    remains of her deceased consort. A foot deeper the party found another
    layer of charcoal, ashes and charred bones, similar to the above, and
    immediately beneath it a carefully-buried skeleton, much decomposed,
    lying in a white layer of earth, and with its head toward the east.
    A few inches below this skeleton several carelessly-buried skeletons
    were found near the natural level of the earth. Below the natural
    surface a cist six feet long, three feet wide and two feet deep was
    found containing the remains of eight or more skeletons, which seem
    to have been imperfect when buried. The remains had been thrown into
    the grave in a careless and perhaps hasty manner. In the grave were
    found nine lance and arrow-heads of flint. Six small hand-axes, one of
    them of hematite and the others of compact greenstone or diorite, a
    small hatchet of hematite, a flint chisel and scraper, fine needles or
    bodkins made of the metatarsal bones of the common deer, a whistle made
    from the tooth of a young bear, and spoons cut from the shells of river
    mussels. A rude vessel of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> clay was found, but broken, while several
    bones of animals, all but two of existing species in Ohio at present,
    were discovered; though it is worthy of remark that the remains of
    the deer were of a size seldom attained by the species at the present
    day. All the skulls found in the mound were broken, and all but two so
    badly decayed that no effort was made to preserve them. These two were
    of small size showing the vertical occiput, prominent vertex and large
    inter-parietal diameter. There is abundant evidence that the mound had
    never been disturbed by Indians.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

  </div>

  <p>One of the best evidences which we have of the systematic government
    and habits of the Mound-builders, together with the comparatively
    advanced state of the practical arts among them, is found in the
    ancient copper mines of the Lake Superior Region so extensively
    operated by them at quite a remote period.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> These were first
    discovered by Mr. S. O. Knapp, agent of the Minnesota Mining Company,
    in 1848. One excavation explored by this gentleman was thirty feet
    deep, filled with clay and a mass of mouldering vegetable matter.
    Eighteen feet from the surface he found a mass of copper ten feet long,
    three feet wide and two feet thick, weighing over six tons. By digging
    around this great lump of metal, he observed that it was resting on “a
    cob-work of round logs or skids six or eight inches in diameter, the
    ends of which showed plainly the strokes of a small axe or cutting tool
    about two and a half inches in width”. The wood, from its exposure to
    moisture, had lost all its consistency, and opposed no more resistance
    to a knife-blade than would ordinary <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>peat. After having raised the
    mass of copper over five feet along the foot wall of the lode on the
    timbers by means of wedges, the ancient miners had abandoned the task.
    The walls of the mine still show the marks of fire; charcoal and stone
    mauls were taken from this and similar excavations. The largest of
    these mauls weighed thirty-six pounds and was encircled by a double
    groove around its centre. Withes were probably wound in these grooves
    by which two men could wield the maul very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> effectively. The number of
    smaller hammers of greenstone and porphyry removed from these works by
    Mr. Knapp exceeded ten cart-loads. In one of the pits a rude oak ladder
    was found, made by trimming the branches of a tree at a distance from
    the trunk to leave a sufficient foothold. Wooden levers, preserved
    beneath the water, were also of frequent occurrence. A copper maul,
    shaped by pounding in a cold state, and weighing upwards of twenty
    pounds, was found in this locality, as well as many well-formed copper
    implements designed for various purposes. Upon a mound of rubbish near
    one of the excavations, Messrs. Foster and Whitney saw a pine stump ten
    feet in circumference—the trunk having been broken fifteen feet from
    the ground—which must have grown and died after the earth was thrown
    up. Mr. Knapp mentions a hemlock which he found growing on a heap of
    rubbish which had 395 rings of annual growth. Fallen and decayed trees
    of a previous generation were found lying across the pits. In front
    of the Waterbury mine are blocks of stone weighing two and three tons
    which had been removed by the ancient miners from the shaft, and when
    observed by Colonel Whittlesey, they were covered by a forest growth of
    the full size and kind common to the neighboring region. Under a pile
    of rubbish the remains of a trough of cedar bark was brought to light
    and had been used to carry off water baled from the mine by means of
    wooden bowls, some of which were preserved by water in the mines. Mr.
    S. W. Hill communicated to Dr. Foster in 1872 the discovery of mining
    pits in Isle Royal, measuring fifty feet in depth.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In the Ontonagon
    region for thirty miles traces of the ancient miners abound. The idea
    that the Indians formerly worked these mines was abandoned shortly
    after their discovery. They possess no tradition of copper mines, nor
    did their ancestors visited by the Jesuit Fathers in the early part
    of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>the seventeenth century obtain any intelligence of mines, though
    they penetrated this region in 1660. They often mention the occurrence
    of loose masses of copper found in the shape of boulders, but could
    learn nothing from the Indians as to their origin. It is quite certain
    that no traditions were current among them on the subject. “Instead,”
    says Col. Whittlesey, “of viewing copper as an object of every day
    use, they regarded it as a sacred Manitou, and carefully preserved
    pieces of it wrapped up in skin in their lodges for many years; and
    this custom has been continued to modern times.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Father Allouez,
    in his <cite>Relation</cite>, has described this custom.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Father Dablon,
    who shortly afterward visited the Lake Superior tribes, has described
    their superstitions concerning an island where the missionaries first
    met with copper.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> That the Mound-builders were these ancient
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>miners, there is abundant evidence. Col. Whittlesey has described a
    collection of copper implements from Carp River containing pieces of
    native silver, such as have often been found in the Ohio mounds.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> We
    have already referred to this peculiarity of the Lake Superior copper.
    The use of copper by the Mound-builders was very general all the way
    from Wisconsin to the Gulf, and the labor involved in a journey of a
    thousand miles from the Ohio Valley to the copper regions, the toil of
    the summer’s mining, and the tedious transportation of the metal to
    their homes upon their backs, and by means of an imperfect system of
    navigation, indicates either industry and resolution such as no savage
    Indian ever possessed, or a condition of servitude in which thousands
    occupied a position of abject slavery.</p>

  <p>No permanent abodes were erected by the miners in this region, no
    mounds were constructed, but the indications all point to a summer’s
    residence only and a return to the south with the accumulation of
    their toil when the severities of winter approached. Frederick von
    Hellwald expresses it as his opinion that the Mexicans obtained all
    their copper from the Lake Superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> mines, and adds that no evidences
    exist that copper was mined in Mexico or Central America prior to the
    Spanish Conquest.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Humboldt affirms that various metals were mined
    by the Mexicans, but does not specify copper.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Col. Whittlesey and
    Prof. Andrews estimate that in the ancient Lake Superior mines worked
    by the Mound-builders, the removed metal would aggregate a length of
    one hundred and fifty miles in veins of varying thickness. This fact
    certainly indicates that great supplies were transported southward.</p>

  <p>This remarkable people was evidently possessed of the beginnings of
    science; at least if the Davenport and Cincinnati tablets are genuine,
    astronomy must have received considerable attention at their hands. In
    the former tablet we observe a cycle divided into twelve months (which,
    however, is so modern and coincides so strictly with our division as to
    excite suspicion of fraud), while in the latter we have the number 368
    as the sum of the products of the longer and shorter lines, suggestive
    of an approximation to the number of days in a year. Other supposed
    astronomical instruments have been discovered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>in the mounds of
    Ohio, and several of these, <em>antique tubes, telescope devices</em>,
    were discovered in the course of excavations made in 1842 in the most
    easterly of the Elizabethtown group, West Virginia. Mr. Schoolcraft
    makes the following statement concerning them: “Several tubes of stone
    were disclosed, the precise object of which has been the subject of
    various opinions. The longest measured twelve inches, the shortest
    eight. Three of them were carved out of steatite, being skillfully cut
    and polished. The diameter of the tube externally was one inch and
    four-tenths; the bore eight-tenths of an inch. By placing the eye at
    the diminished end, the extraneous light is shut from the pupil, and
    distant objects are more clearly discerned.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> A silver figure found
    in Peru represents a man in the act of studying the heavens through one
    of these tubes, and Captain Dupaix saw a stone in Mexico bearing the
    figure of a man sculptured on its side in the act of using a similar
    tube.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

  <p>With reference to the civilization of the Mound-builders, however
    much writers may differ, we think the following conclusions may be
    safely accepted: That they came into the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>country in comparatively
    small numbers at first (if they were not Autochthones, and there is
    no substantial proof that the Mound-builders were such), and during
    their residence in the territory occupied by the United States they
    became extremely populous. Their settlements were widespread, as the
    extent of their remains indicate. The magnitude of their works, some of
    which approximate the proportions of Egyptian pyramids, testify to the
    architectural talent of the people and the fact that they had developed
    a system of government which controlled the labor of multitudes,
    whether of subjects or slaves. They were an agricultural people, as the
    extensive ancient garden-beds found in Wisconsin and Missouri indicate.
    Their manufactures afford proof that they had attained a respectable
    degree of advancement, and show that they understood the advantages of
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> division of labor.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Their domestic utensils, the cloth of which
    they made their clothing, and the artistic vessels met with everywhere
    in the mounds, point to the development of home culture and domestic
    industry. There is no reason for believing that the people who wrought
    stone and clay into perfect effigies of animals have not left us
    sculptures of their own faces in the images exhumed from the mounds.</p>

    and other purposes.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> They furthermore worked flint and salt mines.

    constructed canals by which lake systems were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>united, a fact which
    Mr. Conant has recently shown to be well established in Missouri.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
    Their defences were numerous and constructed with reference to
    strategic principles, while their system of signals placed on lofty
    summits, visible from their settlements and communicating with the
    great watercourses at immense distances, rival the signal systems in
    use at the beginning of the present century. Their religion seems to
    have been attended with the same ceremonies in all parts of their
    domain. That its rites were celebrated with great demonstrations is
    certain. The sun and moon probably were the all-important deities, to
    whom sacrifices (possibly human) were offered. We have already alluded
    to the development in architecture and art which marked the possible
    transition of this people from north to south. Here we see but the
    rude beginnings of a civilization which no doubt subsequently unfolded
    in its fuller glory in the valley of Anahuac, and spreading southward
    engrafted a new life upon the wreck of Xibalba. Though there is no
    evidence that the Mound-builders were indigenous, we must admit that
    their civilization was purely such—the natural product of climate and
    the conditions surrounding them.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

    Great Antiquity in America.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AT the opening of the preceding chapter we made some allusions to
    the supposed antiquity of the Red Indian, a subject of growing
    archæological significance, though as yet it affords us rather
    unsatisfactory evidence, scientifically considered, relative to the
    problem of man’s antiquity on this continent. Quite different, however,
    is the estimate which we place on data left us by the people of the
    mounds. The question of the antiquity of the Mound-builders is one
    which cannot be accurately determined; no chronometric scale can be
    applied to the uncertain record which they have left behind them.
    Their history is a sealed book, and the approximate date of their
    first occupancy of the Mississippi Basin is as uncertain as the period
    of man’s origin. However, certain data present themselves for our
    consideration which lead us to conclude that a few thousand years,
    three or four perhaps, and possibly even less time, is all that is
    required in which to account for their growth into a nation and the
    moderate advancement which they made toward civilization. As to when
    the Mound-builders left this country, is another question, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> can be
    approximated more closely. It is a well-known fact that no tradition
    was ever found among the Indians as to the origin or the purpose for
    which the mounds were constructed. They described them as having been
    found by their ancestors in the same condition in which we now see
    them, and clothed, if not with the same, at least with a growth of
    vegetation similar to that which covers them to-day. It is true the
    Iroquois, who are supposed to have reached the lake regions and the
    Ohio Valley some time previous to the Algonquins, had certain vague
    traditions of a people whom they called the “Allighewi;” but there
    seems to be nothing in those indefinite allusions which would associate
    that unknown people with the mounds. Still, Indian tradition is nearly
    valueless in determining this question, since any fact, however grave,
    was soon forgotten by a people so savage and unsettled. The tribes
    of the lake region, says Dr. Lapham in his <cite>Antiquities</cite>, so
    soon forgot the visit of the Jesuit Fathers that their descendants
    a few generations later had no tradition of the event. The same is
    true of the Indians of the Mississippi Valley with reference to De
    Soto’s expedition, “which must,” remarks Dr. Foster, “have impressed
    their ancestors with dread at the sight of horses ridden by men, and
    the sound of fire-arms, which they must have likened to thunder. Sir
    John Lubbock states that the New Zealanders at the time of Captain
    Cook’s visit had forgotten altogether Tasman’s visit, made less than
    one hundred and thirty years before.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Another <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>argument for the
    construction of the mounds at a remote period, and which is certainly
    of little more value than Indian tradition, is that which supposes
    the Mound-builders to have erected works on the lowest of the river
    terraces existing at the time of their occupancy of the country.
    Much stress has been laid on the fact that no works have been found
    on the lowest-formed of the river terraces which mark the subsidence
    of the western rivers. “And as there is no good reason,” remarks Mr.
    Baldwin, “why their builders should have avoided erecting them on
    that terrace while they raised them promiscuously on all the others,
    it follows, not unreasonably, that this terrace has been formed since
    the works were erected.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> To any one familiar with the great rise
    and fall which takes place annually in the water-level of the Ohio
    and Mississippi and all of their tributaries, the fallacy of such
    an argument is at once apparent. We must at least allow that the
    Mound-builders learned by experience, just as animals do, even if we
    could deny them a very high order of intelligence. Little time could
    have elapsed after their advent to these valleys before they observed
    the impracticability of erecting mounds or enclosures on most of the
    alluvial bottoms bordering these streams. The raging torrents which
    sometimes sweep through the valleys of the central basin, uprooting
    the largest trees, carrying away natural embankments, forming immense
    deposits of new alluvium, submerging miles of adjacent country, and
    in many ways changing its physical conformation, would in a few years
    obliterate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> any traces of earthworks built within their reach.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Far
    more certain data, however, is furnished in the arborescent vegetation
    which covers many of the works, with which to measure part of the
    period during which they have remained unoccupied, though we are left
    in uncertainty as to the remoteness of their abandonment. The annular
    rings of a tree present us indisputable evidence as to its age.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> It
    is evident that the forests which cover these remains have grown up
    since they were vacated, as no difference exists between them and the
    surrounding vegetation—no break exists in the density of the forests
    in the immediate vicinity of the works. The oldest of the trees found
    upon the works present eight hundred annual rings, indicating as many
    years of growth.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> This cannot, however, be set down as the limit of
    the period of their abandonment, since, as it seems that this country
    was open and mostly unwooded in the sections thickly settled by the
    Mound-builders, a considerable time would be requisite for the slow
    encroachments of a forest, even when the trees which now stand upon
    the mounds may have been preceded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> by trees of other species or by
    two or three generations of their own.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The age of the trees on
    the mound-works in the Ohio Valley or farther north, rarely exceeds
    five hundred or six hundred years, and such cases as that cited by Sir
    Charles Lyell are the exceptions. Farther south, in the Mississippi
    Valley and near the Gulf, they are still younger than those at the
    north.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> So noticeable is this that we are led to think the Gulf
    coast may have been occupied by the Mound-builders for a couple of
    centuries after they were driven by their enemies from the country
    north of the mouths of the Missouri and Ohio Rivers. The condition of
    skeletons found in the mounds indicate an antiquity which they furnish
    us no means of measuring. It is not to be presumed that all human
    remains discovered in excavating the works were interred immediately
    previous to the abandonment of the country. Some of them may belong
    to the middle or beginning of the period of their residence in the
    territory occupied by the United States. Human remains taken from the
    mounds, perhaps furnish us better evidence of the long residence of the
    Mound-builders in this country than any other data in our possession.
    It suffices to say that few Mound-builder crania have been recovered in
    a condition to be of any service to science; although of late years,
    several valuable collections <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>have been made. The preservation of the
    skeletons depends greatly on the composition of the soil in which they
    are found. The Loess has afforded well-preserved remains, however,
    with the gelatinous matter leached out. The crania of the sandy loam
    of river bottoms, on the other hand, are in all cases so far decayed
    upon discovery that the greatest precautions fail to prevent them from
    crumbling to dust when exposed to the light and air. Mastodon bones,
    on the contrary, recovered from peat swamps, and much older than any
    of the remains of the Mound-builders, are found to have retained so
    much of their gelatinous matter as to furnish a nourishing soup.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
    To these evidences may be added the testimony derived from the ancient
    ruins which points to long-continued occupation and to a considerable
    lapse of time since their abandonment.</p>

  <p>How long the Mound-builders occupied the country north of the Gulf of
    Mexico it is impossible in the present state of science to determine.
    Some authors conjecture that they were here two thousand years; that
    we think would be time enough, though after all it is but conjecture.
    It seems to us, however, that the time of the abandonment of their
    works may be more closely approximated. A thousand or two years may
    have elapsed since they vacated the Ohio Valley, and a period embracing
    seven or eight centuries may have passed since they retired from the
    Gulf coast. As an evidence of a large population having existed in this
    country at a former period, we have immense shell-heaps artificially
    collected, extending along the Atlantic coast from Nova Scotia to
    Florida, on the Gulf coast and up the river valleys through nearly
    all of the Southern States. It is difficult to assign the formation
    of these vast remains to any definite period or to any particular
    people. Though of the same character as the <i lang="da">Kjökken-Möddings</i>
    (Kitchen-Middens) of the Danish, they furnish no indications of so
    great an antiquity. This has been shown by Dr. Jeffries Wyman in his
    researches in Maine and Massachusetts.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Sir Charles Lyell made an
    examination of a shell-bank on St. Simon’s Island, near the mouth of
    the Allamaha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> River, Georgia, so extensive that it covers ten acres to
    a depth varying from five to ten feet.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Dr. Brinton has described
    immense accumulations in Florida. On Amelia Island, shells exist to
    the depth of three feet over an area 150 yards wide and a quarter of a
    mile long. Notable instances of a similar kind are Turtle Mound near
    Smyrna—a mass of oyster shells thirty feet thick—and a shell-bank
    on Crystal River four miles from its mouth, reaching a height of
    forty feet.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Dr. Wyman carefully examined many of the fresh-water
    shell-heaps of Florida and obtained pretty satisfactory results.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
    Near the Silver spring upon a shell-heap covering nearly twenty acres,
    stand several live-oaks of immense size, the largest of which measured
    between twenty-six and twenty-seven feet in circumference. Excavations
    under this monster, taken together with its position on the side of
    the shell-bank, proved it to be of more recent origin than the latter.
    Prof. Wyman, by allowing twelve rings to the inch and granting it a
    semi-diameter of fifty inches, estimated that it was not less than
    six hundred years old. Of course the shell-bank may have existed a
    long time before any vegetation appeared upon it. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>crania of
    the shell-banks of Florida differ from those of the Mound-builders
    in greater thickness as well as greater mean capacity.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> In his
    <cite>Fresh-water Shell-Mounds of the St. John’s River</cite>, and in his
    memoir on <cite>Human Remains in the Shell-heaps of the St. John’s
    River</cite> (<cite>Seventh Annual Report of Peabody Museum</cite>, pp. 26
    <i>et seq.</i>), Dr. Wyman reports having discovered the startling
    fact that cannibalism prevailed among the barbarous people of the
    shell-banks. In the Peabody Museum a collection of human bones taken
    from the shell-banks by Dr. Wyman are arranged to illustrate this sad
    discovery. It is possible that this people had some relationship to
    the Caribs. Prof. Forshey has described in brief the vast extent and
    proportions of the marine shell-banks of the Gulf coast, and the shores
    of the bayous, lakes and lagoons where Guathodon shells are found.
    Those of Louisiana, especially near New Orleans, are remarkable, but
    have yielded no remains, except broken pottery, flint flakes and stone
    hatchets. A shell-bank at Grand Lake, on the Teche, however, upon which
    great live-oaks are growing, situated fifteen miles inland, from which
    the sea has receded since its formation, “yielded unique specimens of
    axes of hæmatitic iron-ore and glazed pottery.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Probably the most
    remote shell-bank from the sea containing marine shells, occurs on the
    Alabama River, fifty miles inland.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Fresh-water shell-banks, other
    than those examined in Florida, furnish evidences of slow accumulation
    and indicate a comparatively remote antiquity for their origin. On
    Stalling’s Island, in the Savannah River, two hundred miles above its
    mouth, is a shell-bank three hundred feet in length by one hundred
    and twenty feet in width, with an average depth of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>over fifteen
    feet.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> In the American Bottom and on many of the tributaries of
    the Mississippi, shell-banks occur, composed of varieties of the
    Unios and Anodons. A remarkable example of such accumulation is the
    well-known shell-bank a mile and a half south of New Harmony, Indiana,
    and situated on a high hill 170 feet above the level of an arm of the
    Wabash River. The bank covers an area of a quarter of an acre, and
    has attracted the attention of eminent scientists like Leasure, Say,
    Lyell and others, but nothing of value was developed that would refer
    the construction of this and similar banks to any people more ancient
    than the Mound-builders.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> On the Pacific coast, great numbers of
    shell-banks exist, but contain nothing different from those in other
    parts of the country. (See Researches in the Kjökken Möddings of the
    Coast of Oregon and of the Santa Barbara Islands and Adjacent Mainland,
    by Paul Schumacher. <cite>Bulletin of U. S. Geol. and Geog. Survey</cite>,
    vol. iii, No. 1.) There can be little doubt but these strange and vast
    accumulations indicating the presence of an extinct population, had a
    remote beginning, and have been added to from time to time by different
    peoples, removed from each other both by the diversities of race and
    the lapse of time.</p>

  <p>A trifle more than a decade ago the treatment of the subject of this
    chapter would have called for a discussion of the antiquity of the
    magnificent architectural remains of Southern Mexico, and of the still
    older ruins of the Maya civilization in Yucatan, and the branches of
    that people in Central America; but the indefatigable labor which has
    been bestowed by several eminent antiquarians upon the ancient history
    of the civilized nations of the New World previous to its discovery by
    Europeans, has transferred this part of the subject to another field;
    has elevated it from the uncertain position it occupied in archæology
    to a place in the realm of history. It is true that it is difficult
    to draw the line between tradition and history, and especially so in
    this case; but as tradition does not conflict with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>archæology in its
    bearing on the ancient civilization of Tropical America, it is better
    than nothing; certainly archæology thus far has amounted to little
    more than nothing in revealing the approximate period of the origin of
    these remains. While it has done much towards verifying tradition and
    assisted largely in its interpretation, it has not been adequate to the
    task of solving the age of these remains. Tradition, on the contrary,
    and we might almost say history, carries us back three thousand years,
    if not farther, as the period when man—whether the first here or
    not—appeared upon the Western Continent. The discussion of this part of
    our subject will be given in a future chapter. Too much doubt exists
    with reference to the stupendous remains of Peru, especially in the
    neighborhood of Lake Titicaca, Tiahuanaco, Old Huanaco, and Grau-Chimu,
    as to whether they antedated the arrival of the Incas by a great lapse
    of time, to admit of a serious discussion here. Nothing of a scientific
    character is available as yet upon which even to base conjecture.
    Rivero and Tschudi, it is true, have treated the subject, and their
    work has been often quoted, but after all it amounts to but little
    more than a description of the remains, which serves the good end of
    exciting interest in the subject. The antiquities and legendary history
    of the Peruvians have so recently been treated with such ability by Mr.
    E. G. Squier, that the South American civilization needs no attention
    in this connection.</p>

  <p>In considering the question as to how long man has inhabited this
    continent, his influence upon nature cannot be overlooked. In the
    animal kingdom, certain animals were domesticated by the aborigines
    from so remote a period that scarcely any of their species, as in the
    case of the lama of Peru, were to be found in a state of unrestrained
    freedom at the advent of the Spaniards. In the vegetable kingdom more
    abundant testimony of the same nature is presented. A plant must be
    subjected to the transforming influences of cultivation for a long
    time before it becomes so changed as no longer to be identified with
    the wild species, and infinitely longer before it becomes entirely
    dependent upon cultivation for propagation. Yet we find that both
    of these facts have been accomplished with reference to the maize,
    tobacco,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> cotton, quinoa and mandico plants; and the only species
    of palm cultivated by the South American Indians, that known as the
    <i>Gulielma speciosa</i>, has lost through that culture its original
    nut-like seed, and is dependent upon the hands of its cultivators
    for its life.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Alluding to the above-named plants, Dr. Brinton
    remarks: “Several are sure to perish unless fostered by human care.
    What numberless ages does this suggest? How many centuries elapsed ere
    man thought of cultivating Indian corn? How many more ere it had spread
    over nearly a hundred degrees of latitude and lost all resemblance
    to its original form?”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Certainly this class of evidence, though
    furnishing no chronometric scale, points us to an antiquity for man on
    this continent more venerable than that suggested either by tumuli or
    architectural remains. The peculiar value of this argument rests in the
    fact that with the exception of cotton, none of the plants indicated
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>have ever been cultivated by any other people than the aborigines of
    America, and could not have matured their characteristics of dependence
    in the old world, and been brought hither through the channel of
    immigration.</p>

  <p>Back of the age of man’s monuments of an architectural character,
    beyond the beginning of the first existing shell-heap, and at a time
    probably more remote than the first cultivation of maize, it has been
    supposed that man occupied the Western Continent as a contemporary with
    the mastodon, megalonyx and other extinct animals. Our information
    in this department is entirely dependent upon the revelations of
    geological science. Unfortunately very little data which may be termed
    truly scientific has been brought to light. While considerable seeming
    testimony to man’s antiquity on this continent has been produced
    from a geologic quarter, still it mostly has been of an unscientific
    character. Fossils and human remains are said to have been discovered
    in localities and in associations that if the statements of those who
    found them could be relied on, would give man an antiquity here as
    great as in the valley of the Somme or in the bone caves of Belgium,
    France, and England. In the instances alluded to, it is not so often
    feared that the veracity of discoverers is doubtful as that their
    general lack of acquaintance with the science should make them liable
    to error. Where a competent geologist is not present to examine a
    fossil <i>in situ</i>, and report intelligently upon its position and
    surroundings, the case must remain open to suspicion. Unfortunately
    for science, this is precisely the weak point in most of the reputed
    “finds” which are cited as evidence in this field. In 1848, Count
    Pourtales found in Florida, according to Agassiz, a human jaw and
    teeth, and bones of the foot, embedded in a calcareous conglomerate
    forming a part of a coral reef. This reef, according to Agassiz, may
    be 135,000 years old, and the human remains at least ten thousand
    years.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> This statement has been accepted as reliable by Sir Charles
    Lyell,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Daniel Wilson,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and other noted scientific gentlemen.
    Count Pourtales, however, makes a statement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> which materially alters
    the case. He says: “The human jaws and other bones found by myself in
    Florida in 1848, were not in a coral formation, but in a fresh-water
    sandstone on the shore of Lake Monroe, associated with fresh-water
    shells or species still living in the lakes (Paulina, Ampullaria,
    etc.). No date can be assigned to the formation of that deposit, at
    least from present observation.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Human remains were found a number
    of years ago embedded in the solid rock in the island of Guadaloupe.
    “But more careful investigation proved the rock to be a concretionary
    limestone formed from the detritus of corals and shells.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> This
    rock was ascertained to have been one of very rapid formation.</p>

  <p>Sir Charles Lyell, in his <cite>Travels in America</cite> in 1842, expressed
    the opinion that certain human remains found embedded in the solid rock
    near the town of St. Paul on the Santos River, Brazil, were of great
    antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Subsequently referring to the memoir of Dr. Meigs on
    the shell-heap of which the rock was a part,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> he expresses the
    opinion that shells were brought to the place and heaped up over the
    remains, and “were bound together in a solid stone by the infiltration
    of carbonate of lime, and the mound may therefore be of no higher
    antiquity than those above alluded to on the Ohio.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In a few
    instances it has been alleged that the remains of man have been found
    associated with the remains of the mastodon and other extinct animals.
    More than thirty years ago Dr. Dickson of Natchez discovered the pelvic
    bone of a man, the <i lang="la">os innominatum</i>, mingled with the bones of
    extinct animals (megalonyx and mylodon). This discovery was made two
    and one-half miles from Natchez, at the bottom of what is known as
    Bernard’s Bayou, an immense ravine from thirty to sixty feet deep and
    several miles long, formed by the convulsions of the earthquake of
    1811–12. This bone is now in the possession of the Academy of Natural
    Sciences of Philadelphia. Sir Charles Lyell visited the spot where it
    was discovered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>in 1846, and made a careful examination of the bone
    then in the possession of Dr. Dickson, and also explored the “Mammoth
    Ravine.” He discusses the case as follows: “It appeared to be quite
    in the same state of preservation and was of the same black color as
    the other fossils, and was believed to have come like them from a
    depth of about thirty feet from the surface. In my <cite>Second Visit
    to America</cite> in 1846,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> I suggested as a possible explanation
    of this association of a human bone with remains of a mastodon and
    megalonyx, that the former may possibly have been derived from the
    vegetable soil at the top of the cliff, where, as the remains of
    extinct mammalia were dislodged from a lower position, and both may
    have fallen into the same heap or talus at the bottom of the ravine,
    the pelvic bone might, I conceived, have acquired its black color
    from having lain for years or centuries in a dark superficial peaty
    soil common in that region. I was informed that there were many human
    bones in old Indian graves in the same district stained of as black
    a dye.” * * * “No doubt, had the pelvic bone belonged to any recent
    mammifier other than man, such a theory would never have been resorted
    to; but so long as we have only one isolated case, and are without
    the testimony of a geologist who was present to behold the bone when
    still engaged in the matrix, and to extract it with his own hands, it
    is allowable to suspend our judgment as to the high antiquity of the
    fossil”.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Both Dr. Joseph Leidy<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and Prof. C. G. Forshey,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
    who have examined the case, agree with the above. A few years ago a
    fragment of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>matting composed of the outer bark of the southern cane
    (<i>Arundinaria macrosperma</i>) was discovered on Petit Anse Island
    in Vermillion Bay, Louisiana, in connection with the remains of a
    fossil elephant. This island, containing about five thousand acres,
    is the locality of an extraordinary mine of rock salt, discovered and
    worked considerably during the late rebellion. The salt is found in
    nearly all parts of the island at the depth of fifteen or twenty feet
    below the surface of the soil. The matting was discovered near the
    surface of the salt, and about two feet above it were the remains of an
    elephant, including the tusks. Prof. Henry was the first to call public
    attention to the matter in a notice based on the verbal statements
    of T. F. Cleu, Esq., who presented a specimen of the matting to the
    Smithsonian Institution.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In 1867, Prof. E. W. Hilgard and Dr. E.
    Fontaine, secretary of the New Orleans Academy of Sciences, examined
    the locality. We regret to say that the report made by the latter is
    so confused in its use of terms and so conflicting in its statements
    as to be of no service to science.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Prof. Hilgard is, on the
    contrary, clear on the subject. He considers the heap in which the
    matting, elephant bones, and subsequently pottery in great profusion,
    were found, “A mass of detritus washed down from the surrounding
    hills.” “The pottery,” he remarks, “at some points form veritable
    strata three and six inches thick.” He then adds in a note that “it
    is very positively stated that mastodon bones were found considerably
    <em>above</em> some of the human relics. In a detrital mass, however,
    this cannot be considered a crucial test.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Dr. Foster, after
    citing the above, interposes the objection, “That in an island whose
    area is less than eight miles square, there would be few floods of
    sufficient power to transport such heavy bones as the tusks and molars
    of mastodons to any considerable distance.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Certainly the question
    is an open one, and in its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>present unsettled status proves nothing.
    The same uncertainty attaches itself to the discoveries of Dr. Lund,
    the distinguished Swedish naturalist, made many years ago in the bone
    caves of Minas Geraes, Brazil. This indefatigable investigator examined
    more than eight hundred caverns, and in only six were human remains
    found. In one instance out of the six, the remains were associated
    with the bones of animals now extinct, but the original stratification
    had been disturbed, and the presumption is that it was a case of
    comparatively recent interment.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

  <p>The most remarkable instance of the supposed, or we might be allowed
    in this case to say <em>pretended</em> discovery of human remains in
    association with those of extinct animals, is that set forth by Dr.
    Koch. This collector of curiosities described his discovery of a
    <i>mastodon giganteus</i> in 1839 in Gasconade County, Missouri,
    at a spot on the Bourbeuse River, first in a newspaper article of
    January 1839, and cited in the <cite>American Journal of Science and
    Arts</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> And a second time in the St. Louis <cite>Commercial
    Bulletin</cite> of June 25, 1839, which article was also noticed in the
    above Journal.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> This article was signed “A. Koch, Proprietor of the
    St. Louis Museum.” Subsequently he published descriptions in pamphlets,
    which unfortunately did not always convey the same impressions.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
    Dr. Koch, after referring to the discovery of a back and hip bone
    of this remarkable animal, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>gives the following description: “I
    immediately commenced opening a much larger space; the first layer
    of earth was a vegetable mould, then a blue clay, then sand and blue
    clay. I found a large quantity of pieces of rocks, weighing from two
    to twenty-five pounds each, evidently thrown there with the intention
    of hitting some object. It is necessary to remark that not the least
    sign of rocks or gravel is to be found nearer than from four or five
    hundred yards, and that these pieces were broken from larger rocks,
    and consequently carried here for some express purpose. After passing
    through these rocks I came to a layer of vegetable mould; on the
    surface of this was found the first blue bone, with this a spear and
    axe; the spear corresponds precisely with our common Indian spear; the
    axe is different from any I have seen. Also on this earth were ashes
    nearly from six inches to one foot in depth, intermixed with burned
    wood and burned bones, broken spears, axes, knives, etc. The fire
    appeared to have been the largest on the head and neck of the animal,
    as the ashes and coals were much deeper here than in the rest of the
    body; the skull was quite perfect, but so much burned that it crumbled
    to dust on the least touch; two feet from this was found two teeth
    broken off from the jaw, but mashed entirely to pieces. By putting them
    together, they showed the animal to have been much larger than any
    heretofore discovered. It appeared by the situation of the skeleton,
    that the animal had been sunk with its hind feet in the mud and water,
    and, unable to extricate itself, had fallen on its right side, and in
    that situation was found and killed as above described; consequently
    the hind and fore-feet on the right side were sunk deeper in the mud,
    and thereby saved from the effects of the fire; therefore I was able
    to preserve the whole of the hind foot to the very last joint, and the
    fore foot, all but some few small bones that were too much decayed
    to be worth saving. Also between the rocks that had sunk through the
    ashes, were found large pieces of skin that appeared like fresh-tanned
    sole leather, strongly impregnated with the lye from the ashes; and
    a great many of the sinews and arteries were plain to be seen on the
    earth and rocks, but in such a state as not to be moved except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> in
    small pieces the size of a hand, which are now preserved in spirits.”
    “Should any doubts arise in the mind of the reader of the correctness
    of the above statement, he can be referred to more than twenty
    witnesses who were present at the time of digging.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Subsequent
    accounts agree substantially with the above except that we never again
    hear of the “large pieces of skin,” the “sinews and arteries,” “which
    are now preserved in spirits.” The presumption is that the author, upon
    mature reflection, arrived at the conclusion that in reality he had
    seen nothing of the kind, and in fact had never preserved such relics
    in spirits.</p>

  <p>Dr. Koch made a second discovery about one year subsequently in Benton
    County, Missouri, in the bottom of the Pomme-de-Terre River, at about
    ten miles above its junction with the Osage River. His description is
    as follows: “The second trace of human existence with these animals
    I found during the excavation of the Missourium. There was embedded
    immediately under the femur or hind-leg bone of this animal, an
    arrow-head of rose-colored flint, resembling those used by the American
    Indians, but of larger size. This was the only arrow-head immediately
    with the skeleton; but in the same strata, at a distance of five or
    six feet, in a horizontal direction, four more arrow-heads were found.
    Three of these were of the same formation as the preceding. The fourth
    was of very rude workmanship. One of the last-mentioned three was of
    agate, the others of blue flint. These arrow-heads are indisputably
    the work of human hands. I examined the deposit in which they were
    embedded, and raised them out of their embedment with my own hands.
    The original stratum on which this river flowed at the time it was
    inhabited by the <i>Missourium theristocaulodon</i> and up to the
    time of its destruction, was of the upper green sand. On the surface
    of this stratum, and partly mingled with it, was the deposit of the
    before-described skeleton. The next stratum is from three to four feet
    in thickness, and consisted of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>a brown alluvium of the <em>Eocene</em>
    region, and was composed of vegetable matters of a tropical production.
    It contained all the remainder of the skeleton.” “Most of these
    vegetables were in a great state of preservation and consisted of a
    large quantity of cypress burs, wood and bark, tropical cane, ferns,
    palmetto leaves, several stumps of trees, and even the greater part of
    a flower of the strelitzia class, which when destroyed was not full
    blown. There was no sign or indication of any very large trees; the
    cypresses that were discovered being the largest that were growing here
    at the time. These various matters had been torn up by their roots
    and twisted and split into a thousand pieces apparently by lightning
    combined with a tremendous tempest or tornado; and all were involved
    in one common ruin. Several veins of iron pyrites ran through the
    stratum.” “The next over this formation was a layer of plastic clay of
    the <em>Eocene</em> region, also with iron pyrites. It was three feet
    in thickness; over this a layer of conglomerate from nine to eighteen
    inches in thickness; over this a layer of marl of the Pliocene region,
    from three to four feet in thickness; next, a second conglomerate from
    nine to eighteen inches in thickness. This was succeeded by a layer of
    yellow clay of the Pliocene; over this a third layer of conglomerate
    from nine to eighteen inches in thickness, and at last the present
    surface, consisting of brownish clay mingled with a few pebbles, and
    covered with large oak, maple, and elm trees, which were, as near as I
    could ascertain, from eighty to one hundred years old. In the centre
    of the above-mentioned deposit was a large spring which appeared to
    rise from the very bowels of the earth, as it was never affected by the
    severest rain, nor did it become lower by the longest draught.”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
    The preceding accounts were presented to the St. Louis Academy of
    Sciences in a special paper several years later (1857).<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

  <p>Dr. Foster is inclined to believe that Dr. Koch was not mistaken
    in his claimed discovery, having arrived at that opinion by
    pointedly questioning him on the subject a short time before <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>his
    (Koch’s) death.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Charles Rau is also of the opinion that he was
    truthful.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Mr. J. D. Dana, however, discusses the case as follows:
    “In the account of the second case above cited Dr. Koch says that
    the Missourium was embedded in a brown alluvium of the Eocene region
    resting on the ‘upper green sand;’ that next over it was plastic
    clay of the ‘Eocene region’ and beds of the ‘Pliocene region.’ He
    thus makes his Missourium to have come from the lower tertiary, and
    from a bed just above the green sand (cretaceous) when actually from
    quartenary beds; and he uses the terms Eocene and Pliocene, as if he
    had no familiarity with geological facts or language. The earlier
    pamphlet of 1840 avoids this bad geology, ‘the upper green sand,’ in
    that being called simply quicksand and the other beds merely beds of
    clay and conglomerate. All the pamphlets sustain the conclusion that
    Dr. Koch knew almost nothing of geology, and that what he gradually
    picked up from intercourse with geologists, he generally made much
    of but seldom was able to use rightly.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The same critic says:
    “In zoological knowledge he was equally deficient,” and cites the
    fact of the discoverer recognizing the resemblance to the mastodon,
    still makes the animal an inhabitant of the watercourses like the
    hippopotamus; states that his food “consisted as much of vegetables as
    of flesh, although he undoubtedly consumed a great abundance of the
    latter,” and makes the marvelous revelation that he “<em>was capable
    of feeding himself with his fore-foot after the manner of the beaver
    or otter</em>.” Mr. Dana continues: “He says that one arrow-head lay
    ‘immediately under the femur or thigh-bone,’ and he further states in
    his later article of 1857, that ‘he carefully thought to investigate
    the point as to its having been brought thither after the deposit of
    the bone’ and decided against it. The observation and conclusion would
    have been more satisfactory had the author been a better observer.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
    “The descriptions of the deposits in Gasconade County containing the
    remains of an animal the principal part of which was consumed by
    fire is a still more unsatisfactory basis for a safe conclusion as
    to age. But in the article of 1857, he says that the layer of ashes,
    etc., ‘was covered by strata or alluvial deposits consisting of clay,
    sand and soil, from eight to nine feet thick, <em>forming the bottom
    of the Bourbeuse (River) in general</em>,’ which seems to make it
    almost certain that the beds were of quite recent origin.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Mr.
    Dana considers Dr. Koch’s evidence as “<em>very doubtful</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
    Dr. Foster has figured a fossil which, for a better name, he has
    designated as a “stone hatchet,” from the modified drift of Jersey
    County, Illinois.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> He is positive as to the position in which it
    was found, but has doubt as to its human origin. The probabilities are
    that its peculiar shape is due to its exposure to atmospheric agents.
    He remarks, however: “On the whole, I will not positively assert that
    this specimen is of human workmanship, but I affirm that if it had
    been recovered from a plowed field I should have unhesitatingly said
    it was an Indian hatchet.” In the <cite>Proceedings of the Philadelphia
    Academy of Sciences</cite> for July, 1859, Dr. Holmes describes the
    occurrence of fragments of pottery in close proximity with the bones of
    the mastodon and megatherium, on the Ashley River in South Carolina.
    The case, however, has not been considered authentic by scientific
    men. Dr. Holmes is possibly mistaken.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Col. Charles Whittlesey,
    in 1838, saw at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>Portsmouth, Ohio, on the Ohio River, remains of
    ancient fire-places situated eighteen to twenty feet above low water
    and about fifteen feet below the surface. He states, “at low water and
    thence up to a height of twelve or fifteen feet is a bed of sand and
    transported gravel, containing pebbles of quartz, granite, sandstone
    and limestone, derived partly from the adjacent Carboniferous and
    Devonian rocks and partly from the northern drift, the upper part
    much the coarsest. On this is a layer of blue quicksand from one to
    five feet thick, in which is a timber-bed including large numbers of
    the trunks, branches, stumps and leaves of trees, such as are now
    growing on the Ohio, principally birch, black-ash, oak and hickory.
    Over the dirt-bed is the usually loamy yellow clay of the valley,
    fifteen to thirty feet thick, on which are very extensive works of the
    Mound-builders. In and near the bottom of this undisturbed homogeneous
    river-loam I saw two places where fire had been built on a circular
    collection of small stones, a part of which were then embedded in the
    bank.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Near these fire-places the writer of the above found the
    membranous covering of common river shells (the Unios). We think that
    no geologist familiar with the constant changes of the Ohio River bed,
    will consider that the conditions surrounding these ancient fire-places
    warrant us in assigning them a much greater antiquity than we attach
    to the Mound-builders’ works in the neighborhood. In 1846, Sir Charles
    Lyell, when at New Orleans, made an estimate of the time required to
    account for the immense annual deposit of the Mississippi River in the
    neighborhood of its delta. From a computation based on certain data,
    which assumed the area of the alluvial plain which is the result of
    those deposits, to equal 30,000 square miles, several hundred feet
    thick in some places, he estimated that probably 100,000 years would
    be requisite.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Subsequently, during the process of excavating for
    the New Orleans Gas Works, it was found necessary to cut through four
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>buried cypress forests. At the depth of sixteen feet and on the fourth
    forest level, a human skeleton distinctly of the Indian type,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> was
    found under the roots of a cypress tree, together with burnt wood. Dr.
    Dowler, dividing the history of the delta into, 1. The epoch of grasses
    or aquatic plants; 2. That of the cypress (<i>Taxodium distichum</i>)
    basins, and 3. That of the live-oak platform, tabulates the age of the
    strata overlying the skeleton as follows:</p>

  <p>The basis for his estimate of the age of the cypress basins was the
    computed age of the trees of the fourth level, ten feet in diameter and
    probably reaching 5,700 years.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Sir Charles Lyell in a later work,
    though still adhering to his former estimate of the time required in
    which to form the delta, cannot accept Dr. Dowler’s great antiquity
    for the remains.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The question in hand of course involves the
    question of the antiquity of the deposit where the skeleton was found,
    which is well-nigh identical with the vexed question of the age of
    the delta. The very diversity of opinion on this subject precludes
    the possibility of its consideration here. We will content ourselves
    by citing two estimates in addition to those already given. Professor
    Edward Hitchcock calculated that the entire delta embraced a bulk of
    matter equal to 2,720 <em>cubic</em> miles, for the deposit of which he
    thought 14,204 years necessary.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Humphries and Abbot think that
    both the area and thickness of the deposit have been overstated, and
    instead of 30,000 square miles for the former, they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>claim only 19,450.
    As to the latter, they estimate the thickness of the alluvial matter as
    but twenty-five feet on the river banks along the St. Francis swamp;
    thirty-five along the Yazoo swamp, and continuing of uniform thickness
    to Baton Rouge; while the artesian well at New Orleans showed it in
    that locality to reach a point forty feet below the level of the Gulf.
    These authors base their calculations as to the age of the deposits on
    the following ascertained facts: the total yearly contributions of the
    river equal a prism two hundred and sixty-eight feet in height, with a
    base of one mile square; two hundred and sixty-two feet is the supposed
    mean yearly advance of the river; the original mouth of the Mississippi
    was near the afflux of the Bayou Plaquemine, and has hence progressed
    two hundred and twenty miles since it began to empty its deposits into
    the Gulf. Supposing these data to be correct, they estimate that only
    four thousand four hundred years have elapsed since that period.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
    This would give the skeleton alluded to a comparatively recent origin.
    We are inclined to believe that the above estimate assigns a period for
    the formation of the delta as much too short as that of Sir Charles was
    too long. As to the antiquity of the skeleton, probably Dr. Foster’s
    solution of the question is as near correct as any that ever may be
    proposed: “Thus, then, with these carefully-observed computations
    before us, we are not prepared to accept the high antiquity assigned
    by Dr. Dowler to the human remains found beneath the surface at New
    Orleans. What he regards as four buried forests which once flourished
    on the spot, may be nothing more than driftwood brought down the river
    in former times which became embedded in the silts and sediments which
    were deposited on what was then the floor of the Gulf.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

  <p>If all the indications were verified, we should be justified in
    assigning man a much greater antiquity in the Rocky Mountain region
    and on the Pacific slope than in any other part of North America.
    Mr. E. L. Berthoud collected numerous stone implements in what he
    considers to be tertiary gravel on Crow Creek and in the region of the
    South Platte River, Lat. 40 N., Long. 104 W. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>Two shells secured in
    the same locality by him have been pronounced a <i>corbicula</i> and
    a <i>rangia</i> respectively, and are thought to belong to the older
    Pliocene or possibly to the Miocene.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The evidence in this case is,
    however, unsatisfactory, and cannot be admitted to be of scientific
    value without further authentication.</p>

  <p>In 1857 a portion of a human cranium was found associated with bones
    of the mastodon at the depth of one hundred and eighty feet below the
    surface in a mining shaft at Table Mountain, California. Dr. C. F.
    Winslow sent this fragment to the Boston Natural History Society, but
    no importance was attached to it, since no other evidence other than
    that furnished by workmen in the mine could be obtained. Subsequently,
    when an entire skull was reported to have been found in the gold drift
    near Angelos in Calaveras County, in a shaft one hundred and fifty
    feet deep, the intelligent portion of the community pronounced the
    finder guilty of a scientific fraud, and it is not yet a certainty
    that their decision was incorrect. However, Professor Whitney, of the
    State Geological Survey, upon hearing of the case examined the mine,
    and found that the shaft passed through five beds of lava and volcanic
    tufa and four beds of auriferous gravel. It was in one of these beds
    that the skull was said to have been found. Some of the cemented gravel
    was still adhering to the skull when it came into the Professor’s
    possession, and Professor Wyman, to whom it was submitted subsequently,
    refers to the difficulty which he had in removing the incrustation.
    Professor Whitney, on the testimony of the possessor of the skull,
    pronounced it an authentic “find,” and while his decision has been
    acquiesced in by a number of scientific gentlemen of repute, Professor
    Wyman among them, still the great majority, we believe, are unwilling
    to rest their faith on such slender evidence. Though no crack was
    apparent through which the skull might have fallen from the surface,
    such might have existed at an earlier period. In a region which is the
    product of volcanic action there is room for suspicion, especially in
    cases like both of these, where, as Sir Charles Lyell has said, no
    geologist was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>present at the moment of discovery to see the fossil
    <i>in situ</i> and extricate it with his own hands from the matrix
    which contained it.</p>

  <p>President Edward Orton, of the Ohio State University, recently called
    our attention to the discovery of relics of human workmanship found
    many years ago near Waynesville, Ohio, at the depth of over twelve feet
    below the surface. Dr. Robert Furnas, a clergyman of the Society of
    Friends, courteously furnished us the following statement: “The relic
    was obtained about the year 1824. It was in the process of digging
    a well for my grandfather. My father, then twenty-one years of age,
    was performing the work of excavation, when at the depth of thirteen
    or fourteen feet he came to a dark mould about two feet deep, on the
    top of which was lying <em>a thimble and a piece of coarse cloth</em>
    six inches wide and a yard long. The outer edge containing the fringe
    showing the end of the <em>chain</em> or warp at the end of the fabric
    and point of fastening in weaving.” “The removal above after passing
    through the soil consisted of solid clay of a yellowish-brown color.
    The farm was purchased by my grandfather in 1803, and occupied by him
    to the time of his death in 1863. He was the pioneer of the place,
    having settled there in an unbroken forest. The location is on the
    top of the hill on the east side of the Little Miami River forty or
    fifty feet above the level of the stream. The cloth soon lost all
    traces of texture on coming in contact with the air. The thimble was
    in a pretty good state of preservation.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Professor Orton, who
    has examined the locality and studied the case in hand, expressed the
    opinion to us that it was not only authentic, but (while not amounting
    to absolute proof) seemed to associate man’s works with a deposit which
    has furnished remains of the mastodon. The Professor considers the
    dark mould referred to as that upon which the relics were lying to be
    of an inter-glacial vegetable deposit peculiar to Southern Ohio, and
    once constituting an ancient surface of the land inhabited with animal
    life.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>cloth from its coarse character bears a resemblance to
    that of the mounds, while its length of just a yard is suggestive of
    more modern measurements.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

  <p>Dr. C. C. Abbott has unquestionably discovered many palæolithic
    implements in the glacial drift in the valley of the Delaware River
    near Trenton, New Jersey. Among a number of rude implements from the
    undisturbed gravel of the region is a spear-head, found six feet from
    the surface, on the site of the Lutheran Church, Broad Street, Trenton,
    N. J. The circumstances surrounding it were such as to justify the
    conclusion that the weapon had not gotten into its position where found
    “subsequently to the deposition of the containing layer of pebbles.”
    Subsequent investigation has brought to light sixty well finished flint
    implements, all of them from what appears to be undisturbed drift.
    Some of the relics have as many as from twenty to forty planes of
    cleavage, all equally weathered. The specimens are not unlike their
    neolithic counterparts taken from the aboriginal graves and stone cists
    of Tennessee.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Dr. Abbott concludes that the gravel, boulders,
    and rude implements associated with them were deposited by ice-rafts
    on the descent of a glacier down the valley, and that man more rude
    and ancient than the red Indian dwelt at the foot of the glacier,
    being driven south by its advance and following it again to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>north
    upon its return.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Professors Shaler and Pumpelly, however, while
    considering the deposit as of glacial origin, think it was subsequently
    modified by water-action. Dr. Abbott, with great fairness, admits that,
    “Inasmuch as such subsequent action may have occurred long after the
    final deposition of the gravel, as true glacial drift, the antiquity of
    the contained stone implements is proportionately lessened.” Professor
    Shaler, after a partial examination of the locality, remarks that “if
    these remains are really those of man, they prove the existence of
    inter-glacial man on this part of our shore.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Dr. Abbott and Prof.
    Aug. R. Grote believe that the Eskimo is the surviving representative
    of paleolithic and glacial man in North America. The latter believes
    that man reached this continent during the Pliocene, and before the
    ice-period had interfered with a warm climate in the north.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
    Recently Dr. Abbott has said: “It may be that, as investigations are
    carried further, it will result not so much in proving man of very
    great antiquity, as in showing how much more recent than usually
    supposed was the final disappearance of the glacier.”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> On
    <a href="#Page_30">page 30</a> we referred to mounds examined in the North-west, N. lat. 47°, W.
    long. 98° 38´, by General H. W. Thomas.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> In these mounds crania
    indicating a very low type of intelligence were discovered—in form
    resembling skulls of the great Gibbon monkey.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> From the standpoint
    of the development<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> theory (and by this we do not mean evolution, but
    that progression which takes place when a savage advances from his
    low state toward civilization), the evidences are abundant that man
    is older by far on the Western side of the continent and perhaps in
    the North-west, than elsewhere in the new world. Though this discovery
    by General Thomas does not reach back in antiquity to geologic times,
    still it cannot be denied that a considerable period must have elapsed
    before low-type crania of the North-west could have developed into the
    crania of the Ohio Valley Mounds. Professor James Orton, in commenting
    on the investigations of Wilson on the coast of Equador, refers to the
    discovery of gold, copper and stone vestiges of a former population
    in the system of terraces traced from the coast through the province
    of Esmeraldas to Quito. He remarks: “In all cases these relics are
    situated below high-tide mark, in a bed of marine sediment, from which
    he (Wilson) infers that this part of the country formerly stood higher
    above the sea. If this be true, vast must be the antiquity of these
    remains, for the upheaval and subsidence of the coast is exceedingly
    slow.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The antiquity of man in Europe is an established fact, but
    how <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>remote is a question which science as yet fails to answer. When
    geologic research opens up Central Asia, no doubt man will be found to
    have existed there a long period anterior to his advent in Europe. But
    for the decadence of Arabic glory and learning we should now probably
    be in possession of a fund of information concerning that region as
    well as of man’s early history. Were the discovery of the human skull
    in the gold drift of California an authentic case, we should have
    strong reasons for supposing a remote intercourse existed between Asia
    and the Pacific coast. It is quite certain the crania of the North-west
    Mounds, as compared with those of the Mississippi region, clearly point
    to that fact. We have seen that as yet no truly scientific proof of
    man’s great antiquity in America exists. This conclusion is concurred
    in by most eminent authorities.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> At present we are probably
    not warranted in claiming for him a much longer residence on this
    continent than that assigned him by Sir John Lubbock, namely, 3,000
    years. Future research may develop the fact that man is as old here
    as in Europe, and that he was contemporaneous with the Mastodon. As
    the case stands in the present state of knowledge, it furnishes strong
    presumptive evidence that man is not autochthonic here, but exotic,
    having originated in the old world, perhaps thousands of years prior to
    reaching the new.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">VARIOUS perplexing problems presented themselves to the minds of
    the discoverers of the new continent for solution, as well as to
    their immediate successors, which were greatly intensified by the
    dogmatic teaching of the times. The status of science in the Middle
    Ages was defined from time to time by some ecclesiastical utterance
    without any reference to the phenomena of nature or the revelations
    of accidental discovery. We say accidental, for no designed or
    systematic investigation was so much as tolerated, much less encouraged
    by friendly recognition. This unfortunate antagonism to progress
    had its foundation chiefly in ignorance, and its origin in the
    misinterpretation and perversion of Sacred Scripture.</p>

  <p>Two questions, especially in view of the dogmatic utterances of the
    day, presented grave difficulties to the minds of the discoverers and
    their successors in the New World. “Is the world a sphere?” “Are the
    Inhabitants of the Indias of a common origin with the rest of mankind?”
    These were the most serious problems that forced themselves upon their
    consideration. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> long ago as 280 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, the investigations
    of Aristarchus of Samos, though not accepted by antiquity, suggested
    an affirmative answer to the first question. But the Fathers of the
    Church had spoken authoritatively on this subject at quite an early
    day, and consequently left no room for speculation. St. Augustine
    discusses the question as follows: “But as to the fable that there are
    antipodes, that is to say, men on the opposite side of the earth, where
    the sun rises when it sets to us, men who walk with their feet opposite
    ours, that is on no ground credible. And, indeed, it is not affirmed
    that this has been learned by historical knowledge, but by scientific
    conjecture, on the ground that the earth is suspended within the cavity
    of the sky, and that it has as much room on the one side of it as on
    the other; hence they say that the part which is beneath us must also
    be inhabited. But they do not remark that although it be supposed or
    scientifically demonstrated that the world is of a round and spherical
    form, yet it does not follow that the other side of the earth is bare
    of water; or even though it be bare, does it immediately follow that
    it is peopled. For Scripture, which proves the truth of its historical
    statements by the accomplishment of its prophecies, gives no false
    information; and it is too absurd to say that some men might have taken
    ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this world to
    the other, and that thus even the inhabitants of that distant region
    are descended from that one first man.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

  <p>Though, during the kalifate of Al-Mamoun (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 813–833)
    Arabic learning had well-nigh demonstrated the globular form of
    the earth and determined its circumference, according to their
    measurements, to be about 24,000 miles, still not a man in Christendom
    ventured to advocate the theory for almost half a dozen <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>centuries,
    such was the power of the ban put upon investigation which ran counter
    to the pre-expressed opinions of a dark age. The theories of Tascanelli
    and the observations of Columbus on the polar star prepared the way for
    the great triumph achieved by De Gama in 1497–8, in his voyage around
    the Cape of Good Hope; and the question of the globular form of the
    earth was forever set at rest twenty-two years afterwards by the voyage
    of Magellan.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> When it was definitely determined that America was a
    continent of itself and not the eastern extremity of India, the fact
    that it was inhabited gave rise to speculations which have since been
    often repeated. Through an unaccountable misapprehension, not only
    the questions of the origin of the Americans, but the manner of their
    separation from the rest of the race, together with the routes they
    pursued in reaching the new world—all were thought to be capable of
    solution by the light of Scripture. The education of the early writers
    enables us to account for the intolerance with which they looked upon
    any other solution of the problem than that which alone would conform
    to the teachings of the church.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

  <p>It is true that the natural nobility of character possessed by such
    writers as Las Casas, Duran and a few others, tempered the fanaticism
    which had been inculcated by education, and enabled <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>them to furnish
    invaluable information concerning the real condition and traditions
    of the so-called Indians. But, upon the other hand, there were great
    numbers of blind, unscrupulous ecclesiastics who either destroyed
    outright the manuscripts and picture-writing of the natives, committing
    them to the flames, or so warping tradition in order that it might
    conform to their mistaken theology, that in many cases the most
    precious information is irretrievably lost. Such men could hardly be
    expected to have treated calmly and with any degree of liberality
    the question before us—one which has so often been asked, but as yet
    never satisfactorily answered, and one which in the present state of
    knowledge cannot be.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

  <p>The unanimity with which the most celebrated writers on the Americans
    during three centuries following the discovery, fixed upon a solution
    of the problem, will be best illustrated in the following pages: One of
    the most ingenious and at the same time most calmly expressed opinions
    on the origin problem is that recorded by Father Duran, a native of
    Tezcuco in Mexico, in his <cite>History of New Spain</cite>, written in
    the year 1585.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>He was convinced that the natives had a foreign
    origin, and that they performed a long journey of many years duration
    in their migration to the new world. He arrived at these conclusions
    on account of several considerations, some of which are as follows:
    The natives had no definite knowledge of their origin, some claiming
    to have proceeded from fountains and springs of water, others that
    they were natives of certain caves, and others that they were created
    by the gods, while all admit that they had come from other lands.
    Furthermore, they preserved in their traditions and pictures the memory
    of a journey in which they had suffered hunger, thirst, nakedness and
    all manner of afflictions, “with which,” he adds, “my opinion and
    supposition is confirmed that these natives are of the ten tribes of
    Israel that Salmanasar, king of the Assyrians, made prisoners and
    carried to Assyria in the time of Hoshea, king of Israel, and in the
    time of Hezekiah, king of Jerusalem, as can be seen in the fourth
    Book of the Kings, seventeenth chapter, where it says that Israel
    was carried away from their land to Assyria, etc., from whence, says
    Esdras, in Book Fourth, chapter third, they went to live in a land,
    remote and separated, which had never been inhabited, to which they
    had a long and tedious journey of a year and a half, for which reason
    it is supposed these people are found in all the islands and lands of
    the ocean constituting the Occident.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The preceding opinion was
    concurred in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>by many Spanish writers; but the first English writer to
    support the theory was Thorowgood, in his work entitled, <cite>Jewes in
    America</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> L’Estrange, who replied to this work, controverted
    the theory of the lost tribes of Israel, but concluded that Shem
    was the progenitor of the Americans; that he was ninety-eight years
    old at the time of the flood, and was not present at the building
    of Babel.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> “Thus far,” he quaintly remarks, “have I offered my
    week conceptions, first, how America may be collected to have bin
    first planted, not denying the Jewes leave to goe into America, but
    not admitting them to be the chief or prime planters thereof, for I
    am of opinion, that the Americans originated before the captivity of
    the ten tribes, even from Shem’s near progeny.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Garcia presents
    an argument in favor of the same theory, based upon the presence of
    Scripture names in Peru and Yucatan. He is positive that the word Peru
    has the same meaning as Ophir, the name of the grandson of Heber,
    from whom the Hebrews derive their name. In Yucatan he also finds the
    name Ioctan, identical with that of Ophir’s father.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>However,
    with a determination not to be surpassed by any other theorist who
    might assume the unity of the race as the basis of his conjectures,
    he offers a plan for populating the new world so comprehensive that
    no room was left for originality in any who might follow him in the
    same field. Hispaniola, Cuba and neighboring isles, he believed to
    have been peopled by the Carthaginians. The natives of other parts
    proceeded from the ten lost tribes; others from the people whom Ophir
    commanded to colonize Peru; others from the people living in the isle
    Atlantis; others from regions adjoining that island, and by means of it
    passed to America; others from the Greeks; others from the Phœnicians,
    and still others from the Chinese and Tartars.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Lescarbot cites
    five opinions on the subject, all based more or less on scriptural
    authority, and adds his own that the Americans were the descendants
    of Noah. He thinks it not impossible for voyagers to have reached the
    western continent when Solomon’s ships were sent on voyages of three
    years’ duration.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Herrera, with characteristic soberness, states
    that because of the lack of knowledge concerning the proximity of the
    continents at the “ends of the earth” he is unable to say positively
    from whom the natives were descended, but it seems most reasonable to
    him to suppose that they are the descendants of men who passed to the
    West Indies by the proximity of the land.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Villagutierre reiterates
    the same opinion, believing that Noah’s descendants were able to reach
    the new world either by land in some unknown quarter, or by swimming,
    or by embarking in canoes and balsas, for short distances. He supposes
    that animals reached the new continent in the first two ways.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
    Torquemada, after a long discussion of the subject, falls in with
    this view, adding, however, the opinion that, because of their color,
    they in all probability were descended from the sons and grandsons
    of Ham.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Pineda adopts substantially the preceding opinion, but
    improves upon it somewhat by pointing out the particular branch of the
    family of Ham, to which we may trace the origin of the first Americans.
    For some reason, perhaps no more apparent to himself than us, he
    designates Naphtuhim, son of Mezraim and grandson of Ham, as their
    progenitor. He thinks that the colonization was accomplished soon after
    the confusion of tongues, and may have been effected in any of the
    numerous ways we have previously mentioned. He cites the tradition of
    Votan as a proof.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Siguenza y Gongora and Sister Agnes de la Cruz,
    according to Clavigero, were the authors of this opinion, who further
    designated Egypt as the starting-point for that important expedition of
    colonists.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

  <p>Echevarria y Veitia treats the subject fully, tracing it through
    the traditions of the people. He cites their creation and flood
    myths, their account of the building of the Tower of Babel and the
    confusion of tongues, their dispersion upon the face of the earth,
    and the passage of seven families to the new world (to <i>Hue hue
    Tlappalan</i>) by means of balsas, with which they crossed rivers
    and arms of the sea which they encountered in their journey. Though
    minute in his details, he does nothing more in this respect than other
    important writers to whom we shall refer in a further chapter, except
    that his computations by means of the Mexican calendar have enabled
    him to assign dates to some of these occurrences, which, though they
    probably are not accurate, are at least interesting. His study of
    the Mexican paintings convinces him that the natives had a foreign
    origin.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The same author <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>in a part of his work refers to the
    giants as the first inhabitants of the country, but fails to state
    whether they came from the old world or not.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Ulloa thinks Noah’s
    long and aimless voyage in the ark was not without fruit to the science
    of navigation. It gave confidence to his immediate descendants, who
    no doubt were enterprising enough to construct similar vessels and
    undertake voyages in them. These, falling in with adverse winds and
    treacherous currents, were driven to strange islands and even to the
    new world, and being unable to return, became the first colonists in
    these remote regions. He thinks the custom of eating raw fish, common
    to the American tribes, was acquired during long sea voyages.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The
    Abbé Domenech’s opinion has been cited by Mr. Bancroft in his summary
    of the views of this class of writers; we presume, however, only for
    the amusement of the reader.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The Abbé, less than a score of years
    ago, committed himself to the ludicrous and antiquated theory that
    Ophir had colonized Peru.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Clavigero considers the creation, flood,
    and Babel myths of the natives sufficient evidence of unity of origin.
    He, however, believes that the migration to this continent began at a
    very early period.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

  <p>These few writers pretty well represent the opinions of their numerous
    contemporaries who, though they wrote voluminously enough on this
    subject, added nothing to what we have noted. The opinions of modern
    writers are as diverse as those of Garcia, and only surpass him in the
    ingenuity with which they press their favorite theories. Very little
    has been done in this field <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>with a true scientific spirit. Each has
    been an advocate rather than an inquirer; has had his theory to prove
    sometimes at the expense of reason and fact, and it is remarkable that
    the majority of works written by such advocates have presented the
    familiar anomaly of more learning than of probability. It is scarcely
    the province of this work to discuss these well-known productions of
    imaginative and too often credulous writers. To more than refer to them
    would be to lose sight for the time of the object before us.</p>

  <p>The claims for the Pre-Columbian colonization of this continent of
    course include most of those already mentioned, and properly are
    of two classes: First, those which fix the period of colonization
    remote enough to account for the old civilization or some phases of
    it. Second, those which avowedly are too recent to have accomplished
    that civilization. Of the first-named class there are about a dozen
    thoroughly elaborated claims, while of the second there are less
    than half that number. Mr. Warden years ago treated them all in a
    manner and with a fullness which has not been excelled by any more
    recent writer.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Though it is due to Mr. Bancroft to say that
    never before has the subject been so exhaustively handled in our own
    language as by him.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> As nothing new has been developed in this
    field of speculation since Mr. Bancroft, and we might add since Mr.
    Warden treated it, and as nothing could be contributed either to
    the sciences of ethnology or archæology by a repetition of the old
    discussion here, for we have our doubts whether any of the claims can
    ever be substantiated at all, we will content ourselves with the simple
    enumeration of the theories. A theory which rivals in antiquity, if
    Egyptian chronology is reliable, the claims of the Fathers that the
    immediate descendants of Noah peopled the new world shortly after the
    deluge, is that which seeks to establish the truth of the tradition
    told to Solon by the Egyptian priests of Psenophis, Sonchis, Heliopolis
    and Sais concerning the ancient <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>island Atlantis. Critias, whose
    grandfather had heard the tradition from Solon, communicated it to
    Socrates. Plato first committed it to writing, and states that the
    events which it described occurred nine thousand Egyptian years before
    Solon heard it. After speaking of the “Atlantic Sea,” the priest adds
    “that sea was indeed navigable, and had an island fronting that mouth
    which you call the Pillars of Hercules; and this island was larger
    than Libya and Asia put together, and there was a passage hence for
    travellers of that day to the rest of the islands, as well as from
    those islands to the whole opposite continent that surrounds the real
    sea. For as respects what is within the mouth here mentioned, it
    appears to be a bay with a kind of narrow entrance, and that sea is
    indeed a true sea, and the land that entirely surrounds it may truly
    and most correctly be called a continent.” The priest concludes his
    account with the statement that an earthquake in a single night buried
    the entire island and its inhabitants. This mysterious island has been
    sought for in every quarter of the globe; but the fact that part of
    the description seems applicable to the West Indies and the Gulf of
    Mexico, has led theorists to place its submerged shores between that
    locality and the Cape Verde or Canary groups. It is claimed that this
    imaginary land bridge, this backbone of earth and rock, may have once
    been the connecting link between the two continents. The claim has had
    many champions, but none so celebrated as the lamented Abbé Brasseur
    de Bourbourg. The labors of this learned Américaniste are too well
    known to require comment.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The Codex Chimalpopoca, a Nahua MS. of
    anonymous authorship, which served the Abbé as the chief <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>authority for
    the Toltec Period of his <cite>Histoire des Nations Civilisées</cite>, is
    the basis upon which he rests the advocacy of his “Atlantic Theory.”
    This singular Codex, which appears to the eyes of the uninitiated to be
    only “A History of the Kingdoms of Culhuacan and Mexico,” he considers
    susceptible of an allegorical interpretation, in which he reads the
    history and fate of that first of the continents, on whose soil
    originated all civilization and whose inhabitants were the genii of the
    arts, the origin of which are without even a tradition.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

  <p>The popularity of the Jewish theory at an early date has been indicated
    by our citations from some of the Spanish missionaries. Garcia, after
    a seven years residence in Peru, wrote his work for the purpose of
    proving conclusively that the Jews had been the chief colonists of
    the continent at an early date. He elaborated the argument set forth
    by Father Duran,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> which is founded on passages in Esdras, but
    proceeded to prop up this theory with a catalogue of analogies between
    the Jews and Americans, some of which are so remote from each other
    that the very attempt to assimilate them is simply puerile. Garcia
    has had many disciples, some of whom have been no more critical than
    himself.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The illustrious advocate of the Jewish colonization of
    America was that indefatigable antiquary, Lord Kingsborough. No more
    masterly, no abler and more exhaustive defence was ever made in behalf
    of a hopeless and even baseless claim than his; and as the result, the
    historian and antiquary has placed at his disposal fac-simile prints
    of most of the important hieroglyphic MSS. of Mexican authorship
    deposited in the various libraries of Europe, as well as pictures
    of the architecture and stone records common to ancient America.
    We must confess that the work itself, with its curious plates, its
    maze of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>notes and references, its masterly and novel discoveries of
    analogies, though many of them are imaginary, is to us, after prolonged
    examination, as much of a riddle as the great and improbable theory
    which it seeks to establish.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Closely allied to the theory of the
    ten lost tribes, is the claim set forth in that pretentious fraud, the
    Book of Mormon, which attributes the colonization of North America,
    soon after the confusion of tongues, to a people called Jaredites, who,
    by divine guidance, reached our shores in eight vessels, and developed
    a high state of civilization on our soil. These first colonists,
    however, became extinct about six centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, because of
    their social sins. The Jaredites were followed by a second colony, this
    time of Israelites, who left Jerusalem in the first year of the reign
    of Zedekiah, King of Juda. They reached the Indian Ocean by following
    the shores of the Red Sea, where they built a vessel which bore them
    across the Pacific to the western coast of South America. Having
    arrived in the new land of promise, they separated into two parties,
    called Nephites and Laminites respectively, after their leaders. They
    grew to be great nations and colonized North America also. Religious
    strife sprang up between the two nations because of the wickedness
    of the Laminites; the Nephites, however, adhered to their religious
    traditions and the worship of the true God. Christ appeared in the new
    world and by his ministrations converted many of both peoples to Him.
    But towards the close of the fourth century of our era, both Laminites
    and Nephites backslid in faith and became involved in a war with
    each other which resulted in the extermination of the latter people.
    The numerous tumuli scattered over the face of the country cover the
    remains of the hundreds of thousands of warriors who fell in their
    deadly strife. Mormon and his son Morani, the last of the Nephites
    who escaped by concealment, deposited by divine command the annals of
    their ancestors, the Book of Mormon written on tablets, in the hill of
    Cumorah, Ontario County, New York, in the vicinity of which the last
    battle of these relentless enemies took place.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>claim, of
    course, merits mention only on the ground of its romantic character,
    and not on the supposition for a moment that it contains a grain of
    truth. The Phœnician and Carthaginian colonization of this continent
    has been much discussed and credited by a larger number of Americanists
    than any other theory, except that which refers the original population
    to those parts of Asia adjacent to Alaska. This claim is based on the
    maritime achievements of that nation of navigators. The three-year
    voyages of Hiram and Solomon’s fleet to Ophir and Tarshish, has often
    been made to do service for this theory. Ophir has most frequently
    been placed by its advocates in Hayti or Peru.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Such speculations,
    however, are incapable of proof, and are scarcely deserving of sober
    consideration. The theory itself is one of the few that command
    respectful attention, since tradition, history, and many facts in
    natural science, seem to point to its probability.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Mr. Bancroft
    refers at some length to the voyage of Hanno, a Carthaginian navigator,
    whose exploits beyond the pillars of Hercules, with a fleet of sixty
    ships and thirty thousand men, is recorded in his <cite>Periplus</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
    With true critical insight, Mr. Bancroft rejects the opinion that
    Hanno reached America, and thinks he only coasted along the shores of
    Africa.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The only tradition preserved by the Americans is that of
    the mysterious Votan, whom some have sought to assign to a Phœnician
    nativity.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Of late years the theory of the Phœnician colonization
    has failed to receive its share of support from new writers. This
    is owing probably to the fact that the labors of Mr. George Jones,
    embodied in his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span><cite>Original History of Ancient America Founded on the
    Ruins of Antiquity; the Identity of the Aborigines with the People of
    Tyrus and Israel, and the Introduction of Christianity by the Apostle
    St. Thomas</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> may have rendered all such support unnecessary. It
    is more probable, however, that the assumption and credulity displayed
    in this extraordinary work have discouraged any critical writer from
    aspiring to the honor of having his name transmitted to posterity
    as an advocate of the Phœnician theory, side by side with that of
    the author of the Original History. We have no space to devote to so
    positive a writer, except to state that he colonizes America with a
    remnant of the inhabitants of Tyre who escaped from their island-city
    when it was besieged by Alexander the Great in 332 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>
    They sailed out beyond the Pillars of Hercules to their colonies in
    the Canaries, whence the trade-winds bore them across the Atlantic to
    the shores of Florida. Ezekiel xxvii. 26, is quoted as proof: “Thy
    rowers have brought thee into great waters; the east wind hath broken
    thee in the midst of the seas.”<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The theory that the ancient
    Americans descended from the Greeks has been incidentally advocated
    by several authors, most of the arguments being based upon supposed
    Greek inscriptions. Two advocates of the theory are, however, quite
    decided in its defence, namely, Mr. Pidegeon<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and Mr. Lafitau.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
    The latter <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>believing that the ancient inhabitants of the Grecian
    archipelago were driven from their country by Og, king of Bashan,
    supposes the inhabitants of the new world descended from that people,
    and cites numerous analogies of a political and social nature.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> No
    claim has been advanced, we believe, which advocates an actual Egyptian
    colonization of the new world, but strong arguments have been used
    to show that the architecture and sculpture of Central America and
    Mexico have been influenced from Egypt, if not attributable directly to
    Egyptian artisans. These arguments are based on the resemblance between
    the gigantic pyramids, the sculptured obelisks, and the numerous idols
    of these pre-historic countries and those of Egypt. It requires no
    practised eye to trace a resemblance in general features, though it
    must be said that the details of American architecture and sculpture,
    are peculiarly original in design.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The principal advocate of
    the theory, Delafield, has furnished many comparisons, but we think
    no argument has been presented sufficiently supported by facts to
    prove that American architecture and sculpture had any other than an
    indigenous origin.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Turning westward our attention is arrested
    by the probability of the theory which claims that this continent
    was peopled with the Tartars and nations occupying the regions of
    North-western Asia. No one can consider the natural certainty of
    long-continued communication between the two continents at Behring’s
    Straits without being impressed with the truth that that narrow channel
    served probably as the first highway between the old world and the new,
    and <i>vice versa</i>. Certainly a part of the ancient population of
    America came upon our soil at that quarter. Mr. Bancroft remarks: “The
    customs, manner <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>of life, and physical appearance of the natives on
    both sides of the straits are identical, as a multitude of witnesses
    testify, and it seems absurd to argue the question from any point. Of
    course, Behring’s Strait may have served to admit other nations besides
    the people inhabiting its shores into America, and in such cases there
    is more room for discussion.”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Nearly as plausible is the theory
    which claims that if the original population of this continent were not
    Japanese, at least a considerable infusion of Japanese blood into the
    original stock has taken place from time to time, either by intentional
    colonization or by the accidents incident to navigation. The great
    number of shipwrecks which are continually being cast upon our Pacific
    coast by the Japanese current or Kuro-suvo are constant and substantial
    witnesses to the reasonableness of the claim.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

  <p>The Chinese colonization theory, unfortunately, does not date far
    enough back to account for the oldest American civilization. It is
    nevertheless remote enough, were it proven true, to considerably
    antedate the Aztec and Inca periods. Upwards of a century ago the
    learned French sinologist Deguignes announced that he had found in the
    writings of early Chinese historians the statement that in the fifth
    century of our era certain adventurers of their race had discovered
    a country which they called Fusang.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> He further expressed it as
    his opinion that the country described must be Western America, and
    probably Mexico. The original document on which the Chinese historians
    base their statements was the report of a Buddhist missionary named
    Hoei-Shin, who in the year 499 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, claims to have returned
    from a long journey of discovery to the remote and unknown east.
    This report, whatever may be its intrinsic value, was accepted as
    true by the Chinese, and found its way into the history of Li yan
    tcheon—written at the beginning of the seventh century of our era. In
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>1841, Dr. Neumann, Professor of Oriental Languages and History at
    Munich, after a residence of a couple of years at Canton, published a
    translation of the narrative of Hoei-Shin with comments upon it.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> A
    few of the most striking passages of the account given by this Buddhist
    missionary are as follows: “Fusang is about 20,000 Chinese <i>li</i> in
    an easterly direction from Tahan and east of the Middle Kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
    Many Fusang trees grow there whose leaves resemble the <i>Dryanda
    cordifolia</i>; the sprouts, on the contrary, resemble those of the
    bamboo tree, and are eaten by the inhabitants of the land. The fruit
    is like a pear in form, but is red. From the bark they prepare a sort
    of linen which they use for clothing, and also a sort of ornamental
    stuff. The houses are built of wooden beams; fortified and walled
    places are there unknown. They have written characters in this land,
    and prepare paper from the bark of the Fusang. The people have no
    weapons and make no wars, but in the arrangement of the kingdom, they
    have a northern and southern prison. Trifling offenders are lodged in
    the southern prison, but those confined for greater offences in the
    northern. The name of the king is pronounced Ichi. The color of his
    clothes changes with the different years. The horns of the oxen are so
    large that they hold ten bushels. They use them to contain all manner
    of things. Horses, oxen, and stags are harnessed to their wagons.
    Stags are used here as cattle are used in the Middle Kingdom, and
    from the milk of the hind they make butter. No iron is found in the
    land; but copper, gold, and silver are not prized, and do not serve
    as a medium of exchange in the market. Marriage is determined upon in
    the following manner: the suitor builds himself a hut before the door
    of the house where the one longed for dwells, and waters and cleans
    the ground every evening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> When a year has passed by, if the maiden
    is not inclined to marry him he departs; should she be willing it is
    completed. In earlier times these people lived not according to the
    laws of Buddha, but it happened that in the second year—named ‘Great
    Light’ of Song (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 458)—five beggar-monks from the kingdom
    of Kipin went to this land, extended over it the religion of Buddha,
    and with it his early writings and images. They instructed the people
    in the principles of monastic life, and so changed their manners.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
    Dr. Neumann does not claim that the Chinese Fusang tree is identical
    with the Maguay plant, but that the resemblance between it and the
    great numbers of the latter found in Mexico suggested a name for the
    country to the discoverer. The uncertainty as to the distance, arising
    out of our inability to determine what was considered the length of a
    Chinese <i>li</i> in the fifth century, is of course an obstacle to the
    satisfactory solution of the question. The amusing and preposterous
    statement as to the size of the horns of oxen is no argument against
    the general truth of the narrative, since we have no data from which
    to determine the capacity of the measure, the name of which is here
    translated bushel, since the widest possible difference exists between
    the ancient and modern Chinese tables of measurement. The references to
    horses and oxen are perplexing, and give the narrative the air either
    of imposture or mistake, since both were brought to America first by
    the Spaniards.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The argument by the opponents of this theory that
    Fusang was Japan stands on a very slender foundation, since at a very
    early period, centuries before our era, Japan afforded naval stations
    for Chinese ships.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Klaproth, and later Dr. E. Bretschneider,
    designated the island of Tarakai, known as Saghalien on our maps, as
    the Fusang of Hoei-Schin.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>M. D’Eichthal and Professor Neumann
    have both made able arguments in defence of the authenticity and
    reasonableness of this claim, but there are too many uncertainties
    about it to admit of its unqualified acceptance. We are more disposed
    to give credence to the theory that the Chinese discovered America at
    a very early day, than to attach much importance to the particular
    account of that discovery by Hoei-Shin. The theory is a good one,
    with an abundance of geographical and ethnological testimony in its
    favor.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

  <p>Closely allied to the Chinese theory is that so enthusiastically
    advocated by Ranking, who maintains that the Mongol emperor Kublai
    Khan, in the thirteenth century sent a large fleet against Japan, but
    that the vast armada was destroyed by a tempest, and a portion of
    its ships were wrecked on the shores of Peru.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The first Inca he
    believes was the son of Kublai Khan. It is a well-known fact that the
    Mongol fleet was dispersed by a storm, but there are grave objections
    to the opinion that any of the vessels were cast upon the shores of
    South America. No tradition was found among the Peruvians only three
    centuries later concerning the Incas or any other people having reached
    their shores by the accident of shipwreck, or who could be identified
    as of Asiatic origin. It is true the Incas may have designed to keep
    their human origin as well as their misfortunes a secret, that they
    might the better set up their claim to imperial and divine honors among
    the people whom they sought to subjugate by that most powerful ally to
    ambition—superstition. Mr. Ranking wrote a very plausible book, but
    often fell into errors of credulity and unrestrained enthusiasm which
    leaves many of his statements open to suspicion. The theory cannot be
    accepted <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>without additional and more satisfactory proof.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Should
    it prove to be true, it certainly cannot throw light upon the origin of
    the population, but only on a phase of civilization. Humboldt, Tschudi,
    Viollet-le-Duc, Count Stolberg and other writers have pointed out
    striking analogies between the religion of Southern Asia, especially
    of India and that of Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> If the argument from analogy is to
    be relied on, there is abundant reason to believe that Buddhism in a
    modified form had permeated the religious systems of the new world with
    its mystic element besides grafting upon them some of its better and
    more humane institutions.</p>

  <p>These are all the colonization claims worth mentioning, which date
    back far enough to account for the ancient civilization. Of the
    second class (those too recent to have made much impression on the
    existing state of things) there are three. The earliest of these as
    to date, is the claim which credits the Irish with the colonization
    of the Atlantic coast from North Carolina to Florida. “White-Man’s
    Land,” so often located in this country, is no doubt imaginary. The
    obscure and unsatisfactory chronicle which forms the basis of this
    claim destroys its own authority by the statement that White-Man’s
    Land was six days’ sail from Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Another legend set forth by
    Broughton, which claims that St. Patrick preached the Gospel in the
    “Isles of America,” carries its own refutation upon its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>face by the
    use of the word America in its text.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The Scandinavian discovery
    of America is a well-known fact, and requires no discussion here. The
    <cite>Codex Flatioiensis</cite>, as expounded by the learned Prof. Rafn in
    the <cite>Antiquitates Americanæ</cite>, has, no doubt, set at rest the whole
    matter. Humboldt, in reviewing the evidence upon which the claim is
    founded, sums it up in these words: “The discovery of the northern
    part of America by the Northmen cannot be disputed. The length of the
    voyage, the direction in which they sailed, the time of the sun’s
    rising and setting, are accurately given. While the caliphate of Bagdad
    was still flourishing under the Abbassides, and while the rule of the
    Samanides, so favorable to poetry, still flourished in Persia, America
    was discovered about the year 1000 by Lief, son of Eric the Red, at
    about 41½° north latitude.” No evidence of a substantial character has
    been produced to show that the Scandinavians left any impress upon the
    American civilization. It is true, Brasseur de Bourbourg, when he first
    began his labors in the field of American archæology expressed such
    an opinion, but we believe he never repeated it in the latter years
    of his life.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The learned Abbé was guilty of many contradictions,
    and this may be considered one of them. The most positive claims in
    this direction are advanced by two recent authors, M. Gravier<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> and
    Prof. Anderson,<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> the former attributing the Aztec civilization to
    Norse influence. He cites the discovery in Brazil of an ancient city
    near Bahia, in which was found the statue of a man pointing with his
    forefinger to the North Pole; of course, according to M. Gravier, he
    was a Northman.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Several authorities for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>the discovery of Norse
    remains in the United States might be cited, but the unwarrantable
    arguments of most of them add nothing to the already established
    fact of Norse colonization in the tenth century of our era. Another
    Pre-Columbian claim to the discovery of America is that which declares
    Madoc-Ap-owen and his Welsh countrymen to have reached this continent
    in 1170 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> The chronicle on which the claim is based, is
    wanting in authority. A translation of it, taken from a history of
    Wales by Dr. Powell, was published by Hakluyt, in 1589. As this claim
    can have no relation to our subject, we refrain from a discussion of it
    here.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The only remaining theory, and probably the most important
    of all, because of its purely scientific character, which presents
    itself for our consideration, is that which not only considers the
    civilization of ancient America to have been indigenous, but also
    claims the inhabitants themselves to have been autochthonic; in a word,
    that by process of evolution or in some other way, the first Americans
    were either developed from a lower order in the animal kingdom or were
    created on the soil of this continent. As the latter theory involves a
    denial of the unity of the race, it requires a separate and critical
    examination.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE want of evidence for the theories which designate particular
    nations as the first colonizers of the Western Continent, long ago
    produced a feeling of distrust, which led some to repudiate all claims
    for the foreign origin of the first inhabitants of this continent. This
    theory, which claims for the most ancient inhabitants an autochthonic
    origin, has had from time to time among its advocates some of the
    most respectable ethnologists. The character of their attainments,
    and in many cases their arguments in behalf of this most remarkable
    hypothesis, command the respect of all who are interested in this
    fascinating field of speculation.</p>

  <p>At first it was maintained that the Creator had placed an original
    pair of human beings here, as Scripture teaches that He did in the old
    world.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Other writers equally confident that the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>first ancestors
    of the American race were indigenous, have not so definitely expressed
    themselves as to the manner of their origin.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The most recent phase
    of the autochthonic theory is that which designates evolution as the
    means by which the continent was populated with human beings, developed
    from its own fauna. This latter question is now the most absorbing
    of all that occupy <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>the attention of the American Anthropologists.
    But to go back to the separate creation view, we find it expressed in
    general and unscientific utterances at first, mostly based on the hasty
    observation of travellers who, in many cases, had little knowledge
    of anthropologic or ethnic principles. In fact, the subject was not
    fairly discussed and its advocacy based on satisfactory investigation
    until the justly celebrated Dr. Samuel G. Morton, of Philadelphia,
    issued his <cite>Crania Americana</cite>, containing the results of the most
    diligent researches on the skulls of the Mound-builders, Mexicans,
    Peruvians, and many of the known tribes of the Red Indians. In the face
    of abundant proof among the crania of his own splendid collection, and
    contrary to the testimony of his numerous measurements, which have
    often since been used against his theory, this diligent investigator
    arrived at the conclusion that the Americans were a distinct race,
    originated in this continent, having a uniform cranial type (excepting
    only the Eskimo), from the Arctic Circle to Patagonia.</p>

  <p>A division, however, of this supposed homogeneous race was made by this
    author into Toltecan and Barbarous nations; the former appellative
    comprising all the semi-civilized peoples, while the latter embraced
    the wild tribes. All were believed to have had the same origin and to
    belong to the same cranial type. “It is curious to observe, however,”
    remarks Dr. Morton, “that the Barbarous nations possess a larger brain
    by five and a half cubic inches than the Toltecans; while, on the
    other hand, the Toltecans possess a greater relative capacity of the
    anterior chamber of the skull in the proportion of 42.3 to 41.8. Again
    the coronal region, though absolutely greater in the Barbarous tribes,
    is rather larger in proportion in the semi-civilized tribes; and the
    facial-angle is much the same in both, and may be assumed for the race
    at 75°.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> In conclusion, the author is of the opinion that the
    facts contained in his work tend to sustain the following propositions:
    (1) “That the American race differs essentially from all others, not
    excepting the Mongolian; nor do the feeble analogies of language, and
    the more obvious ones in civil and religious institutions and the
    arts, denote anything beyond <span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>casual or colonial communication with
    the Asiatic nations; and even these analogies may perhaps be accounted
    for, as Humboldt suggested, in the mere coincidence arising from
    similar wants and impulses in nations inhabiting similar latitudes.”
    (2) “That the American nations, excepting the Polar tribes, are one
    race and one species, but of two great families which resemble each
    other in physical, but differ in intellectual character.” (3) “That
    the cranial remains discovered in the mounds, from Peru to Wisconsin,
    belong to the same race and probably to the Toltecan family.”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
    Among the several ethnologists and naturalists who accepted without
    question the conclusions reached by Morton, the chief was Agassiz,
    who adopted them as auxiliary to his theory of the correspondence of
    human life with certain associations in the animal kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> They
    served as a sure foundation, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>so far as this continent is concerned,
    for his opinion that the races originated in nations. “We maintain,”
    says the eminent naturalist, “that, like all organized beings, mankind
    cannot have originated in single individuals, but must have been
    created in that numerical harmony which is characteristic of each
    species. Men must have originated in <em>nations</em>, as the bees have
    originated in swarms, and as the different social plants have covered
    the extensive tracts over which they have naturally spread.”<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
    This view has been enlarged upon by Messrs. Nott and Gliddon, who
    argue that, “if it be conceded that there were two primitive pairs of
    human beings, no reason can be assigned why there may not have been
    hundreds.”<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The uniqueness of the so-called American race not only
    fails of proof, but is positively disproven by the measurements of
    crania accompanying Morton’s plates, and any thoughtful person cannot
    avoid surprise that so distinguished a scholar as Agassiz should
    have committed himself to a theory without first submitting it to a
    crucial test. That there is a great variety of type observable among
    the crania figured by Morton, even a superficial examination will
    show, while a more careful classification presents several facts of
    interest. For this classification we consider the simple division of
    the crania into long and short skulls sufficient. The question of other
    divisions has been often discussed, but with Mr. Huxley we content
    ourselves with the simplest classification. Referring to a particular
    instance, he says, “taking the antero-posterior diameter as 100, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>the
    transverse diameter varies from 98 or 99 to 62. The number which thus
    expresses the proportion of the transverse to the longitudinal diameter
    of the brain-case is called the <em>cephalic index</em>. Those people
    who possess crania with a cephalic index of 80 and above are called
    <em>brachycephali</em> (short-skulled), those with a lower index are
    <em>dolichocephali</em> (long-skulled).”<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Dr. Meigs, while accepting
    the classification into long and short skulls, admits that it is open
    to the objection that it forces into either and opposite classes crania
    closely related to each other in type and measurement.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Yet it must
    be admitted, that in proportion as arbitrary divisions are increased,
    these difficulties are multiplied, and that this simple, twofold
    classification presents the fewest.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> In the following tables, which
    contain all the measurements accompanying the plates in the <cite>Crania
    Americana</cite>, the <em>cephalic index</em> is placed in the left-hand
    column. That a wide difference of type is apparent between the extremes
    of the dolichocephalic and brachycephalic measurements, certainly
    cannot be denied.</p>

  <p>It will be observed that the widest range is found between the
    proportions of the skull of the Cayuga chief 100 years old (Plate XXXV)
    with a cephalic index of only 65.4, and those of some of the Peruvian
    crania having a cephalic index of over 98. The supposed Natchez skull
    (Plate LIV) is so artificially flattened as to exclude it from the
    calculation. The mean cephalic index of each of the tables exhibits a
    well-defined type of the long and the short skull respectively. The
    former 74.7 and the latter 87 are both far enough removed from the
    dividing line (80) to leave no doubt that the types are distinct and
    separate. Additional data, materially strengthening the conclusion of
    the variety of types found among American crania, has been furnished by
    that eminent authority Dr. Daniel Wilson.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The following table of

  <p>It requires no careful examination of these figures to observe that the
    type of skull among the American aborigines, ancient or modern, was in
    no sense constant, since among the same tribes long and short skulls
    occur in almost equal numbers. This fact is especially true among the
    savage Indians. Among the semi-civilized nations, however, as among the
    Peruvians and Mexicans, the long and short skulls mark the successive
    existence and destruction of distinct peoples having physiological
    characteristics peculiar to themselves. The Peruvian elongated crania
    are always found with large-boned skeletons having strong hands, while
    the short or rounded crania accompany very small bones, such as were
    unable to endure labor like the building of pyramids and the erection
    of such edifices as are found in Peru.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

  <p>It is with the utmost deference to the genius, and with full
    recognition of the valuable researches of Dr. Morton, that we disagree
    with his conclusions and pronounce his theory without foundation in
    fact. There is no evidence furnished by the measurement of crania
    that an American race, as unique in itself and distinct from the rest
    of mankind, ever existed.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> One of the most interesting studies
    connected with these tables, as well as other measurements made
    more recently, is the question of relationship between the various
    semi-civilized peoples of the ancient <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>period. First and most naturally
    the type of the mound crania attracts attention, and calls for
    comparisons with the Indian type and with that of the remarkable people
    of the more southern civilization.</p>

  <p>The “Scioto Mound” skull figured by Dr. Davis in Plates xlvii and
    xlviii of <i>The Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley</i>, was
    pronounced by Dr. Morton in Dr. Meigs’ catalogue of the human crania in
    the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, as
    “perhaps the most admirably formed head of the American race hitherto
    discovered.”</p>

  <p>The chief features as pointed out by the above-named author, are: the
    elevated vertex, flattened occiput, great inter-parietal diameter,
    ponderous bony structure, salient nose, large jaws and broad face.
    These he pronounces to be characteristics of the American cranium. Dr.
    Wilson has shown that Dr. Morton has contradicted his own previous
    definition of what that type is as well as the description given by
    Humboldt.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> The propriety of selecting any single cranium as typical
    of the Mound-builders would be as questionable in this connection as
    it was for Dr. Morton and the authors of the <cite>Types of Mankind</cite>
    to designate the Scioto Mound skull as a type of the American cranium.
    Until within a few years but few genuine mound skulls were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>accessible,
    and considerable suspicion was reasonably attached to the genuineness
    of several, including three or four of the so-called mound skulls in
    the <cite>Crania Americana</cite>. Recent explorations have brought to light
    a large number, of unquestioned genuineness. The Peabody Museum alone
    possesses 300, and of these 200 were exhumed by Prof. F. W. Putnam.</p>

  <p>From a number of measurements only is it possible for us to approximate
    the type of the mound skull. We have already referred to the low
    type skulls secured by Gen. H. W. Thomas from a mound in Dakota
    Territory.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Unfortunately we are without measurements, but from
    the description we observe that the forehead is decidedly receding,
    and the orbital ridges are excessively developed. The inferior
    maxillary is of unusual prominence and much more massive, as is the
    entire bony structure, than in the common Indian cranium. Another
    cranium of similar characteristic was exhumed from the great mound on
    the River Rouge near its junction with the Detroit River, Michigan,
    by Mr. Henry Gillman. From this mound several crania were taken, of
    which one (though evidently adult) presented the hitherto, I think I
    may say, unprecedented feature of its capacity being only fifty-six
    cubic inches. The mean given by Morton and Meigs of the Indian cranium
    is eighty-four cubic inches, the minimum being sixty-nine cubic
    inches. This cranium, forwarded with other relics to the Peabody
    Museum, presents (though in no wise deformed) the further peculiarity
    of having the ridges for the attachment of the temporal muscle only
    .75 of an inch apart, in this respect resembling the cranium of the
    chimpanzee. It is rarely that in human crania those ridges approach
    each other within a distance of two inches, while they vary from that
    to four inches apart.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Eight crania were exhumed by Mr. Gillman
    from the great mound on Rouge River, which furnished him the following
    measurements:</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The fragments of a cranium, consisting chiefly of a
    very retreating frontal, and presenting traits of a low and brutal
    character, reminding one of the Neanderthal skull, were found
    underneath the above tabulated crania.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

  <p>We observe that only three of these crania are brachycephalic, while
    the remaining five, and the mean of all, fall under the class of
    dolichocephalic crania, according to our classification. Mr. Gillman
    would call some of them Orthocephalic, and the mean of the eight crania
    giving a cephalic index of .786 and .802 as an index of height might
    properly be so classified. The same gentleman exhumed from an ancient
    mound on Chambers Island, Green Bay, Wisconsin, six crania, which as
    to type were equally divided into long and short skulls, while the
    mean cephalic index, .817, assigned them to the brachycephalic class.
    The long skulls were not far removed, however, from the dividing line
    between the classes (.80). The energetic and intelligent labors of
    Dr. R. J. Farquharson of the Davenport, Iowa, Academy of Sciences,
    has placed within our reach measurements upon twenty-five mound
    crania.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The following are the most important measurements in
    inches:</p>

  <p>This table introduces a new feature into the investigation in hand;
    the brachycephalic or the near approximation to the short skull is
    displaced by a mean cephalic index of .758, indicating the well-marked
    dolichocephalic type. The mean internal capacity 73.3 inches falls
    considerably below the mean of mound crania as measured by Squier and
    Davis, Wilson and others, from localities farther south.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

  <p>The mean results of Dr. Farquharson’s measurements<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> show a greater
    vertical than transverse diameter, a peculiarity of most Mississippi
    mound skulls, distinguishing them from Peruvian crania. In the Ohio
    Valley the brachycephalic type is quite decided, though the general
    features of high receding forehead, flattened occiput, and great
    transverse diameter, establish their relationship to all other North
    American mound crania yet discovered. Three Ohio Valley mound skulls,
    as to the genuineness of which no suspicion can be entertained, namely
    the Scioto Mound cranium and two crania from the Grave Creek Mound,
    give the following measurements in the mean: Longitudinal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>diameter,
    6.5 inches; parietal diameter, 6 inches; vertical diameter, 5.5 inches,
    and 90.7 as their cephalic index. The mean internal capacity, though
    not obtainable with any degree of accuracy, in this instance is no
    doubt from eight to ten cubic inches greater than in the Davenport
    crania. With the general characteristics alike, minor differences may
    in most instances be attributed to artificial pressure. A valuable
    collection of mound crania was made in Kentucky for the Smithsonian
    Institution and the Peabody Museum, by Mr. S. S. Lyon, and is
    thoroughly reliable as a basis for measurements. Professor Wyman, in
    the <cite>Fourth Annual Report of the Peabody Museum</cite>, describes them
    as follows: “The twenty-four crania measured (Table VIII) show a mean
    capacity of 1313 cubic centimetres, which is greater than that of the
    Peruvians, but less than that of the North American Indians generally
    (viz., 1376 cubic centimetres, or 84 cubic inches). They differ also
    from those of the ordinary Indians in being lighter, less massive,
    in having the rough surface for muscular attachments less strongly
    marked. * * * In proportions they present a very considerable variation
    among themselves. Assuming the length of the skull to be 1.000,
    the breadth ranges from 0.712 to 0.950 of the length. The average
    proportion is 0.857, which places them in the short-headed group.”</p>

  <p>We have already called attention to the extensive and thorough
    work performed by Professor Joseph Jones in Tennessee, the report
    of which was published in 1876 by the Smithsonian Institution in a
    “contribution” entitled <cite>Explorations of the Aboriginal Remains
    of Tennessee</cite>. Professor Jones secured above a hundred mound and
    stone grave crania, mostly in the valley of the Cumberland and on the
    banks of the Big Harpeth River. Some of the skeletons accompanying
    these crania were of gigantic stature, a fact which is at variance
    with the opinion that they were related to the diminutive race of Inca
    Peruvians.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
    On the contrary, however, a strong argument for the
    relationship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> between the Mound-builders and the Peruvians is found in
    the frequent occurrence of the Inca-bone (<i>os inca</i>) so-called,
    on the mound crania.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
    Mr. Henry Gillman found this same bone in
    one of the crania exhumed by him from the great mound of Rouge River,
    Michigan, with a disposition to its formation in several others.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
    Professor Jones is convinced of the unity of the mound race throughout
    the entire Mississippi Basin. The following table of measurements,
    published in the <cite>Antiquities of Tennessee</cite>, is one of the most
    valuable which has yet been prepared:</p>

  <p>The most noticeable feature in the table aside from the mean cephalic
    index .874 is the great internal capacity of cranium No. 7, which was
    found in a stone grave in a mound near Nashville, with a skeleton over
    six feet long. The occiput is but slightly flattened, and the general
    contour of the head is symmetrically <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>oval. Morton gives as the mean
    internal capacity of fifty-two Caucasian skulls 87 cubic inches; the
    largest of the series measured 109 cubic inches, and the smallest 75
    cubic inches. This remarkable cranium gives an internal capacity of 103
    cubic inches, vastly above the mean European skull, and only falling
    six cubic inches below the largest measured by Morton. As we observed
    a considerable increase in capacity in the Scioto Mound cranium,
    with its ninety cubic inches, over the crania of the north-west and
    north, of Michigan and Davenport, so here a most remarkable advance
    upon the capacity of the Scioto cranium is presented. The evidence of
    considerable development in the size of the cranium in this same race
    is clear; and taken with other testimony, such as the great improvement
    in art and architecture, indicates probably a movement from north to
    south, and that the mound race was older in the former region than in
    the latter.</p>

  <p>In September, 1877, Prof. F. W. Putnam and Mr. Edwin Curtiss exhumed
    sixty-seven crania from stone graves located in the neighborhood of
    Nashville, Tennessee. These crania were measured by Miss Jennie Smith
    and Mr. Lucian Carr, and the latter has tabulated and described them
    in the <cite>Eleventh Annual Report of the Peabody Museum</cite> (pp. 361
    <i>et seq.</i>, Cambridge, 1878). As some interesting features occur
    in the tables, we insert here Mr. Carr’s mean measurements. It will be
    observed that the classification in this instance is threefold, besides
    the distinct position assigned to the “much flattened” crania.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>Mr. Carr calls attention to the fact that while the classified crania
    as a whole are brachycephali, still from twenty-three to thirty-three
    per cent. of the whole cannot be considered as falling within that
    group. Whether the five dolichocephali in the table belonged to the
    same race cannot be determined. They were buried together, for Prof.
    Putnam found a long and a short skull side by side in the same grave.
    Mr. A. J. Conant (see <cite>Commonwealth of Missouri</cite>, St. Louis, 1877,
    8vo, pp. 106–7) discovered in a mound in South-eastern Missouri two
    crania belonging to skeletons buried in regular order, with a large
    number of other skeletons at the bottom of the mound, which differed
    strangely from all others found in that locality. The forehead was
    entirely wanting, and the contour of the top of one of the skulls was
    almost flat. It closely resembles the Neanderthal skull. Mr. Conant
    thought it at first to be an intrusive burial, but careful examination
    proved it to have been placed in position before the building of the
    mound, and to have been interred with as much care as was bestowed upon
    any of the other occupants of the mound. Vases, drinking vessels and
    food-pans accompanied it as they did all the other skeletons.</p>

  <p>Mr. Carr thinks such crania as he has pointed out belonged to
    individuals who were conquered in war, or adopted or introduced into
    the tribe by intermarriage. Mr. Conant considers that the low type
    cranium which he discovered belonged to a very ancient race, the
    predecessors of the Mound-builders, and not far removed from the
    palæolithic races of Europe.</p>

  <p>The mound skulls are readily distinguishable from those of the Red
    Indian. Only in the Davenport crania and the five dolichocephali
    from Tennessee do we see any approximation as to form. However, the
    remaining characteristics of the Davenport crania establish the fact
    that they belonged to people of the mounds. In our classification
    of Dr. Morton’s measurements, it will be observed that only two
    <em>supposed</em> mound skulls appear among the dolichocephali (long
    skulls, A), and too much doubt is attached to their genuineness to
    admit of their use in drawing inferences. All the remainder belong
    to the savage tribes except three Peruvians of the ancient race of
    the region of Titicaca. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>In the table of brachycephali but few of the
    savage tribes are represented, except those which practice artificial
    compression to the extent of deformity. The mound skull as compared
    with the Inca Peruvian presents few resemblances, except that both
    generally belong to the brachycephalic class, and the singular and
    important fact already mentioned that the Inca bone has been found in
    North American mound crania. It is possible that when more extensive
    research is made, this distinguishing feature may lead to the
    conclusion that the races were one or closely related. On the other
    hand, the massive bony structure of some of the mound crania does not
    correspond with the facial bones of the Inca crania, which are very
    light and delicate. Prof. Wilson has pointed out the additional fact
    that the vertical diameter of the Peruvian short crania is not so great
    as that of the mound and Mexican short skulls, but a reference to the
    Professor’s own tables shows that the mean difference amounts only to
    thirty-seven-hundredths of an inch, altogether too small a variation
    to serve as the basis for ethnic generalizations.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Few if any
    similarities can be traced between the dolichocephali of Peru and the
    brachycephalic Mound-builders, the only resemblances being the heavy
    bony structure possessed in common by both races. The crania of the
    dolichocephali of Peru are pronounced of a Mongol cast and form, and
    are in every respect unlike the mound crania. Turning our attention,
    however, to the ancient Mexican crania, we find, so far as we are
    able to judge from the limited number of skulls which have come into
    the possession of ethnologists, a parallelism in measurements and
    resemblance in the various distinctive features, such as flattened
    occiput, broad transverse diameter, retreating forehead, strong bony
    structure, and a remarkable agreement in vertical diameter with those
    of the mounds of the Mississippi Basin, which point unmistakably to
    the closest relationship. Seven Mexican brachycephali measured by
    Prof. Wilson in the Boston and Philadelphia collections previously
    referred to, gave a mean vertical diameter of 5.55 inches.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Four
    Mound-builder <span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>crania measured by the same investigation gave precisely
    the same result, while the remaining measurements varied from each
    other but slightly. In confirmation of this result it is worthy of
    notice that the mean vertical diameter of the twenty-one mound and
    stone grave crania from Tennessee varied from that of the Mexican
    crania by only one one-hundredth of an inch (5.56).</p>

  <p>When Dr. Morton began his investigations, he was disposed to recognize
    the existence of distinct races, represented by the dolichocephalic
    and brachycephalic crania of Peru.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> But in later years, and at
    a period subsequent to the issue of his justly celebrated work,
    he concluded that the Peruvian elongated head was the product of
    artificial compression and not the distinguishing mark of an ancient
    race which long antedated the Incas.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Prof. Wilson has thoroughly
    discussed this subject, and from a series of investigations, conducted
    on a much more extensive scale than those of Dr. Morton, he has
    shown conclusively that the distinguished craniologist was quite
    mistaken as to the facts upon which he based his later views.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
    Much valuable information was afforded Prof. Wilson by the researches
    and collections of John H. Blake, Esq., made during that gentleman’s
    residence in Peru, as well as the extensive collection of Dr. J. C.
    Warren of Boston. Prof. Wilson points out the essential difference
    between the compressed and the naturally dolichocephalic cranium in
    these words: “Few who have had extensive opportunities of minutely
    examining and comparing normal and artificially formed crania, will,
    I think, be prepared to dispute the fact that the latter are rarely,
    if ever, symmetrical. The application of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>pressure on the head of the
    living child can easily be made to change its natural contour, but it
    cannot give to its artificial proportions that harmonious repetition
    of corresponding developments on opposite sides which may be assumed
    as the normal condition of the unmodified cranium. But in so extreme
    a case as the conversion of a brachycephalic head averaging about 6.3
    inches longitudinal diameter by 5.3 inches parietal diameter into a
    dolichocephalic head of 7.3 by 4.9 inches diameter, the retention
    of anything like the normal symmetrical proportions is impossible.
    Yet the dolichocephalic Peruvian crania present no such abnormal
    irregularities as could give plausibility to the theory of their form
    being an artificial one, while peculiarities in the facial proportions
    confirm the idea that it is of ethnic origin and not the product
    of deformation.” Besides these differences there are peculiarities
    of a structural nature sufficient in themselves to distinguish the
    Peruvian long from the short crania. The former is small, narrow and
    decidedly long; the forehead is low and retreating, and two-thirds
    of the brain-cavity lies behind the occipital foramen. The superior
    maxillary is protruding and holds the incisor teeth obliquely. The
    weight of the bony structure also exceeds that in the brachycephalic.
    Though both classes are found artificially compressed, yet they are
    always distinguishable from each other. One of the best illustrations
    of this fact, and one already used by Prof. Wilson, is afforded in
    contrasting two dolichocephalic crania, both obtained by Mr. Blake
    in his explorations of the ancient cemeteries of Arica and Atacama.
    Both are evidently of children; one is in its normal condition,
    symmetrical, and when viewed from above presents the outlines of a
    graceful oval form, while the other was subjected to such compression
    as to throw the volume of the brain backward and to greatly deform the
    frontal bone.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> A slight tendency to assume the dog-shaped head of
    the Chinooks of the Columbia River is manifest, where deformation is
    carried to such an extent as to produce monstrosities. However, even
    then, the normal brachycephalic type of skull of the Chinooks is not
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>transformed to the dolichocephalic, since the base of the cranium
    remains comparatively unaffected while distension takes place in a
    posterior and upward direction. Mr. Squier in his <cite>Peru</cite> (p. 580,
    Appendix), has shown that circular compression produces a symmetrical
    effect in the same direction.</p>

  <p>The custom of artificially flattening the head has, upon investigation,
    been shown not to be peculiar alone to the aborigines of America,
    but to have been practised by many of the semi-civilized peoples of
    antiquity in different parts of Europe and Asia. Hippocrates, in his
    treatise <cite>De Aëre, Aquis, et Locis</cite>, has described this savage
    practice among a people whom he calls <i>Machrocephali</i>, supposed
    to have inhabited the region near the Palus Mæotis, in the vicinity of
    the Caucasus. He says, “The custom stood thus: as soon as the child was
    born, they immediately fashioned its soft and tender head with their
    hands, and by the use of bandages and proper arts, forced it to grow
    lengthwise, by which the spherical figure of the head was prevented
    and the length increased.” Strabo refers to a people occupying a
    portion of Western Asia, who were addicted to the same custom and
    had foreheads projecting beyond their beards.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Pliny places them
    in Asia Minor,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> while Pomponius Mela places the Machrocephali on
    the Bosphorus.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Blumenbach has figured in his first decade, a
    compressed skull obtained by him from Russia and probably originally
    from one of the tumuli of the Crimean Bosphorus, where it is supposed
    to have been exhumed during the Russian occupation. In 1843, Rathke
    figured and described in Müller’s <cite>Archiv für Anatomie</cite>, another
    example of the compressed human crania, obtained from an ancient
    grave near Kertsch in the Crimea. In 1820, Count August von Brenner
    obtained on his estate at Fuersbrunn near Grafenegg in Austria, a
    skull of similar characteristics. This was, upon examination, decided
    to have belonged to an Avarian Hun. Prof. Retzius described it in
    the <cite>Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Stockholm in
    1844</cite>, adducing arguments to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>strengthen that supposition. Dr.
    Tschudi, however, conceived the idea that it might have been a Peruvian
    skull which had been brought to Europe as a curiosity during the
    reign of Charles V. and afterwards thrown aside. His communication
    appeared in Müller’s <cite>Archiv für Anatomie</cite>. The opinion of the
    learned traveller was, however, subsequently reversed by the discovery
    at Atzgersdorf, near Vienna, of another and similar cranium. More
    recently others have come to light at the Village of St. Roman in
    Savoy, and in the Valley of the Doubs near Mandense. Dr. Fitzinger has
    probably investigated this subject with more thoroughness than any
    other writer, and has shown in his articles in the <cite>Transactions of
    the Imperial Academy of Vienna</cite>, that this custom was native to the
    Scythian region in the vicinity of the Mœtian Moor, and prevailed in
    the Caucasus and along the shores of the Black and Caspian seas and the
    Bosphorus. Among the most interesting relics cited as sustaining his
    views is an ancient medal struck in commemoration of the destruction
    of Aquileia by Attila the Hun in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 452, and bearing the
    bust of that “Scourge of God.” The head represented in profile is of
    precisely the same shape as those of the other Avir skulls, having a
    flattened form in a vertical and oblique direction. Thierry in his
    <cite>Attila</cite> has traced the origin of the custom of flattening the
    skull, to the Huns, who, descending from their home upon the steppes of
    Northern Asia, left their remains upon many a field in Europe. One of
    these deformed skulls was discovered in 1856 by J. Hudson Barclay, in
    a large cavern near the Damascus Gate at Jerusalem. The skeleton was
    of unusually large size and decayed, but the skull, which was pretty
    well-preserved, was brought to this country and is preserved in the
    collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Dr.
    J. Atkinson Meigs concluded, upon careful examination, that its occiput
    had been flattened by pressure during childhood. The testimony of Dr.
    Tschudi, rendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> undesignedly, amounts to the best of evidence of the
    transition of this custom from the eastern shores of Asia to Peru, and
    this isolated instance has been strengthened beyond question or doubt
    by the abundant proof which has been brought to light since attention
    was directed to the subject.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

  <p>In referring to the methods by which artificial compression was
    brought about in America, Prof. Wilson remarks: “Trifling as it may
    appear, it is not without interest to have the fact brought under our
    notice by the disclosures of ancient barrows and cysts, that the same
    practice of nursing the child and carrying it about, bound to a flat
    cradle-board, prevailed in Britain and the North of Europe long before
    the first notices of written history reveal the presence of man beyond
    the Baltic or the English Channel, and that in all probability the
    same custom prevailed continuously from the shores of the German Ocean
    to Behring Straits.”<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Dr. L. A. Gosse testifies to the prevalence
    of the same custom among the Caledonians and Scandinavians of the
    earliest times,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and Dr. Thurman has treated the same peculiarity
    of the early Anglo-Saxon.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> It is a matter of no little surprise
    to the inquirer in this field to learn that this system of skull
    distortion introduced into Southern Europe by the Asiatic hordes which
    overran it in the fifth century has been perpetuated, though somewhat
    modified, and at present is in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>vogue in the south of France.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
    The distinguished Dr. Foville, in charge of the Asylum for Insane
    in the Department Seine-Inférieure and Charenton, has figured this
    process in his work on the <cite>Anatomy of the Nervous System</cite>, as
    well as a number of skulls which have striking Peruvian resemblances.
    The artificial form in this case is produced by the use of peculiar
    head-dresses or bandages.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> The Egyptians placed a pillow under the
    neck and not for the head; hence the elongated crania characteristic of
    the race, and it is not a little remarkable that the Feejee Islanders
    have the same custom at the present day. The Kankas of the Sandwich
    Islands produce the flattened occiput by supporting the infant’s head
    always in the palm of the hand.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> The South Sea Islanders have a
    flattened occiput, as Pickering describes it, projecting but slightly
    beyond the line of the neck.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Prof. Wilson comments upon this fact
    as follows: “Traces of purposed deformation of the head among the
    islanders of the Pacific, have an additional interest in their relation
    to one possible source of the South American population by Oceanic
    migration, suggested by philological and other independent evidence.
    But for our present purpose the peculiar value of these modified skulls
    lies in the disclosures of influences operating alike undesignedly,
    and with a well-defined purpose, in producing the very same cranial
    conformation among races occupying the British Islands in ages long
    anterior to earliest history, and among the savage tribes of America
    and the simple islanders of the Pacific in the present day.”<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> It
    is a well-known fact that flattening the skull has prevailed from the
    earliest times in most parts of the American Continent, especially on
    the Pacific coast. From the extreme north to Southern Peru, flattening
    the skulls was regarded as an artistic improvement on nature and was
    practised <span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>with a maternal solicitude, if we judge from the customs
    of the modern Chinooks, deserving of a higher aim. More centrally
    and toward the Atlantic border the custom was not so carefully and
    generally practised, unless we may except the case of the Natchez, who
    carried it to almost the extreme reached at present by the Columbia
    River tribes. The object of this strange transformation is believed
    to have been twofold, “to give,” as Torquemada supposes, in referring
    to the Peruvians, “a fierce appearance in war,” and to obtain the
    mark of a royal and dominant race, a fashion which seems to have
    been transmitted without a variation, from its Mongol source. The
    Chinooks consider it the mark of superiority, and will not permit the
    tribes subject to them to practise it. Mr. Paul Cane, has illustrated
    this subject with drawings made during his visit to the Columbia
    and Vancouver’s Island, while Dr. Pickering, Mr. Hale and others,
    have described the hideous and beastly aspect of the singular people
    practising the deformation. Skull flattening among the American tribes
    may be classified as intentional and unintentional. To the class of
    intentionally <span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>flattened skulls we may assign those of the twenty or
    more tribes of the North-west coast, the Natchez, the ancient Mayas,
    the Peruvians, and some of the more central and eastern South American
    tribes. The North-western flatheads subject the head of a child during
    the first eight or ten months of its life to pressure produced by means
    of a cradle or cradle-board, provided with a board which rests upon
    the forehead and tied down upon it by means of cords extending to the
    foot of the cradle, while the other end is connected to the head of the
    cradle with a hingelike attachment.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Chinooks (Flat-Heads), after Catlin.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The Natchez produced the artificial form by bandaging the infant’s head
    to a well-cushioned cradle-board by means of strips of deer-skin.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
    The Caribs bandaged the head with pieces of wool, and gave it a very
    quadrangular shape. The Choctaws produced artificial compression by
    means of a bag of sand.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> The unintentional flattening of the
    skull arose from the quite general use of the cradle-board without
    any board for pressure, or the custom common among many American
    tribes of the mother suckling the child over her shoulder, a practice
    widely prevalent in Africa and among savage nations. In the former
    instance it is but reasonable to suppose that the form of a tender and
    pliable skull would be modified more or less by the shape of the hard
    cradle-board, and by the position in which it was placed upon its rest.
    This fact accounts for the slight occipital compression of the mound
    skulls and also for the irregularity of the flattening in many cases.
    The latter process, that of nursing the child from its position on the
    shoulder or back would no doubt subject the head to a slight pressure,
    perhaps in most cases in a lateral direction.</p>

  <p>The general prevalence of the unnatural custom of flattening the skull
    on the eastern border-land of Europe and among the numerous tribes of
    the western coast of America, together with its presence in Polynesia
    as a connecting link, we think justifies us in concluding that it
    originated among the wild hordes of the northern steppes of Asia, from
    which centre it spread in lines of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>radiation until it reached the
    remote localities in which recent research has found it.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> This fact
    is suggestive of a remote intercourse between peoples separated by seas
    and mountains, if it does not serve as an argument for the unity and
    common origin of the human family.</p>

  <p>A careful examination of the remains of the pre-historic races other
    than the measurement of crania has contributed largely to our fund of
    information concerning their life and habits. Science has rendered us
    pretty familiar with some of the diseases to which they were subject.
    Dr. Farquharson has described a singular manifestation of disease of
    the cervical vertebræ, shown in a peculiar roughening of the articular
    surfaces, and also by a true or bony anchylosis of these points. He
    concludes that the people of the mounds must have been possessed of a
    considerable degree of civilization and facilities for the care of the
    sick during a long period, in order to have effected the cure which
    the condition of the bones indicate had taken place.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> One of the
    most alarming discoveries, however, is that which apparently shows
    the general prevalence of syphilis. That this loathsome disease was
    common <span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>among the various tribes of Equinoctial America is attested to
    by the discoverers and their successors, and has been much commented
    upon, and held by some authors to have been of American origin. The
    most recent supporter of this view is Professor Jones, to whom we have
    already referred.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> He found in most of the mounds which he explored
    in Tennessee bones bearing syphilitic nodes, and believes them to be
    the oldest traces of the disease in existence. Dr. Farquharson made
    similar discoveries in the Iowa and Illinois mounds. Prof. Putnam,
    however, attributes the nodes to other diseases. That flattening of the
    leg-bone or tibia, peculiar to pre-historic man in Europe, and perhaps
    the result of rugged exertion in climbing mountains and traversing
    the country with that rapidity which the chase required where the
    horse is wanting, is more noticeable in the remains of some of the
    Mound-builders than in any other people. This peculiarity of the tibia
    called platycnemism, is probably a provision of nature, securing a
    firmer and better defined process upon which the muscles of the leg
    could fasten themselves, and its prominence among the people of the
    mounds indicates the possession of great pedestrian powers.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

  <p>The singular custom of perforating the skull after death (and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>possibly
    during life) is shown to have been in vogue by the discovery of a
    number of crania at the River Rouge Mound in Michigan with artificial
    apertures. No light as yet has been thrown upon the significance
    of this strange practice.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The nearest approach to the natural
    condition and characteristic physiognomy of the pre-historic
    inhabitants of this continent, is observable in the Peruvian mummies
    collected in latitude 18° 30´ S., on the shore of the Bay of Chacota,
    near Arica, by Mr. Blake, and transferred by him to Boston. Many
    others have since been exhumed, and though embalmed and buried in a
    climate which preserves the brightest colors of the garments with which
    they were enshrouded, still the shrivelled condition of the corpses
    furnishes us the assurance that their type of features can never be
    truly recovered from nature. Dr. Morton has figured the head of one
    of these mummies in Plate I of the <cite>Crania Americana</cite>, from
    which the physiognomy may be partially restored by the aid of a vivid
    imagination. Notwithstanding the temptation which presents itself, and
    one which has been sufficiently indulged already, it would certainly
    be idle to speculate as to what that type might have been. However,
    one feature of the Peruvian mummies has been preserved true to life,
    and is of the greatest value in determining ethnic relations. The
    silicious sand and marl of the plain southward of Arica, where the
    most remarkable cemeteries are situated, is slightly impregnated with
    common salt as well as nitrate and sulphate of soda. These conditions,
    together with the dry atmosphere rivalling that of Egypt, and in which
    fleshy matter dries without putrefaction, the human hair has been
    perfectly preserved, and comes to us as one of the best evidences of
    the diversity of the American races yet produced. In general it is a
    lightish brown, and of a fineness of texture which equals that of the
    Anglo-Saxon race.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
    Straight, coarse, black hair is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>universally
    characteristic of the Red Indians, and is known to be one of the last
    marks of race to disappear in intermarriage with Europeans. The ancient
    Peruvians appear, from numerous examples of hair found in their tombs,
    to have been an auburn-haired race. Garcilasso, who had an opportunity
    of seeing the body of the king Viracocha, describes the hair of that
    monarch as snow-white.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Haywood has described the discovery at
    the beginning of this century of three mummies in a cave on the south
    side of the Cumberland River, near the dividing line of Smith and
    Wilson Counties in Tennessee. They were buried in baskets, as Humboldt
    has described some of the Peruvians to bury, and the color of their
    skin was said to be fair and white, and their hair auburn and of a
    fine texture.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The same author refers to several instances of the
    discovery of mummies in the limestone and saltpetre caves of Tennessee
    with light yellowish hair.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Prof. Jones supposes that the light
    color of these so-called mummies of Tennessee and Kentucky was due to
    the action of lime and saltpetre.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

  <p>We have every reason to believe that the men of the mounds were
    capable of executing in sculptures reliable representations of
    animate objects. The perfection of the stone carvings, as well as the
    terra-cotta moulded figures of animals and birds obtained from the
    mounds, have excited the wonder and admiration of their discoverers.
    It was evidently a favorite pastime for those primitive artists to
    reproduce the human features, for effigies and masks have often been
    exhumed together with other sculptures. The perfection of the animal
    representations furnish us the assurance that their sculptures of the
    human face were equally true to nature.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The accompanying figures
    of sculpture <span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>and masks together with those found in the sculpture
    of the Mayas and Nahuas, shown in a future chapter, furnish us with
    a twofold argument: first, that an American type of physiognomy as
    such did not exist; that, upon the contrary, it was as variable
    and diversified as can now be found among the peoples <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>of Europe or
    elsewhere; second, that a strong resemblance between some of the
    sculptures of the mounds and those of Mexico exist. It is a remarkable
    fact that those of Palenque furnish the most striking likeness to
    those of the Mississippi Valley.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> There is, perhaps, no means of
    ascertaining of what color the pre-historic Americans were, certainly
    not of the Mound-builders; but judging from the great variety of tints
    and shades that prevail among the wild tribes of North America alone,
    we may conclude that no argument in favor of an <em>American</em> race
    can be based upon color.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

  <p>The Menominees, sometimes called the “White Indians,” formerly occupied
    the region bordering on Lake Michigan, around Green Bay. The whiteness
    of these Indians, which is compared to that of white mulattoes, early
    attracted the attention of the Jesuit missionaries, and has often been
    commented upon by travellers.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> While it is true that hybridity
    has done much to lighten the color of many of the tribes, still the
    peculiarity of the complexion of this people has been marked from the
    first time a European encountered them. Almost every shade, from the
    ash color of the Menominees, through the cinnamon red, copper and
    bronze tints, may be found among the tribes formerly occupying the
    territory east of the Mississippi—the remnants of some of which are now
    in the Indian Territory and others in the North-west—until we reach
    the dark-skinned Kaws of Kansas, who are nearly as black as the negro.
    The Indians in Mexico are known as the “black people,” an appellation
    designed to be <span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>descriptive of their color. Viollet le Duc is of the
    opinion that the builders of the great remains in Southern Mexico
    and Yucatan belonged to two different branches of the human family,
    a light-skinned and dark-skinned race respectively.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The variety
    of complexion is as great in South America as among the tribes of the
    northern portion of the continent.</p>

  <p>Probably one of the most incontrovertible arguments against American
    ethnic unity is that which rests upon the unparalleled diversity of
    language which meets the philologist everywhere. The monosyllable and
    the most remarkable polysyllables known to the linguist; synthetic and
    analytic families of speech, simplicity and complexity of expression,
    all seem to have sprung up and developed into permanent and in some
    cases beautiful and grammatical systems side by side with each other
    until the Babel of the Pentateuch is realized in the indescribable
    confusion of tongues. The actual number of American languages and
    dialects is as yet unascertained, but is estimated at nearly thirteen
    hundred, six hundred of which Mr. Bancroft has classified in his third
    volume of the <cite>Native Races of the Pacific States</cite>. It is true
    that the American languages present a few features quite peculiar to
    themselves (which will be treated hereafter), but as language is never
    constant, is not a pyramid with its unchanging architectural plan, but
    is a plant which passes through such transitions in the process of its
    growth as to lose entirely some of the elements which it possessed
    at first, so we may as reasonably expect that in the course of time
    certain peculiarities incident to certain climatic conditions, certain
    phases of nature and certain types of civilization, should develop
    themselves as distinguishing features of the speech of the continent.
    The very fact that language is unstable—is a matter of growth—renders
    the argument that these peculiarities indicate unity of the American
    race valueless; while, on the other hand, the fact that here we have
    a greater number and variety of languages than is to be found in any
    of the other grand divisions of the earth, is strong evidence of a
    diversity more radical than that which simply arises <span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>from tribal
    affiliations. In view of the wide differences existing between the
    native Americans themselves in every feature which admits of being
    subjected to a scientific test, we are forced to the conclusion, solely
    resting on the evidence in the case, that the theory of American ethnic
    unity is a delusion, an infatuating theory which served only to blind
    its advocates as to the plain facts, and led them into grave errors
    which will become all the more palpable as scientific investigation
    progresses.</p>

  <p>As yet no substantial reason for considering the ancient occupant
    of this continent as peculiar in himself, and as unlike the rest
    of mankind, has been set forth. Nothing in the American’s physical
    organization points to an origin different from that to which each of
    the species of the <i>genus homo</i> may be assigned. Whatever truth
    there may be in the diverse origin of the black and white race, the
    separate creation theory, in so far as it maintains that the Creator
    originated upon the soil of this continent a peculiar and separate
    race of men, must in the eyes of this age of criticism lack evidence,
    and be assigned to its place with thousands of others which from time
    immemorial have been contributing to the construction of a foundation
    reef which will ultimately rise like a bold headland above the dark
    waters of uncertainty into the realm of truth.</p>

  <p>A few students of American Anthropology have solved the question of
    the origin of the ancient population upon the hypothesis of its having
    developed from a lower order in the animal kingdom, itself indigenous
    to the Western Continent. One of the most distinguished representatives
    of this school, perhaps, is Frederick von Hellwald of Vienna, who
    states his views as follows: “I am unable to give in my adhesion to the
    theory which assumes that the original seat of the human races must be
    sought in higher Asia or somewhere else, whence mankind are supposed to
    have spread themselves gradually over the whole globe; an assumption
    which is contradicted in the most decisive manner by the peopling of
    the new world. It is impossible to enter here into all the hypotheses
    which have been framed for the explanation of a fact so perplexing to
    the Biblical students of the sixteenth century, and of course later
    times; it is enough <span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>to say that thus far not one of them have been
    found to correspond even approximately to the demands of science, and
    that theory is probably in every point of view the most tenable and
    exact which assumes that man, like the plant, a mundane being, made
    his appearance generally upon earth when our planet had reached that
    stage of its development which unites in itself the conditions of man’s
    existence. In conformity with this view, I regard the American as an
    Autochthon.”<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> This subject resolves itself into two questions:
    (1) Is the origin of the human race by the processes of development
    from a lower order of animal an ascertained fact? (2) If so, does
    the American continent furnish any species of ape or any known fauna
    from which man could have developed? It is taken for granted that
    the reader is fully familiar with Darwinism (the origin of species
    by means of natural selection, the joint result of the independent
    researches of Darwin and Wallace) and Lamarckism (the theory of man’s
    descent from the ape),<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> both of which have been so enthusiastically
    advocated by Spencer, Huxley, Hæckel and many others. Their works and
    the magnificent array of facts which their patient researches have
    accumulated command our admiration, even if full assent cannot be given
    to all their conclusions.</p>

  <p>The first question: <em>Is the origin of the human race by the processes
    of development from a lower order of animal an ascertained fact?</em>
    would at first seem to require a lengthy discussion at our hands. But
    in a special work on a subject altogether foreign to the question,
    such a discussion would certainly be out of place. Even if this were
    not true, the above question as stated requires no discussion. We
    believe that no advocate of the hypothesis of evolution could be found
    so sanguine or so unguarded, who would come forward and answer the
    question in the affirmative. On the contrary, we believe the question
    would call forth an honest negative from the great body of scientists
    who hold to the hypothesis of evolution. Obstinacy <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>alone could deny
    that the groups of facts which have been brought to our knowledge, the
    occasional well-marked transitional forms<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> which are turning up,
    the unquestionable tendency in species to vary, and possibly of their
    varieties slowly to form new species under modified surroundings, point
    to a principle, a law in nature, which may be characterized as the law
    of development or evolution. But on the other hand, the hypothesis
    that such a law exists, or, if you please, the fact that it exists,
    does not imply that it is <em>universal in its application</em> or that
    it has <em>extended through all the realm of nature</em>. Indeed, pure
    justice to the advocates of the hypothesis requires the statement that
    they have never made such a claim.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The fact that such eminent
    scientists as Mivart and Wallace deny the development of man from a
    lower order, is sufficient evidence that the hypothesis in its widest
    bearing is not accepted by all, much less is an ascertained “fact.” It
    appears, therefore, that the first question being unsettled, and as yet
    incapable of solution, the argument turns upon the second question:
    <em>Does the American Continent furnish any species of ape or any known
    fauna from which man could have developed?</em> Before answering the
    question in the light of present knowledge, it will be of interest to
    note the reply made by the late Professor Joseph Henry to the view of
    Frederick von Hellwald, quoted on a preceding page. His estimate of
    the probabilities of man developing from the lower orders of animals
    in more than one locality on the globe is expressed as follows:
    “The spontaneous generation of either plants or animals, although a
    legitimate subject of scientific inquiry, is as yet an unverified
    hypothesis. If, however, we assume the fact that a living being will
    be spontaneously produced when all the physical conditions necessary
    to its existence are present, we must allow that in the case of man,
    with his complex and refined organization, the fortuitous assembly of
    the multiform conditions <span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>required for his appearance would be extremely
    rare, and from the doctrine of probabilities could scarcely occur more
    than at one time and in one place on our planet; and further, that
    this place would most probably be somewhere in the northern temperate
    zone. Again, the Caucasian variety of man presents the highest physical
    development of the human family; and as we depart either to the north
    or south, from the latitude assumed as the origin of the human race
    in Asia, we meet with a lower and lower type until at the north we
    encounter the Esquimaux, and at the south the Bosjesman and the Tierra
    Fuegian. The derivation of these varieties from the original stock
    is philosophically explained on the principle of the variety in the
    offspring of the same parents, and the better adaptation and consequent
    chance of life of some of these to the new conditions of existence in
    a more northern or southern latitude.”<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> As a direct answer to the
    question, however, we can do nothing more than refer to the opinions of
    the two greatest advocates of evolution. “In order to form a judgment
    on this head,” says Mr. Darwin, “with reference to man, we must glance
    at the classification of the Simiadæ. This family is divided by almost
    all naturalists into the Catarhine group, or old world monkeys, all
    of which are characterized (as the name expresses) by the peculiar
    structure of the nostrils, and by having four pre-molars in each jaw;
    and into the Platyrhine group or new world monkeys (including two very
    distinct sub-groups), all of which are characterized by differently
    constructed nostrils and by having six molars in each jaw. Some
    other small differences might be mentioned. Now man unquestionably
    belongs, in his dentition, in the structure of his nostrils, and in
    some other respects, to the Catarhine or old world division; nor does
    he resemble the Platyrhines more closely than the Catarhines in any
    characters, excepting in a few of not much importance and apparently
    of an adaptive nature. Therefore, it would be against all probability
    to suppose that some ancient new world species had varied, and had
    thus produced a man-like creature with all the distinctive characters
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>proper to the old world division, losing at the same time all its own
    distinctive characters. There can, consequently, hardly be a doubt
    that man is an offshoot from the old world Simian stem, and that under
    a genealogical point of view he must be classed with the Catarhine
    division.”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Such was Mr. Darwin’s opinion in 1871; and that the
    views of evolutionists have not changed since that time as to this
    question, we call attention to the words of the distinguished Professor
    Hæckel in his <cite>History of Creation</cite>, which are as follows:
    “Probably America was first peopled from North-eastern Asia by the same
    tribe of Mongols from whom the Polar men (Hyperboreans and Esquimaux)
    have also branched. This tribe first spread in North America, and from
    thence migrated over the isthmus of Central America down to South
    America, at the extreme south of which the species degenerated very
    much by adaptation to the very unfavorable conditions of existence.
    But it is also possible that Mongols and Polynesians emigrated from
    the west and mixed with the former tribe. In any case the aborigines
    of America came over from the old world, and did not, as some suppose,
    in any way originate out of American apes. Catarhine or narrow-nosed
    apes never at any period existed in America.”<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The same argument
    holds good if it be ascertained that both man and apes developed from
    a common ancestor. With these authoritative utterances from the most
    celebrated representatives of the development school, we shall rest the
    fanciful hypothesis of the autochthonic origin of the ancient American
    population. Some who may not concur in our opinion as to the question
    of man’s development from lower animal forms, may be willing to admit
    that the Americans had an old world origin, which certainly, in the
    light of facts, is the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>only rational view.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> The unity of the human
    family is a theory, if not a fact, which is supported by a mass of
    testimony of the most diversified character. The habits and customs,
    the sympathies, the wants and fears, the simpler arts, as well as most
    bodily proportions, point to a relationship which finds its easiest
    explanation in a unity of origin. It is chiefly, however, in the ruder
    arts that this correspondence of style or type is observable. No better
    illustration of this offers itself than the similarity of form or
    forms in which flint arrow-heads are found in all parts of the world.
    It would be impossible for the most expert archæologists to assign a
    promiscuous collection of flint weapons to the various quarters of the
    globe from which they may have been gathered, simply on the ground of
    characteristic forms.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> The common methods of producing fire by
    means of friction, employed with but slight variation among people
    the most remotely separated,<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> is an inexplicable fact, except on
    the ground of an early community of residence or identical inventive
    genius. The universality of certain architectural forms such as the
    pyramid, and the singular fact that they have generally been used for
    places of sepulture, offers an argument in the same direction. The
    fact indicates either an early community of residence or identity of
    mental organization. The physical resemblances of all races in certain
    stable features which have never been known to change, indicate a
    divergence from a common centre—from one type. The slight differences
    in the type of skull which characterize some nations <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>from others, is
    no argument against original unity, since those peculiarities are
    certainly of more recent origin than the unknown events which at a
    remote period scattered men over the face of the earth.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Probably
    no difference between the races of men has been considered so essential
    as that of color, for none has furnished such reasonable ground for
    the views of polygenists as the marked contrast between the African
    and Caucasian types. Years ago the view that color was the result of
    tropical climate was abandoned,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> for the Eskimo and Lapps are
    almost as dark as many Africans, and their residence under the arctic
    circle has continued from a remote antiquity. Upon the other hand every
    variation in color, from the darkest to the lightest possible shades,
    exist among African tribes. The antiquity of the negro type as we
    now see it, is unquestionably considerable. As proof of this we have
    the oft-referred to argument from Egyptian paintings. In a temple at
    Beyt-el-Welee, in Nubia, constructed in the reign of Rameses II, is a
    painting which has been reproduced by Bonomi, in which a negro kneels
    at the feet of Sethos I, father and predecessor of Rameses II. All
    the peculiarities of the Negroid type are conspicuous; the blackness
    of the color, the thickness of lips, flatness of nose and woolliness
    of hair which pertain to the African of to-day are unquestionably
    present.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The painting representing this remarkable ethnic fact
    is 3200 years old, dating from 1400 years before Christ. The Duke of
    Argyll, on the authority of Prof. Lepsius, states that in earlier
    representations of the negro, referable to the “Twelfth Dynasty” or
    about 1900 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, the negro color is strongly marked, but not
    the negro features.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> It is a question whether this fact indicates
    a transition from one type to another, or whether the painting is a
    true representation of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>the Nubians, who are known not to have flat
    noses or projecting lips. It is supposed also that the unskillfulness
    of the artists may account for the absence of the typal lines.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
    Hieroglyphic writings have been found dating about 2000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.
    C.</span>, in which mention is made of the employment of Negro or black
    troops by an Egyptian king in the prosecution of a great war.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> At
    that remote period, when Abraham was almost the sole representative
    of the Jewish race, the negro type had multiplied and developed into
    strong tribes, which were important factors in the military contests of
    the oldest of powers—the Egyptian.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding this seeming permanence of type, it is well known that
    of all physical conditions, color is the most liable to change in
    every organism. Many animals under domestication change their color
    entirely.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> In our Southern States it was observed that house-slaves
    of the third generation presented quite a markedly different appearance
    from field slaves.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> This was owing as much, no doubt, to different
    food and different habits of life as to protection from the sun, though
    many different races have quite the same color while their habits of
    life are as different as well could be imagined. Of this class, the
    Eskimo, Chinese, and Fuegeans are examples. However, the fact that
    color is variable even in a slight degree, indicates that considerable
    if not radical changes might be brought about during a great length
    of time. Mr. Darwin has furnished the most rational solution of the
    question, which he describes briefly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>as follows: “Various facts which
    I have elsewhere given, prove that the color of the skin and hair is
    sometimes correlated in a surprising manner with a complete immunity
    from the action of certain vegetable poisons and from the attack
    of parasites. Hence it occurred to me that negroes and other dark
    races might have acquired their dark tints by the darker individuals
    escaping during a long series of generations from the deadly influence
    of the miasmas of their native countries.”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> This doctrine of the
    survival of only the fittest, while all the weaker and perhaps lighter
    complexioned individuals of a race gradually succumbed to the deadly
    influence of climate, no doubt will explain the origin of the dark
    races, known to enjoy a special immunity against yellow and other
    fevers.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> At all events, the formation of the distinctive features
    of races requires a great lapse of time. The geologist asks for time
    in which to account for the formation of strata, and the intelligent
    world now grants it to him without limit, and just as reasonably may
    the ethnologist ask for time in which to account for the formation of
    racial types.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Nor need the most literal interpreter of Genesis
    object to this demand on the ground of any conflict with the letter
    even of the historic narrative of the Pentateuch. The accepted
    chronology, based on Archbishop Usher’s interpretation, is no part of
    the text of Genesis. It is purely the product of his inadvertence and
    the blindness of many others of his school of Biblical chronologists.
    It is evident that the rules of interpretation applied to the tenth
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>chapter of Genesis, according to which the names of the descendants
    of Noah’s sons are taken to represent individuals only, cannot hold.
    The probabilities are that they represent considerable tribes or
    nations. This probability is an established fact in the sixteenth
    and subsequent verses. In the fifteenth verse we learn that Canaan,
    the grandson of Noah, “begat Sidon, his first-born, and Heth.” Here
    the writer seems to refer to individuals, but it is probable that he
    alludes even to the origin of tribes. In the sixteenth verse we are
    not left in doubt on the subject, for there he no longer speaks of
    individuals or generations but of the growth of nations. He immediately
    adds after the above quotation, “and [begat] the Jebusite, and the
    Amorite, and the Girgasite, and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the
    Sinite,” etc., etc.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> The account makes no pretensions at chronology
    or at furnishing data for any system, and the constructions put upon
    its condensed account of the origin and growth of nations during an
    indefinite lapse of time by short-sighted interpreters, are unwarranted
    and certainly do injustice to the oldest of our histories. When we
    go back of the birth of Christ two thousand years—to the time of
    Abraham—this is as far as we can tread with certainty in the light of
    History. This period has been aptly designated by the Duke of Argyll
    as “Time absolute.” But when we go back of 2000 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, we are
    compelled to walk in a twilight glimmer, with only the dim rays from
    occasional cuneiform inscriptions, and the condensed accounts contained
    in Genesis, falling across our uncertain pathway. This period the above
    able writer has chosen to call “Time relative,” and the probabilities
    are that its measure is double if not treble that of the portion of
    “Time absolute” which precedes the Christian Era. An additional fact in
    this connection which strengthens the preceding is, that the three most
    ancient versions of the Pentateuch—the Hebrew, the Samaritan and the
    Septuagint—vary considerably in their statements as to the ages of many
    of the patriarchs at the birth of their sons. So wide is the difference
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>in this respect between the Hebrew and Septuagint versions that their
    chronologies cannot be reconciled at all, the latter allowing a period
    of eight hundred years more than the former from Adam to Abraham; such
    being the case, it is impossible to arrive at the time of the flood or
    the origin of the race. These contradictions in versions, however, do
    not in any way impeach the historic authority of the Pentateuch, since
    it is in no sense a chronology any more than it is a work on geographic
    or astronomic science. The known antiquity of Egypt and China, to say
    nothing of the facts revealed by geology concerning man’s antiquity,
    can never be reconciled with Usher’s system, which is in no sense the
    true chronology of any known version of the Pentateuch.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

  <p>In this chapter we have seen that there is nothing to indicate that the
    Americans owe their origin to a special act of creation, and further,
    if they originated by the process of development (for which there is no
    sufficient evidence), that it was not upon the American continent. We
    are supported in these conclusions by the most respectable writers on
    American Ethnology<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
    and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>Antiquities. That the American population
    is of old world origin there can be little doubt; but from whence it
    came, and to what particular people or peoples it owes its birth, is
    quite another question.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
    That view seems open to least objections
    which maintains that the Western Continent received its population at
    a comparatively early period in the history of the race, before the
    peoples of Western Europe and Eastern Asia had assumed their present
    national characteristics or fully developed their religious and social
    customs.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE most ancient civilization on this continent, judging from the
    combined testimony of tradition, records, and architectural remains,
    was that which grew up under the favorable climate and geographical
    surroundings which the Central American Region southward of the
    Isthmus of Tehuantepec afforded. The great Maya family with its
    numerous branches, each in time developing its own dialect if not its
    own peculiar language, at an early date fixed itself in the fertile
    valley of the River Usumasinta, and produced a civilization which was
    old and ripe when the Toltecs came in contact with it. Here in this
    picturesque valley region in Tabasco and Chiapas we may look for the
    cradle of American civilization. Under the shadow of the magnificent
    and mysterious ruins of Palenque a people grew to power who spread into
    Guatemala and Honduras, northward toward Anahuac and southward into
    Yucatan, and for a period of probably twenty-five centuries exercised a
    sway which, at one time, excited the envy and fear of its neighbors. We
    are fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> aware of the uncertainty which attaches itself to tradition
    in general, and of the caution with which it should be accepted in
    treating of the foundations of history; but still, with reference to
    the origin and growth of old world nations, nothing better offers
    itself in many instances than suspicious legends. The histories of the
    Egyptians, the Trojans, the Greeks, and of even ancient Rome rests on
    no surer footing. It is certain that while the legendary history of any
    nation may be confused, exaggerated, and besides full of breaks, still
    there are some main and fundamental facts out of which it has grown,
    and this we think is especially true of the new world traditions.
    Clavigero says: “The Chiapanese have been the first peoplers of the new
    world, if we give credit to their traditions. They say that Votan, the
    grandson of that respectable old man who built the great ark to save
    himself and family from the deluge, and one of those who undertook the
    building of that lofty edifice which was to reach up to heaven, went
    by express command of the Lord to people that land. They say also that
    the first people came from the quarter of the north, and that when they
    arrived at Soconusco, they separated, some going to inhabit the country
    of Nicaragua and others remaining in Chiapas.”<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The tradition
    of Votan, the founder of the Maya culture, though somewhat warped,
    probably by having passed through priestly hands, is nevertheless one
    of the most valuable pieces of information which we have concerning
    the ancient Americans. Without it our knowledge of the origin of the
    Mayas would be a hopeless blank, and the ruins of Palenque would be
    more a mystery than ever. According to this tradition, Votan came from
    the East, from Valum Chivim, by the way of Valum Votan, from across
    the sea, by divine command, to apportion the land of the new continent
    to seven families which he brought with him. It appears that he had
    been preceded in America by two others named Igh and Imox, if the
    researches of the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg can be relied upon. In
    the Tzendal calendar, Votan’s name appears as that of the third day,
    while Igh and Imox are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>the first and second respectively. If, as is
    supposed, the names represent the true succession of the Maya chiefs,
    there is some ground for the Abbé’s view.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> The doubtful portions of
    the tradition which may be interpolations are the ambiguous assertions
    that he saw the Tower of Babel, and was present at the building of
    Solomon’s temple. Probably the remains only of the former structure may
    be referred to.</p>

  <p>With these contradictions we have nothing to do, as they do not in any
    way affect the subsequent history of the Votanites, or interfere with
    the probability of their old world origin. To attempt to designate the
    point from which Votan started or the means by which he reached the new
    world, would be the height of folly. Votan is said to have made four
    journeys to the land of his nativity. His achievements in the new world
    were, however, as great as those of any of the heroes of antiquity. His
    great city was named “Nachan,” (city of the serpents), from his own
    race, which was named Chan, a serpent. This Nachan is unquestionably
    identified with Palenque. The date of his journey is placed at 1000
    years <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span><a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
    The kingdom of the serpents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
    flourished so rapidly that Votan founded three tributary monarchies
    whose capitals were Tulan, Mayapan, and Chiquimula.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> The former is
    supposed to have been situated about two leagues east of the town of
    Ococingo; Mayapan is well-known to have been the capital of Yucatan,
    and Chiquimula is thought to have been Copan in Honduras.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> One of
    the great works of this hero was the excavation of a tunnel or ‘snake
    hole’ from Zuqui to Tzequil. He also deposited a great treasure at
    Huehuetan, in Soconusco, which he left under the vigilant care of
    a guard, directed by one of the most honorable women of the land.
    Finally, he wrote a book in which he recorded his deeds and offered
    proof of his being a Chane (or serpent). This ancient document, which
    is claimed to have been written by one of Votan’s descendants, of the
    eighth or ninth generation and not by himself,<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> was in the Tzendal
    language, a dialect or branch of the Maya, spoken in Chiapas and around
    Palenque. Its history is, however, quite checkered, and the information
    which it contained comes very indirectly. For generations the Votanic
    document was scrupulously guarded by the people of Tacoaloya, in
    Soconusco, but was finally discovered by Francisco Nuñez de la Vega,
    Bishop of Chiapas. In the preamble of his <cite>Constituciones</cite>, §
    xxx,<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> he claims to have read this document, but it is probable
    that only a copy, still in the Tzendal language but written in Latin
    characters, had come into his possession.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> He fails to give
    any definite information from the document except the most general
    statements with reference to Votan’s place in the calendar, and his
    having seen the Tower of Babel, at which each people was given a new
    language. He states that he could have made more revelations of the
    history of Votan from this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>document but for bringing up the old
    idolatry of the people and perpetuating it. With the zeal of a true
    Vandal, the bishop committed the dangerous documents, together with
    the treasure which he claims Votan to have buried in the dark-house,
    to the flames in 1691. There seems to have been other copies, however,
    of this remarkable manuscript, for about the close of the eighteenth
    century, Dr. Paul Felix Cabrera was shown a document in the possession
    of Don Ramon de Ordoñez y Aguiar, a resident of Ciudad Real in Chiapas,
    which purported to be the Votanic memoir.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Ordoñez, at the time,
    was engaged upon the composition of his work on the “<cite>History of
    the Heaven and Earth</cite>.”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> It appears that Cabrera was admitted
    to the confidence of Ordoñez, and availed himself of a few facts
    communicated to him by the latter, which he supplemented by drawing
    from his imagination for the rest of his account.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Brasseur de
    Bourbourg accuses Cabrera of seriously misrepresenting Ordoñez and of
    warping his account.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> The following, which is Cabrera’s account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
    may be of interest to the reader: “He (Votan) states that he conducted
    seven families from Valum Votan to this continent and assigned lands
    to them; that he is the third of the Votans; that having determined to
    travel until he arrived at the root of Heaven, in order to discover
    his relations, the Culebras, and make himself known to them, he made
    four voyages to Chivim (which he expressed by repeating four times from
    Valum Votan to Valum Chivim, from Valum Chivim to Valum Votan); that
    he arrived in Spain, and that he went to Rome; that he saw the great
    house of God building; that he went by the road which his brethren,
    the Culebras, had bored; that he marked it, and that he passed by
    the houses of the thirteen Culebras. He relates that in returning
    from one of his voyages he found seven other families of the Tzequil
    nation who had joined the first inhabitants, and recognized in them
    the same origin as his own, that is, of the Culebras. He speaks of
    the place where they built the first town, which, from its founders,
    received the name of Tzequil; he affirms the having taught them
    refinement of manners in the use of the table, table-cloth, dishes,
    basins, cups, and napkins; they taught him the knowledge of God and
    of his worship; his first ideas of a king and of obedience to Him;
    that he was chosen captain of all those united families.” It is not
    necessary for us to point out the hand of the interpolator in this
    account; it is sufficiently apparent. However, its obnoxious prominence
    need not destroy our faith in the general facts of the account. The
    interpretation of the document we submit to the reader with the simple
    reminder that the symbol of life and power among the Central Americans
    and Mexicans has ever been a serpent, a fact which may have derived its
    significance from the meaning of the name of the Votanites together
    with the power attained by Palenque.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Votan’s followers were called
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>Tzequites by their predecessors, probably by the descendants of Igh
    and Imox, the signification of which term is ‘men with petticoats.’ The
    Tzendal traditions refer always to the city of Nachan as the capital
    of the kingdom of the Chanes or Serpents, and the most significant
    feature of the traditional names of this people is the fact that
    the name Culhua, applied by the Nahua nations and especially by the
    Toltecs to a powerful people who had preceeded them at the south, is
    the exact equivalent of Chanes; the same is true of Culhuacan.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
    The Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg obtained a copy of the fragmentary MS.
    of Ordoñez, which he informs us was written in two separate parts in
    quarto, at different times. The first or mythological part exists in
    a copy owned by the Abbé.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> The second or historical part, if ever
    written, has never reached the light, and from the description <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>of
    its contents found in the first part, we should think that the author
    might have made a rather imaginative historian.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> While some of
    the details of the Votanic tradition are not worthy of a moment’s
    consideration, it is quite certain that in the general facts we have
    a key to the origin of what all Americanists agree in pronouncing the
    oldest civilization on this continent, one which was gray and already
    declining when the Toltecs entered Mexico. There is not the slightest
    evidence that it originated in any other place than in Chiapas, where
    it is found, and extended itself into Guatemala, Yucatan, and possibly
    branched northward in a colony as remote as Culhuacan. Sr. Orozco y
    Berra has found fifteen languages or dialects to be related to the Maya
    language, a fact which indicates the age and extent of that remarkable
    civilization.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Sr. Orozco is convinced from linguistic and other
    researches, that the inhabitants of Cuba and others of the West India
    Islands were Mayas, and points out the intermediate location of Cuba
    between Florida and Yucatan. He thinks the earliest home of the Mayas
    on this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>continent was on the Atlantic coast of the United States, from
    whence they emigrated to Cuba and thence to Yucatan.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Though we are
    not fully satisfied that the Mayas ever occupied Florida, it is quite
    likely that the islands of the Gulf were inhabited by them at an early
    day. The culture hero Votan is a mystery, and to arrive at his true
    character or office is simply an impossibility. For those disposed to
    speculate, there is abundant opportunity.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> The most interesting
    traditionary history which has been discovered is that of the Quichés
    of Guatemala. By the name Quiché, in this immediate connection, we do
    not mean to speak of that people after they became amalgamated with
    the Nahua nations from Central Mexico, but as a branch of the great
    Maya monarchy, in all probability located at first at Tulha or Tula,
    which, it is believed, was situated near Ococingo. At first, we think,
    the Quichés developed their own institutions, dialects, etc., as one
    of the allied powers associated with the capital city Nachan, but
    gradually assumed an individuality which became distinctive, until a
    rivalry between the capital and its allied neighbor sprang up, which
    ultimately ended in the overthrow of the former. Sr. Pimentel, on the
    authority of an ancient author, states that the name Quiché was applied
    to the first empire of Palenque and signified <em>many trees</em>. It
    was employed by the “innumerable families of different nations which
    composed it, to symbolize its various branches.”<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> The tradition of
    their origin states that they came from the far East, across immense
    tracts of land and water; that in their former home they had multiplied
    considerably and lived without civilization, and with but few wants;
    they paid no tribute, spoke a common language, did not bow down to wood
    and stone, but lifting their eyes toward heaven, observed the will of
    their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>Creator, they attended with respect to the rising of the sun,
    and saluted with their invocations the Morning Star; with loving and
    obedient hearts they addressed their prayers to Heaven for the gift
    of offspring. “Hail, Creator and Maker! regard us, attend us. Heart
    of Heaven, Heart of the Earth, do not forsake us, do not leave us.
    God of Heaven and Earth, Heart of Heaven, Heart of Earth, consider
    our posterity always. Accord us repose, a glorious repose, peace and
    prosperity, justice, life and our being. Grant to us, O Hurakan,
    enlightened and fruitful, Thou who comprehendest all things great and
    small.”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> In the <cite>Popol Vuh</cite>, the sacred book of the Quichés,
    we are enabled to arrive more closely at the cosmogony and worship
    of that remarkable people.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> The reader may not be prepared for
    the irreconcilable contradictions and for the obscure and figurative
    language in which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>this work abounds; but with the remembrance that
    all nations of antiquity delighted in the use of figures, parabolic
    disguises and personifications under which the truth was couched, we
    may be able to profit by even the seeming foolishness and confusion
    of the Quiché record. The strange, wild poetry of the Quichés, can
    only be fully enjoyed by pursuing the unabridged accounts for which we
    regret we have not space.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> In the order of the Quiché creation, the
    heavens were first formed and their boundaries fixed by the Creator
    and Former, by whom all move and breathe, by whom all nations enjoy
    their wisdom and civilization. At first there was no man or animal
    or bird or fish or green herb—nothing but the firmament existed,
    the face of the earth was not yet to be seen, only the peaceful sea
    and the whole expanse of heaven. Silence pervaded all; not even the
    sea murmured; there was nothing but immobility and silence in the
    darkness—in the night.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> The Creator, the Former, the Dominator—the
    feathered serpent—those that engender, those that give being, moved
    upon the water as a glowing light. Their name is Gucumatz, heart of
    heaven—God. “Earth,” they said, and in an instant it was formed and
    rose like a vapor cloud; immediately the plains and mountains arose
    and the cypress and pine appeared. Then Gucumatz was filled with joy,
    and cried out, “Blessed be thy coming, O Heart of Heaven, Hurakan,
    thunderbolt!”<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Animals were next formed, but because they could
    not praise their Maker they were doomed to become objects of prey.
    Four creations of men then followed. The first man was made of clay,
    but he had no intelligence and he was consumed in the water. Upon a
    second trial a man and a woman were made of a sort of pith, but they
    too were unsatisfactory experiments; though they had life and peopled
    the earth, they were very inferior, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>living like beasts and forgetting
    the Heart of Heaven. The Creator then destroyed them with a flood of
    resin, allowing only a few to escape, that now exist as little apes
    in the woods. The persons of the Godhead, enveloped in the darkness
    which enshrouded a desolated world, counseled concerning the creation
    of a more perfect order, and as a result they formed four perfect men
    named: Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Agab, Mahucutah, and Iqi-Balam. These men
    were miraculously formed of white and yellow maize, and the Creator
    was content with his labors. “Verily, at last, were there found men
    worthy of their origin and their destiny; verily, at last, did the gods
    look upon beings who could see with their eyes and handle with their
    hands and understand with their hearts, grand of countenance and broad
    of limb, the four sires of our race stood up under the white rays of
    the morning star—sole light as yet of the primeval world—stood up and
    looked. Their great clear eyes swept rapidly over all; they saw the
    woods and rocks, the lakes and the sea, the mountains and the valleys,
    and the heavens that were above all; and they comprehended all and
    admired exceedingly. Then they returned thanks to those who had made
    the world and all therein was: we offer up our thanks, twice—yea,
    verily, thrice; we have received life, we speak, we walk, we taste, we
    hear and understand, we know both that which is near and that which
    is far off, we see all things, great and small, in all the heaven and
    earth. Thanks, then, Maker and Former, Father and Mother of our life,
    we have been created—we are.”<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> These four creatures were considered
    too perfect by the gods, and in order that their omniscience might be
    destroyed, they breathed a cloud of mist over their vision. To each of
    these men wives were made while they slept. A fourth creation seems to
    have taken place by which the ancestors of other races were formed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

  <p>The account which the <cite>Popol Vuh</cite> furnishes of the migrations of
    the ancient Quichés is somewhat confused, and it is scarcely possible
    to hope that the locations named should ever be fully identified.
    Their worship was at first purely spiritual. “Only they gazed up into
    heaven, not knowing what they had come so far to do.” In their original
    home, wherever that might have been, they grew weary of this kind of
    service—of watching for “the rising of the sun”—by which it seems they
    meant the coming of temporal power. The four men then forsook their
    abode and journeyed to Tulan-Zuiva, the seven caves or seven ravines.
    Here they found gods; to each of the four men a different deity was
    assigned. To Balam-Quitzé the god Tohil was given; to Balam-Agab the
    god Avilix; and to Mahucutah, the god Hacavitz; and though the fourth
    man Iqi-Balam also received a god, no special account is taken of him,
    since the latter of the four men left no progeny. The journey to Tulan
    is said to have been a very long one. Doubtless in this account we have
    an allusion to one of those modifications in religious notions which
    seems to have often attended a change of residence in early times. The
    abstract worship of the Creator is supplanted by the more material
    and ceremonial worship of intermediate deities (demi-gods). Tulan
    is described as a much colder climate than the eastern and tropical
    land which they had forsaken, and the god Tohil came to their relief
    by the creation of fire. But incessant rains, accompanied with hail,
    extinguished all their fires, which were again kindled repeatedly
    by the fire-god. Tulan was an unfavorable locality for permanent
    abode—rains, extreme cold, dampness, famine prevailed, and the peculiar
    misfortune of the confusion of tongues there befell them. No longer
    were the brother propagators of the race able to communicate with each
    other. “At Tulan there was as yet no sun,” is the significant but
    perplexing language of the narrative. At last Tulan, the mysterious
    land of the “seven-caves,” was forsaken, and under the leadership
    of Tohil the people began a migration which was attended with
    indescribable hardships and famine itself. Their way led through dense
    forests, over high mountains, a long sea passage, and by a rough and
    pebbly shore. We are, however, told that the sea was parted for their
    passage. Their tribulations were at an end when at last they arrived at
    a beautiful mountain, which they named after their god Hacavitz. Here
    they were informed that the sun would appear, and, as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span> consequence,
    the four progenitors of the race and all the people rejoiced. Here
    was everything beauteous and gladdening. The morning star shed forth
    a resplendent brightness, and the sun itself at last appeared, though
    then it had not the warmth which it possessed at a later day. Before
    the light of the sun, however, the gods Tohil, Avilix and Hacavitz,
    together with the tiger and lion and reptiles, were changed into stone.
    To interpret this paragraph, which is greatly condensed, is a difficult
    undertaking, still there are certain facts which seem to serve as the
    basis of intelligent speculation. The language is extremely figurative
    throughout the entire narrative, and especially so here. Their worship
    of the morning star at an early period seems to connect them with the
    Mediterranean peoples of the old world. The allusions to the sun not
    yet having come may be retrospective, indicating that the worship of
    the sun had not been adopted at that early day, or it may indicate
    that the period of national strength had not dawned. The fact that the
    morning star shone more brilliantly on Mt. Hacavitz than at Tulan (the
    seven caves), may mean either that the worship of the star was more
    splendidly celebrated, or it may have reference to an astronomical
    fact, that the star itself was more luminous, and furnish evidence in
    harmony with the statements of the narrative that Mt. Hacavitz was a
    more southern location than the tempestuous Tulan. The petrifaction
    of the three tribal gods may have been the result of an age of peace
    and prosperity which offered an opportunity for developing their
    cultus; or, upon the other hand, if the coming of the sun refers to
    the advent of a new religion, that which is known to have prevailed
    among the Nahuas, the old gods may have been sculptured in stone,
    that their national character and deeds might not be forgotten before
    the increasing importance of the new faith. There they instituted
    sacrifices of beasts to the three stone gods Tohil, Avilix and
    Hacavitz; they even drew blood from their own bodies and offered it
    to them. Finally, not content with these, the first four men, led by
    Balam-Quitzé, instituted human sacrifices. Captives were taken from
    neighboring tribes, kidnapping was practised extensively, until the
    hostility of their neighbors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span> broke forth into open war. The contest,
    however, resulted favorably to the Quichés, and the surrounding tribes
    became subject to the victorious power. In Hacavitz they composed
    a national song called the Kamucu (“we see”)—a memorial of their
    misfortunes in Tulan—a lament for the loss of so many of their people
    in that unfortunate locality. This loss is described as occasioned by a
    portion of their race being left behind, rather than as the result of
    the misfortunes which attended them there. At last, at the noon-day of
    their national glory, it came to pass that the ancestors of their race,
    Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Agab, Mahucutah and Iqi-Balam, died—the men who
    came from the east, from across the sea, died—and their remains were
    enveloped in a great bundle and preserved as memorials of the ancestors
    of the race.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Then the Quichés sang the sad Kamucu, and mourned the
    loss of their leaders and that portion of their race which they left
    behind them in Tulan.</p>

  <p>The definite location of Tulan is almost out of the question; it may
    only be conjectured. We have already stated, on the authority of
    Ordiñez, that there was a Tulan near Ococingo.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The Cakchiquel MS.,
    known only through the writings of Brasseur de Bourbourg, but evidently
    a document containing the same facts as those stated in the <cite>Popol
    Vuh</cite>, gives the following information concerning Tulan: “Four
    persons came from Tulan, from the direction of the rising sun—that is
    one Tulan. There is another Tulan in Xibalbay, and another where the
    sun sets, and it is there that we came; and in the direction of the
    setting sun there is another, where is the god; so that there are four
    Tulans; and it is where the sun sets that we came to Tulan, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>from the
    other side of the sea where this Tulan is; and it is there that we were
    conceived and begotten by our mothers and our fathers.”<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> From this
    it appears that two of these Tulans were not upon the continent at all;
    one in the east across the sea, the birthplace of the race; another
    an imaginary locality somewhere toward the region of the setting sun,
    where the deity dwells; another Tulan is pretty certainly located in
    Chiapas near the capital of Xibalba; with this place, however, they
    do not state that they had any relationship, but another Tulan where
    the sun sets is designated as the locality to which they came from
    across the sea. Mr. Bancroft confounds the Tulan of their misfortunes
    with that which was located near Xibalba; but this view is plainly
    wrong, since the climatic surroundings of the Chiapan Tulan are quite
    the opposite of those described as prevailing at that Tulan where
    fire was so necessary. In the Tulan to which they journeyed they
    suffered from cold, and their god Tohil, whom they received there,
    gave them fire. Señor Orozco y Berra quite positively identifies this
    Tulan with the Toltec capital Tollan, north of Anahuac, and certainly
    with reason.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> There their tongues were changed, there the Nahua
    language was encountered. No doubt that in the first period of the
    Toltec power in Tollan, the Maya-Quichés who had migrated northward
    from some locality in the Usumacinta region and intermingled with the
    Nahuas, sharing in their worship and appropriating certain elements of
    language, migrated southward to the elevated regions of Vera-Paz and
    founded a Quiché power in Guatemala.</p>

  <p>Upon the downfall of the Toltec monarchy in the eleventh century, no
    doubt many noble Toltec families forsook the unfortunate and fallen
    capital and founded in Guatemala the Quiché-Cakchiquel monarchy,
    composed of Maya and Toltec elements, which spread itself southward
    in colonies and branches into various parts of Central America, and
    flourished with such <span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>power and fame at the time of the Conquest. It
    is not the province of this work to take up the annals of this or any
    other people, but only to treat of their most primitive period. The
    gap in Quiché history between that which we have been treating and the
    period of the Annals is considerable, and no document has yet been
    discovered which will fill it with the wanting record. Mr. Bancroft
    has placed the annals within the reach of the English reader in his
    fifth volume. Mt. Hacavitz was the point at which the scattered tribes
    collected and formed the nucleus of the subsequently powerful monarchy
    in Guatemala of which Utatlan was the capital. The two places may
    have been identical. Several facts point to the early association of
    the ancestors of the Quichés with the Nahuas who subsequently figure
    so conspicuously as Toltecs and Aztecs. The tribes which migrated
    northward were called Yaqui (according to the <cite>Popol Vuh</cite>),
    and the name ethnographically has the same meaning as Nahuatl.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
    The Quichés applied the name to the inhabitants of Mexico. The god
    Tohil was called by the Yaqui tribes Yolcuat Quitzalcuat while the
    Quichés were in Tulan. Quetzalcoatl, of whom we shall speak more
    fully hereafter, was the greatest of the Nahua divinities.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The
    Aztecs and Toltecs as well as the Quichés came from the “Seven Caves,”
    that Tulan which seems to have been the early home of the two great
    families speaking radically different languages—the Maya and the Nahua.
    The statement so often met with that Tulan was across the sea is
    perplexing. Can we look for it upon some of the islands of the Gulf or
    Caribbean Sea? or are we to look upon the reference to the sea passage
    as an earlier event in the history of both peoples, which because of
    the lack of records has been confounded with some of the adventures
    of the march toward the northern Tulan, which was undertaken at least
    by the Mayas and possibly by the Nahuas from their common home in the
    Usumacinta valley? We are inclined, in the light of a large margin
    of testimony, to accept the latter view, and consider the Tulan of
    the Chiapan region to have been the early home of both peoples—the
    primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> one of the Mayas and the adopted one of the Nahuas—after
    leaving Hue Hue Tlappalan, the accidental centre to which in their
    wanderings they converged, and in which they met; here in an age of
    simpler manners they lived in the enjoyment of peace, preserving each
    their own institutions and language, though considerably influencing
    each other’s customs. The Tulan of this Central American region may
    have been confounded in name and characteristics with the original home
    of each race “across the sea.”</p>

  <p>The Quiché record furnishes us with the account of an epoch in the
    early Quiché history which we are justified in characterizing as
    their heroic period. It occupies the same place in their history as
    the Trojan war in the history of Greece. The tradition of the fall of
    Xibalba, the terror of its neighbors, the power which by its enemies
    was called infernal, is a heroic composition founded on a combination
    of events as mysterious and wonderful as those contained in the Iliad
    itself. To locate the events in their proper place, to assign them
    their true period, is attended with as many difficulties as attend the
    Homeric history. The authorities differ as to the proper chronologic
    order of the record. The <cite>Popol Vuh</cite>, both in the Ximinez and
    Brasseur editions, give the narrative to which we have reference
    immediately after the destruction of the men made of pith or wood—the
    result of the first creation. Mr. Bancroft is somewhat indifferent
    about the order and follows the narrative. Brasseur de Bourbourg,
    however, considers that chronologically the narrative follows the third
    creation, that of the four founders of the Quiché race.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> If we
    look upon the so-called creations as simply tribal origins and not as
    mythical accounts of the origin of man, there is room for the heroic
    period before the days of the four ancestors of the Quichés; but if,
    on the contrary, the two creations preceding that of Balam-Quitzé and
    his associates are mythical, are the legendary accounts of a fancied
    order in creation and not the origin of tribes, the view taken by the
    Abbé is the only one which can be accepted. The question cannot at
    present be definitely settled. If we resort to the latter view, that
    of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>Abbé, it is necessary for us to suppose that the long reign
    of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Agab, Mahucutah and Iqi-Balam is that of a
    line, a dynasty, and not of individuals—which is altogether probable.
    Brasseur supposes the time of which the tradition speaks to have been
    about fifteen centuries before the Spanish conquest, and thinks Copan
    was the capital of a province called Payaqui (“in the Yaqui,” which we
    have seen was the name of the Nahuas), and that this capital, otherwise
    known as Chiquimula, owed its origin to a warrior known as Balam, who
    introduced human sacrifices. His authority is the <cite>Isagoge Historico
    MS.</cite> cited by Pelaez, to whose work we have already referred.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
    To attempt to determine upon the time definitely would be a hopeless
    undertaking. The mysterious tradition with its confused statements and
    allegorical allusions we will attempt to condense into intelligible
    shape. This has already been accomplished by Mr. Bancroft, and his
    version greatly facilitates our efforts in the same direction.</p>

  <p>The second division of the <cite>Popol Vuh</cite> contains the account of
    two attempts at the overthrow of the great Xibalban monarchy, founded
    by Votan. The first of these proved unsuccessful and fatal to the
    enemies of the great power; the second, undertaken by the descendants
    of the defeated chieftains, resulted in the downfall of the empire
    of the Serpents or Votanites, and in the revenge of the death of
    the unsuccessful warriors. The account is provokingly figurative;
    different allies of each of the powers being spoken of as owls, wild
    beasts, rabbits, deer, rats, lice, ants, etc., a custom which has
    always prevailed among savage and semi-civilized nations. Savages of
    the forests are usually referred to as wild beasts in early tradition.
    Xibalba is so hated by its enemies that its usual title is the
    “infernal regions.”<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Torquemada refers to it as <em>hell</em>, and
    its king as the king of the “shades.”<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> The hatred was intense, and
    the worst <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>invectives were mild in the estimation of the enemies of
    the no doubt oppressive power. We have already given the account of
    creation in which Gucumatz (the Plumed Serpent) figured conspicuously.
    He, however, is seen to have acted at the word of Hurakan (“Heart of
    Heaven”). The closing paragraphs of the first division of the <cite>Popol
    Vuh</cite> give some of the exploits of the young heroes Hunahpu and
    Xbalanque, who figure as the defendants of the worship of the Heart of
    Heaven. A certain Vucub-Cakix, who assumed to be the sun and god of
    the people, and who in his pride offended the Heart of Heaven, fell at
    their avenging hands. His sons Zipacna and Cabrakan, whose pride was
    as offensive to Hurakan as had been their father’s, shared the same
    fate; though the brothers lost four hundred of their allies in the
    undertaking, by Zipanca toppling over a house upon them while they were
    rejoicing at his supposed death in a pit in which they had buried him.</p>

  <p>The second division of the account reverts to events which preceded
    those in the closing paragraphs of the first division by one or
    more generations. The exploits of the ancestors of the brothers are
    narrated. Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, grandparents of the sun and moon,
    had two sons, Hunhunahpu and Vukub Hunahpu. The former of these sons
    married, and to him were born also two sons, Hunbatz and Hunchouen,
    who grew up to be wise and skillful and great artists. With all
    these persons Hurakan, the Heart of Heaven, communicated through his
    messenger Voc. At last Hunhunahpu and Vukub Hunahpu undertook a journey
    toward Xibalba, playing ball as they went, by which we understand that
    they set out upon a march of conquest. Upon hearing of their approach,
    Hun Came and Vukub Came, kings of Xibalba, sent them a challenge to
    a game of ball by four messengers who were called owls. From the
    ball-ground of Nimxab Carchah (now the name of an Indian town in Vera
    Paz), they followed the messengers down the steep road to Xibalba,
    crossing rivers and ravines and a bloody stream. After arriving at
    the royal palace, and during the process of arranging for the contest
    in which their strength should be tried, they were so unfortunate as
    first to be made the subjects of ridicule for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span> whole court, then
    put to torture, and afterwards were cruelly and it seems treacherously
    murdered. The head of Hunhunahpu was hung upon a tree, which at once
    became overgrown with gourds so as to hide the head of the unfortunate
    chief. Notwithstanding the royal decree that no one should approach
    the tree, Xquiq, a virgin princess, a Xibalban, determined to taste
    its forbidden fruit, and in an hour of solitude was in the act of
    reaching forth to pluck it, when Hunhunahpu spat into her hand and she
    immaculately conceived. Her condition was discovered by her father, who
    delivered her to the owls, the royal messengers, to be put to death. By
    bribing her executioners she escaped and went to the dwelling of the
    old grandmother Xmucane, who upon the death of Hunhunahpu’s wife had
    taken charge of his sons, the youthful Hunbatz and Hunchouen. Xquiq,
    by miraculous performances, satisfied Xmucane that Hunhunahpu was the
    father of her unborn children, and was received into her home. The
    Xibalban virgin brought forth twin sons in the house of the enemies
    of her country. These she named Hunahpu and Xbalanque. From the very
    first their lot with their great-grandmother was a hard one. Their
    half-brothers Hunbatz and Hunchouen treated them harshly, but in time
    the twins revenged themselves by changing the former into monkeys, and
    succeeding to their artistic skill and musical fame.</p>

  <p>Various exploits of the twin brothers are narrated, chiefly—as we would
    interpret the figurative language—with the more savage tribes of the
    forests and mountains. From one of their captives whom they call a rat,
    they learned of the expedition of their father and uncle, and were
    brought into possession of their ball implements. The old ball-ground
    (probably battle-ground) of their fathers was resorted to by Hunahpu
    and Xbalanque, and when the Xibalban monarchs, Hun Came and Vukub Came,
    heard of their purposes, they were angered and sent a challenge to
    them as they had done to their ancestors. The message was delivered
    at the great-grandmother’s home, and the two chieftains, upon being
    acquainted with the news, returned to bid both mother and grandmother
    farewell. Before taking final leave, they planted in the centre of
    the house (probably the court) each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span> a cane, which was endowed with
    the singular attribute of revealing to the family the fortunes of
    each of the brothers. The life and fate of each cane was inseparably
    connected with that of Hunahpu and Xbalanque. On their route to Xibalba
    the bloody river was passed and a stream called Papuhya; but, more
    wise than their predecessors, they took cunning precautions not to be
    deceived and sacrificed by the Xibalban monarchs. For this purpose, it
    is said, they sent an animal called Xan before them, equipped with a
    hair from Hunahpu’s leg, with which he pricked the princes and by their
    exclamations learned their names. Thus they detected the artificial
    wooden men whom we are told deceived their ancestors and made them the
    objects of ridicule.</p>

  <p>By this strange personification we think we may understand that the
    father and the uncle of the two young heroes had treated with a couple
    of irresponsible Xibalbans who had been sent out to meet them, with
    the pretence that they were the kings, and when they had induced their
    enemies to enter the city, the true monarchs seized them and repudiated
    the action of the so-called wooden men, avowing no responsibility for
    their pledges. Hunahpu and Xbalanque avoided two other artifices of
    which their ancestors were the victims; one of these was a seat on a
    red-hot stone under the pretence that it was the seat of honor; the
    other was an ordeal in the “House of Gloom.”<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> The angry Xibalban
    kings then met them in a game of ball, but suffered a defeat. Hun Came
    and Vukub Came then requested the victors to give them four bouquets of
    flowers, which request was granted, the fortunate brothers themselves
    bearing them to the defeated kings. At their instance, however, the
    guards of the royal gardens committed Hunahpu and Xbalanque to the
    house of lances—the second of five ordeals common at Xibalba. Scarcely
    had this been done before a swarm of ants—allies of the brothers—came
    to their rescue, entered the royal gardens, bribed the lancers,
    released their leaders and punished the owls—guards of the Xibalban
    kings—by splitting their lips. The defeated <span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>monarchs began to realize
    the seriousness of the contest which was being waged against them.
    Hunahpu and Xbalanque were then subjected to ordeals in the houses of
    cold, of tigers, and of fire respectively, but without suffering harm.
    As we proceed, the account becomes more figurative than ever. In the
    next ordeal in the house of bats, we are told that Hunahpu’s head was
    cut off by the ruler of the bats, who, it seems, was recognized as of
    super-terrestrial origin. Strange to say, this violent proceeding did
    not prove fatal to Hunahpu; the animals assembled, came to the heroes’
    relief, and by the strategic skill of the turtle and rabbit, at a
    great game of ball, the brothers came out of all the Xibalban ordeals
    unharmed.</p>

  <p>The next act was designed as the beginning of the end of the great
    struggle. Xibalba had failed because the brutes were not its allies.
    The brothers were determined to show the haughty rival their personal
    greatness, and resorted to the use of their magical arts. After
    proper instructions to their sorcerers, Xulu and Pacam, Hunahpu and
    Xbalanque mounted a funeral pyre and endured a voluntary death. But
    their ashes and bones which were thrown into a river, rose instantly
    into life, assuming the shape of young men. Five days subsequent to
    this wonderful event they appeared in the form of man-fishes; and on
    the day following, the sorcery was complete, for the brothers now
    presented themselves in the form of “ragged old men, dancing, burning
    and restoring houses, killing and restoring each other to life, and
    performing other wonderful things. They were induced to exhibit their
    skill before the princes of Xibalba, killing and resuscitating the
    king’s dog, burning and restoring the royal palace. Then a man was
    made the subject of their art. Hunahpu was cut in pieces and brought
    to life by Xbalanque. Finally the monarchs of Xibalba wanted to
    experience personally the temporary death; Hun Came the highest was
    first killed, then Vukub Came, but life was not restored to them.”<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
    The twin sons of the unfortunate Xibalban virgin, an outcast from her
    home, triumphed, their father and uncle were avenged, the warlike
    Xibalbans—the fierce, frightful-looking, owl-like, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>faithless,
    hypocritical tyrants, black and white, and with painted faces, as they
    are described—were overthrown forever. The ancestors of the victorious
    chieftains were then deified and given places in the sun and moon;
    while their allies, the enemies of Xibalba, were made stars in the
    firmament.</p>

  <p>To interpret fully this figurative account requires further knowledge,
    which it is hoped ultimately may come to light. The beheading of
    Hunahpu in the house of bats may signify the loss of the most important
    division of his army; for when the “animals” came to his relief—by
    which we understand the less civilized tribes of the country—he
    obtained a victory. The closing paragraphs of the account indicate that
    a long and tiresome warfare brought the brothers repeated victories,
    but not the entire overthrow of Xibalba; and that stratagem was
    resorted to—a stratagem no more improbable or difficult to understand
    than that of the wooden horse said to have been used by the Greeks
    at Troy. The stratagem was at last successful, and Xibalba, of the
    Votanites—we suppose the empire of the Chanes—fell. The war seems to
    have been one of religion in part, for Hurakan, “Heart of Heaven,”
    inspired the contest, and Gucumatz, “the Plumed Serpent,” one of
    his associate though minor deities, was the god of Hunahpu and
    Xbalanque. The wicked Xibalbans were puffed up against the Heart of
    Heaven, would not accept the true faith, and hence their overthrow
    before the advancing power of a new religion.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> It is certain that
    the conquerors of Xibalba (which was no doubt Palenque) were near
    neighbors, who had been closely allied to the great power. Bancroft is
    of the opinion that they were the Tzequiles, who arrived during Votan’s
    absence and introduced new ideas of government and religion among
    his people.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Garcia Pelaez, in his <cite>Memorias</cite>, agrees with
    Juarros in calling them Carthaginians, and states that they arrived in
    that region about four hundred years before Christ, founded Tulan, the
    present Ococingo, and overthrew ancient Culhuacan or Palenque.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
    Brasseur de Bourbourg says <span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>that the Nahuas, coming into Mexico by sea
    at the south [<i>i. e.</i>, in the south central region] slowly moved
    toward the north, to the regions bordering on California, and also
    spreading their civilization across the Usumacinta River, went into
    Yucatan and even Guatemala. This he thinks occurred in the year 174 of
    our era; Xibalba was at the height of her power, but was overthrown in
    the revolution and conquest.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> While we do not attach much certainty
    to the Abbé’s date, still we think that the fall of Xibalba was due to
    Nahua influences brought to bear upon the ancestors of the Quichés.
    The old religion and civilization of the Votanites were compelled
    to yield to the vigorous and warlike power which brought with it a
    religion which has ever commended itself to the senses and impulses of
    semi-civilized peoples. The worship of the sun-symbol of the Heart of
    Heaven was destined to supplant all other faiths.</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that Quetzalcoatl was the leader and deity of the
    Nahuas, and that in their language his name signified “plumed serpent,”
    while Gucumatz, leader and patron deity of the Xibalban conquerors
    has precisely the same significance in the Quiché language. Utatlan
    upon the Guatemalian highlands was doubtless the point from which the
    allied forces under the brothers descended the precipitous road to
    the Usumacinta region below. It is probable that the Nahuas had lived
    for some time in the country, had reached it in their migrations by
    water along the Gulf coast, and spread their population to quarters
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>both north and south of the point at which they entered. They may
    have been permitted to settle in the country without molestation, and
    in time to have united their forces with the rivals of Xibalba for
    the overthrow of a power which was the dread of the entire Central
    American region. The crumbling though wonderful ruins of Palenque are
    the sole vestiges which are left to us of a grand capital and noble
    empire, and these offer us nothing but the sealed histories which are
    graven in hieroglyphics upon its walls. Subsequently the Maya-Quiché
    nations divided and extended their language in three directions;
    one division journeyed toward Guatemala, another toward Mexico, and
    another into Yucatan; the latter region has ever remained a peculiarly
    Maya country. Las Casas states that some of the Guatemalians had a
    legend of their origin, to the effect that a divine pair of beings had
    thirteen sons (but by comparison with other authors, namely, Roman in
    Garcia, and Bancroft, vol. iii, pp. 74–5, it is clear that the writer
    designed to write three—<em>tres</em>—instead of thirteen—<em>trece</em>),
    or rather three sons. The eldest was puffed up in his own conceit, and
    attempted to create man against the will of his parents, but failed,
    except that he was able to produce vessels of the meaner sort. The
    younger sons, who exhibited quite a different spirit, were granted
    the privilege, and after creating the sun and moon and stars, created
    the first man and woman, the progenitors of the human race.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Las
    Casas adds, “They <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>have among them knowledge of the flood and of the
    end of the world. They call it ‘butic,’ a name which signifies a flood
    of many waters. They also believe that another ‘butic’ and judgment
    will come, not of water but of fire. They hold that certain persons
    who escaped from the flood populated their land; these were called the
    Great Father and Great Mother.”<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> In Yucatan the origin traditions
    point directly to an eastern and foreign source for the population.
    The early writers report that the natives believed their ancestors to
    have crossed the sea by a passage which was opened for them.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> It
    was also believed that part of the population came into the country
    from the West. Lizana says that the smaller portion of the population,
    the “little descent,” came from the East, while the greater portion,
    “the great descent,” came from the West.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Cogolludo disagrees with
    this view, and considers the eastern colony as the larger; a view which
    is not likely to be true. The author himself is not quite certain as
    to what he thinks upon the subject, and contradicts himself squarely
    on the same page, as to the direction from which Zamna, the Yucatanic
    culture-hero, is said to have come.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Señor Orozco y Berra, thinks
    that the Yucatanic population came from the north-east (from Florida),
    by way of Cuba and the islands adjacent.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> The culture-hero, Zamna,
    the author of all civilization in Yucatan, is described as the teacher
    of letters and the leader of the people from their ancient home. His
    relation to the people and his office of priest and deity combined—the
    fact that he was the leader of a colony from the East, that he named
    all the divisions of the land, all the towns, coasts, bays and
    rivers—identifies him with Votan or rather with one of his disciples
    or associates. Cogolludo’s statement, first that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>he came from the
    West, may be true of the direction from which he came into Yucatan; and
    the statement that he came from the East, may refer to the original
    migration by which he in company with Votan reached Chiapas and from
    thence entered the peninsula on the north-east. He was the founder of
    the capital city of Mayapan, and after a long life died and was buried
    at Izamal.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> This became a shrine for pilgrims and was visited for
    centuries afterwards by religious devotees in large numbers. Zamna is
    supposed to have founded the oldest royal house in Yucatan—that of the
    Cocomes.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> The second culture-hero, of whom mention is made by all
    the early writers, was Cukulcan (meaning plumed serpent, precisely
    the same as Quetzalcoatl), who entered the country from the West and
    settled at Chichen-Itza.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Landa is not certain whether he preceded
    or followed the Itzas. His celibacy, general purity of morals, and the
    advanced character of his teachings, seem to identify him with the
    Nahua culture-hero, Quetzalcoatl, and it is believed, with reason,
    that he appeared in Yucatan after his mysterious disappearance in
    the province of Goazacoalco. For some unknown reason, Cukulcan left
    Chichen-Itza after a residence there of ten years. Herrera states that
    he had two brothers who remained in Chichen-Itza, while Cukulcan went
    to Mayapan. He describes all as practising the purest asceticism. After
    the disappearance of Cukulcan, temples were erected to his memory and
    he was worshiped as a god.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The date of his residence in Yucatan
    is a matter of considerable dispute, Cogolludo placing it in the
    twelfth century, Herrera in the ninth, Brasseur de Bourbourg in the
    eleventh, and Bancroft in the second. To fix dates on no <span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>better data
    than such legends is folly. It is probable, however, that Cukulcan
    was the culture-hero Quetzalcoatl, who was the teacher of the Nahua
    nations and figured as the introducer of the fine arts, of purity of
    morals, of confessional ceremonies and a humane and enlightened system
    of religion at Cholula, and afterwards disappeared toward the East
    upon the waters of the Gulf. With the rule of the Cocomes and the
    annals of that remarkable branch of the Chiapan family, composed of
    Maya and Nahua elements known as the Tutul Xius, we have nothing to do
    in this work.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> Las Casas, in examining the doctrine of Hunab Ku,
    “the only God” among the Yucatecoes, who is described as the father
    of Zamna, discovered a most striking Christ myth; one which conforms
    so closely to the gospel account of Christ’s birth and ministry that
    we must conclude that either some foreigner must have been cast upon
    the coast after the Christian era began, bringing the gospel with him,
    or that one of two views is true, namely, that the Fathers fabricated
    the story, or that the natives, expecting favor of their conquerors,
    endeavored to harmonize their belief with that which was being taught
    them. Las Casas tells us of their belief in a Trinity consisting of
    Izona, the Father; Bacab, the Son, and Echuah, the Holy Ghost.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
    The Son was born of the Virgin Chibirias, and was rejected of men, was
    scourged and crucified on a tree with cross-arms; he descended into
    the regions of the dead, but rose again on the third day, and finally
    ascended to heaven. In fact the story is the Apostles’ Creed without
    the “Credo,” and is probably as much the work of the credulous and
    imaginative Spanish Fathers as of the designing natives. The story
    ought to be repudiated without question. It only remains for us to
    submit the question to the reader, whether the Maya peoples are not of
    transatlantic origin, as we believe the facts in this chapter indicate.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">IN considering the origin of the Nahua nations, especially of the
    Toltecs and Aztecs, it is common to look upon the former as the first
    inhabitants of Mexico. Such a conclusion is, however, erroneous, since
    the Toltecs were preceded in Central-Southern Mexico, and even in
    Anahuac, both by people of different extraction from themselves and
    by scattering tribes of their own linguistic family, the Nahua. Of
    the former class, the most conspicuous are the so-called Quinametin
    (or Quinames), otherwise known as giants. These fierce and powerful
    people were encountered by the Olmecs, the first Nahuas to colonize
    the region north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. All the early writers
    refer to them in terms which indicate that they were disposed to accept
    the existence of a race of giants as a fact. Veytia and Clavigero,
    however, are convinced that the report is not to be accepted literally.
    The widest possible difference of opinion as to their origin and
    relationship to existing tribes prevails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> with different authors. All
    agree, however, that they were the first inhabitants of the country.
    These cruel monsters, addicted to the most disgusting vices, the
    terror of the immigrating peoples, at last met their fate, according
    to Ixtlilxochitl, in a great convulsion of nature which shook the
    earth and caused the mountains and volcanoes to swallow up and kill
    them.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> It is probable that this account was figurative. Duran
    says they were destroyed by the Tlascaltecs while eating.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Veytia
    attributes the destruction to the Olmec chiefs, who made a feast for
    their enemies and when they were stupid and drunken fell upon them
    and slew them. We think that in this allusion to the giants, “the
    first inhabitants of the land,” we see the Votanic colonists from
    Xibalba that are supposed to have penetrated Anahuac at an early
    day. They may not have carried any special degree of refinement with
    them from their old home, and if they did, they probably lapsed into
    a state of semi-barbarism. Their power as a people, their enmity to
    the immigrants, and their traditional connection with the hated and
    all-powerful Xibalba, may have won for them the name of giants because
    of the fear that was entertained of them; or, as Mr. Bancroft thinks,
    they may not have been savages at all, but a civilized branch of the
    Xibalbans, carrying on the warfare in the North which had been waged
    farther South.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> It is quite probable that we have here a figurative
    allusion, from a Nahua standpoint, to the fall of the Xibalban power
    itself—the new-world Babylon, which, like the old, may have met its
    fate during a drunken revel.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

  <p>To the tribes which figured conspicuously in Mexico prior to the
    Toltecs and not related to the Nahuas, we may add the Miztecs and
    Zapotecs, whose language, though not Maya, is in some respects similar
    to it, while the architectural remains and traditional origin of
    this people associates them with the Nahuas. Their civilization in
    Oajaca rivalled that of the Aztecs in its degree of advancement.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
    The Totonacs were formerly, according to Torquemada, of Nahua
    extraction; but the authority in the face of linguistic difficulties
    is doubtful.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> According to Torquemada’s claim, they were the
    builders of the temple of the sun and moon at Teotihuacan near Lake
    Tezcuco.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The Huastecs of northern Vera Cruz were a Maya branch
    of the power at the south; they mark the most northern point reached
    by the Maya tongue. Of the Nahua predecessors of the Toltecs in
    Mexico the Olmecs and Xicalancas were the most important. They were
    the forerunners of the great nations which followed. According to
    Ixtlilxochitl, these people—which are conceded to be one—occupied the
    new world in the third age; they came from the East in ships or barks
    to the land of Potonchan, which they commenced to populate, and on
    the shores of the River Atoyac, between the Ciudad de los Angeles and
    Cholula, they found some giants who had escaped the calamity which
    overtook that race in the second age of the world.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Here then comes
    the destruction of the giants referred to above. The first settlement
    of the Olmecs and Xicalancas in Mexico is supposed to have been on the
    site of the ancient city of Xicalanco at the point which still bears
    the name, at the entrance of the Laguna de Terminos, while a second
    city, built probably a little later, was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>situated on the coast a short
    distance below Vera Cruz; the entire region bore the name of Anahuac
    Xicalanco.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The first great exploit of the Olmec chiefs, the
    destruction of the giants, we observe was performed at some distance
    from their earliest settlement. The state of Puebla became their chosen
    ground, and quite soon after the above achievement they undertook the
    building of the famous tower of Cholula, which is so closely allied in
    its traditional history with the Tower of Babel. Several authors state
    that the erection of the pyramid of Cholula was done in memory of the
    erection of the tower of Babel, at which it is claimed the ancestors
    of the Olmec chiefs were present. Boturini is probably one of the
    most sanguine advocates of this view.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Others consider that the
    knowledge which the ancestors of this people transmitted to them with
    reference to Babel, in time became associated with the Cholula edifice
    and confounded with its history.</p>

  <p>The Toltecs possessed a deluge tradition, which we will notice
    hereafter, which unquestionably had reference to a very general and
    devastating flood; perhaps the scriptural one, but it is clear, as we
    think we have the authority to show, that the Cholula pyramid and its
    origin had no relation to that tradition, though so often confounded
    with it and the tower referred to by the Nahua chroniclers. The
    generally accepted origin of the pyramid is as follows: from the great
    cataclysm which destroyed the giants, seven of that race of monsters
    escaped by shutting themselves up in a mountain cavern. After the
    waters subsided, Xelhua, one of their number, went to Cholula and began
    the construction of this pyramid “to escape a second flood, should
    another occur,” according to Kingsborough, or as a “memorial of the
    mountain called Tlaloc which had sheltered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>him,” according to Pedro de
    los Rios. The bricks which were manufactured at the foot of the Sierra
    de Cocotl were transported to Cholula by being passed through the
    hands of a file of men extending between the two localities. But the
    angered gods seeing the presumption of mortals, smote both the tower
    and its architects with thunderbolts and stopped their work.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Lord
    Kingsborough so intimately connects the erection of the tower with the
    Toltec deluge legend as to derive Xelhua, the builder of the tower,
    from the Toltecs rather than from the race of giants, by claiming
    that he escaped from the deluge with Paticatle the Mexican Noah in
    an ark, and adds that when the tower was destroyed and the tongues
    of the builders confounded, Xelhua led a colony to the new world.
    This last will serve as a specimen of how the Cholula legend has been
    misunderstood and confounded with the tower of Babel. Father Duran in
    his MS.,<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> <cite>Historia Antigua de la Nueva España</cite>, 1585 <span class="allsmcap">A.
    D.</span>, quotes from the lips of a native of Cholula, over an hundred
    years old, a version of the legend which assigns quite a different
    object for building the Pyramid, one which shows that it never was
    erected as a memorial of Babel nor ever had any reference to an escape
    from any flood either past or in anticipation. It is as follows: “In
    the beginning before the light of the sun had been created, this land
    was in obscurity and darkness and void of any created thing; all was
    a plain without hill or elevation, encircled in every part by water
    without tree or created thing; and immediately after the light and the
    sun arose in the east, there appeared gigantic men of deformed stature,
    and possessed the land, who desiring to see the nativity of the sun as
    well as his occident, proposed to go and seek them. Dividing themselves
    into two parties, some journeyed toward the West and others toward
    the East; these travelled until the sea cut off their road, whereupon
    they determined to return to the place from which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>they started, and
    arriving at this place (Cholula), not finding the means of reaching the
    sun, enamored of his light and beauty, they determined to build a tower
    so high that its summit should reach the sky. Having collected material
    for the purpose, they found a very adhesive clay and bitumen, with
    which they speedily commenced to build the tower, and having reared
    it to the greatest possible altitude, so that they say it reached to
    the sky, the Lord of the Heavens, enraged, said to the inhabitants of
    the sky, ‘Have you observed how they of the earth have built a high
    and haughty tower to mount hither, being enamored of the light of the
    sun and his beauty? Come! and confound them; because it is not right
    that they of the earth, living in the flesh, should mingle with us.’
    Immediately at that very instant the inhabitants of the sky sallied
    forth like flashes of lightning; they destroyed the edifice and divided
    and scattered its builders to all parts of the earth.”<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> This
    account, the most ancient on record, makes no reference to a flood,
    and is quite distinct from the Mexican deluge tradition. Its value as
    an interpreter of the tendency of the American tribes not only of the
    United States and Mexico, but of both Americas, to erect mounds and
    truncated pyramids is not inconsiderable, since it confirms the opinion
    long entertained that they were connected with sun-worship. The great
    culture-hero, Quetzalcoatl, the white saintly personage from the East,
    said to have been the leader of the Nahuas, appeared during the Olmec
    rule, and to his honor the Cholulans erected a temple upon the pyramid
    which their countrymen or predecessors had failed to complete.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
    Quetzalcoatl was, however, no tribal hero, but was so intimately
    identified with the institutions and civilization of the entire Nahua
    race that we purposely defer a consideration of his character at
    present in order that we may hasten to the traditional origin of the
    Toltecs.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

  <p>It is not our purpose to go back to the several traditions of the
    creation of man, preserved in as many localities in Mexico, each with
    its own variations, but simply to take up tradition where it first
    relates to the Toltec families. We are fully aware of the wide range
    of opinion with reference to what properly constitutes this tradition,
    and of the irreconcilable variations in dates and numeric details
    among the several Spanish writers. Probably all will agree that the
    native writer Ixtlilxochitl, who inherited the rich collection of royal
    archives and hieroglyphic paintings belonging to his ancestors (and
    which fortunately escaped the wholesale vandalism of the conquerors),
    though both contradictory and negligent, has furnished us the most
    reliable narrative which has yet been brought to light. Without
    attempting to correct or unravel his chronology, we simply translate
    his account of the origin of the Toltecs. Speaking of the first age
    of the world, the pre-diluvial period, he says: “It is found in the
    histories of the Toltecs that this age and first world as they call
    it, lasted 1716 years; that men were destroyed by tremendous rains and
    lightning from the sky, and even all the land without the exception
    of anything, and the highest mountains, were covered up and submerged
    in water ‘caxtolmoletlti,’ or <em>fifteen cubits</em>, and here they
    add other fables of how men came to multiply from the few who escaped
    from this destruction in a ‘toptlipetlacali,’ that this word nearly
    signifies a close chest; and how after men had multiplied they erected
    a very high ‘zacuali,’ which is to say a tower of great height, in
    order to take refuge in it, should the second world (age) be destroyed.
    Presently their languages were confused; and not able to understand
    each other, they went to different parts of the earth. The Toltecs,
    consisting of seven friends with their wives, who understood the
    same language, came to these parts, having first passed great land
    and seas, having lived in caves, and having endured great hardships
    in order to reach this land, which they found good and fertile for
    their habitation; and relate that they wandered one hundred and four
    years through different parts of the world before they reached Hue hue
    Tlapalan, which was in Ce Tecpatl, five hundred and twenty years after
    the flood. Seventeen hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> and fifteen years after the flood, there
    was a terrible hurricane that carried away trees, mounds, houses and
    the largest edifices, notwithstanding which many men and women escaped
    principally in caves and places where the great hurricane could not
    reach them. A few days having passed, they set out to see what had
    become of the earth, when they found it all covered and populated with
    monkeys. All this time they were in darkness without seeing the light
    of the sun nor the moon that the wind had brought them. The Indians
    invented a fable which says that men were changed into monkeys. * * *
    One hundred and fifty-eight years after the great hurricane and 4994
    from the creation of the world, there was another destruction of this
    land, which was of the Quinametin, giants who lived in New Spain, which
    destruction was a great trembling of the earth, which swallowed up and
    killed them, the mountains and volcanoes burst upon them, that for a
    certainty none should escape. At the same time many of the Toltecs
    perished and the Chichimecs their neighbors. That was in the year Ce
    Tecpatl; and this age they call Tlachilonatnip, that is to say, sun [or
    age] of earth.”<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Here follows an account of the construction of
    the calendar by the assembly of Lords in Hue hue Tlapalan in the year
    5097 of the creation of the world and 104 after the destruction of the
    giants.</p>

  <p>The singular agreement of this account with the Mosaic description,
    in some of its details, such as the height attained by the waters
    above the mountains, the escape of certain persons in an ark, and
    the erection of a high tower, together with the subsequent confusion
    of tongues, Lord Kingsborough is convinced furnishes proof that the
    Toltecs were of Jewish descent.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> While we are not prepared to
    believe the sanguine speculations of that eminent author in this
    case, still one of two views must be true: either the Toltecs were
    of old world origin, and at a remote period treasured up among their
    traditional histories notices of the Mosaic deluge, traditions of
    which are so generally <span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>current among the Asiatic nations, or the
    Mexican traditions of local inundation were warped by the teachings
    of the Spanish priests in a degree beyond any precedent in history
    or reasonable expectation, and that within a comparatively few years
    after the conquest. Our authority in this case is a native of Tezcuco,
    a son of the queen; and because of his acquaintance with both the
    hieroglyphic writings and the Castilian, served as interpreter to
    the viceroy. His <cite>Relacions</cite> were composed from the archives of
    his family and compared with the testimony of the oldest and best
    informed natives. It does not seem to us that the sense of historic
    integrity cultivated to so nice a point at Tezcuco, where the censorial
    council, just prior to the advent of the conquerors, punished with
    death any who should willfully pervert the truth, could have so
    sadly degenerated that Ixtlilxochitl and the venerable natives who
    were conscious of the representations contained in his work, should
    proclaim a falsehood which would not meet with contradiction.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> We
    are aware that this author’s chronology is an inextricable maze of
    contradictions which cannot be unravelled or reconstructed. The Toltec
    families, seven in number, are, however, said to have reached Hue hue
    Tlapalan five hundred and twenty years after the flood. The journey,
    however, occupied only one hundred and four years of that time. Their
    wanderings, attended with severe experiences, nakedness, and hunger and
    cold, were over many lands, across expanses of sea and through untold
    hardships.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

  <p>The date of the migration to Hue hue Tlapalan cannot be approximated
    from available data, but it is evident that Ixtlilxochitl fixes it
    at 520 years after the flood, or 2236 years after the creation—a
    period which must have antedated the Christian era by a score of
    centuries or more, even if we accept his chronology, which (on p.
    322 of his <cite>Relacions</cite>), implies that more than five thousand
    years elapsed between the creation and the birth <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>of Christ. The
    <i>Codex Chimalpopoca</i>, a Nahua record written in Spanish letters,
    which occupies probably the same relation to early Mexican history
    that the <cite>Popol Vuh</cite> does to the Maya history, has been made
    known to us through the writings of Brasseur de Bourbourg, but as
    yet it has not been published. Ixtlilxochitl was the copyist of this
    document, and of course used it in composing his <cite>Relacions</cite>.
    Mr. Bancroft has attempted to collect from scattered passages, taken
    from the <cite>Codex Chimalpopoca</cite> and found in Brasseur’s writings,
    a continuous narrative, but with little success. “The division of
    the earth,” by the sun, “six times four hundred, plus one hundred,
    plus thirteen years ago to-day, the twenty-second of May, 1558;” in
    other words, in the year 955 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, is a date obtained which
    seems to refer to the division of the land among the followers of
    Votan.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> In the <cite>Popol Vuh</cite>, Gucumatz (whose name signifies
    plumed serpent) is described as going in search of maize, while the
    <cite>Codex Chimalpopoca</cite> describes Quetzalcoatl, whose name is
    identical in meaning with that of Gucumatz, as entering upon the same
    undertaking, though under somewhat different circumstances, and states
    that when he had found it, he brought it to Tamoanchan.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> We shall
    see hereafter that Sahagun locates Tamoanchan in Tabasco, a fact of
    considerable value in studying the Toltec migration. The reader will
    not, however, associate Quetzalcoatl with the above date, since such
    is not the purport of the record. The <cite>Chimalpopoca</cite> implies that
    Quetzalcoatl afterwards becoming obnoxious to his companions forsook
    them, a statement noted by Mr. Bancroft, though its full value does not
    seem to have been observed by that author.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> The account clearly
    refers to the role of Quetzalcoatl among the Quichés, when he was
    known as Gucumatz, and prior to his appearance among the Olmec (Nahua)
    tribes. It indicates that the <cite>Codex Chimalpopoca</cite> account of the
    discovery of maize is purely Quiché, and has no reference to the Nahuas
    whatever. The search for maize by the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>plumed serpent, call him by
    either his Quiché or Nahua name if you wish, was prior to the advent of
    that remarkable personage among the Nahuas. The reputed discovery we
    consider nothing more than a figurative allusion to the introduction of
    agriculture by this culture-hero, the knowledge of which he afterwards
    communicated to the Nahuas at Tamoanchan. If these inferences are
    true, the <cite>Codex Chimalpopoca</cite>, so far as we are acquainted
    with its contents, can render us no assistance with reference to the
    question in hand. We will now return to the beginning of the subject
    and cite additional authorities, chief among them Sahagun. In the
    introduction to his <cite>Historia General</cite>, in speaking of the origin
    of this people, he expresses the opinion that it is impossible to
    definitely determine more than that they report “that all the natives
    came from seven caves, and that these seven caves are the seven ships
    or galleys in which the first populators of the land came.” He adds,
    “The first people came to populate this land from towards Florida,
    and came coasting and disembarked at the port of Pánuco, which they
    called Panco, which signifies a place to which they come who pass the
    water. This people came in quest of the terrestrial paradise, and
    were known by the name Tamoanchan, by which they mean, ‘we seek our
    home.’ They settled around the highest mountains that they found. In
    coming toward the midday to find the terrestrial paradise, they did
    not err, because it is the opinion of the knowing that it is under the
    equinoctial line.”<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> The above account is rendered more definite
    in the following passage from his third volume:<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> “Countless years
    ago the first settlers arrived in these parts of New Spain—which is
    nearly another world—coming with ships by sea, approached a port at
    the North, and because they disembarked there, it is called Panutla or
    Panaoia, place where they arrive who come by the sea; at present it
    is corruptly called Pantlan. From that port they commenced to journey
    by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>the shores of the sea, ever beholding the snow-capped Sierras and
    the volcanoes, until they came to the province of Guatemala, being
    guided by their priest who carried with him their god, with whom he
    always counseled concerning what he should do. They settled down in
    Tamoanchan, where they were a long time, and never ceased to have their
    wise men or prophets, called Amoxoaqui, which signifies ‘men learned
    in the ancient paintings,’ who, although they came at the same time,
    did not remain with the rest in Tamoanchan, for leaving them there,
    they re-embarked and took with them all the paintings of the rites
    and mechanic arts which they had brought.” The account continues by
    stating that the priests informed their companions before leaving them,
    that their God had made them masters of the land, and that they should
    inhabit it and await his return. The priests then departed towards
    the East with their idol wrapped in blankets. Whereupon the people
    invented judicial astrology and the art of interpreting dreams. They
    there also constructed the calendar which was followed during the time
    of the Toltecs, Mexicans, Tepanecs and Chichimecs. The first migratory
    movement was to Teotihuacan, where they erected two mountains in honor
    of the sun and moon. Here they elected their rulers and buried their
    princes, erecting mounds over their graves. This seems to have become
    their holy city. The main power which had remained for a long time in
    Tamoanchan was changed to Xumiltepec. From this latter place they,
    however, at the instance of their priests, started again on their
    migrations. First going to Teotihuacan in order to choose their wise
    men. Notwithstanding the remarks of Sahagun that the seven caves were
    the seven ships in which the first settlers came to New Spain, he here
    affirms that in the course of their migration they came to the valley
    of the seven caves. How long they remained in this national centre
    we have no means of knowing, but eventually their god told them to
    retrace their steps, which they did, going to Tollancingo (Tulancingo)
    and finally to Tulan (Tollan). Ixtlilxochitl, if he can be relied
    upon (and if he is unreliable we might as well give up the task of
    tracing the early history of this or any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> Mexican people) shows
    clearly that the ancestors of the Toltecs were possessed of certain
    traditions which point to an Asiatic origin; that at a remote period
    they set out from that common home of so many peoples, possessing the
    same traditions, in search of a suitable country in which to live; that
    after one hundred and four years occupied in traversing broad lands and
    seas, they arrived in a country called Hue hue Tlapalan. This event,
    according to his chronology, must have occurred upwards of twenty
    centuries before Christ. He tells us also that in Hue hue Tlapalan, the
    Toltecs regulated their calendar. Sahagun says that countless years
    ago the first inhabitants of the country (Mexico) came by sea from the
    direction of Florida on the North, and landing at Pánuco, journeyed
    down the coast to Guatemala (which is supposed to have embraced Chiapas
    and perhaps Tabasco, though such is only the conjecture of an earnest
    advocate of the Southern location of Hue hue Tlapalan, <i>i. e.</i>,
    Mr. Bancroft) where they established a city called Tamoanchan—there
    the calendar was regulated or corrected. Whether this was the same
    construction of the calendar referred to by Ixtlilxochitl as having
    taken place in Hue hue Tlapalan is questionable. If positive proof of
    the identity of these occurrences could be produced, the identity of
    Tamoanchan and Hue hue Tlapalan would be complete, and the disputed
    location of the latter would be fixed in the Chiapan region or the
    country of the Xibalbans. The fact that Quetzalcoatl brought maize to
    Tamoanchan seems to indicate a comparative proximity of that country to
    the Southern region where that culture-hero figured so conspicuously
    under the Quiché name of Gucumatz. If no other testimony need be
    introduced the disputed locality might be fixed as above indicated.
    However, the contradictory records of Ixtlilxochitl, which we are now
    about to cite, unsettle this conclusion. The Toltec migration from Hue
    hue Tlapalan is briefly as follows: Three hundred and thirty-eight
    years after Christ a revolt occurred among the Toltecs in Hue hue
    Tlapalan, in which two rebel princes attempted to depose the legitimate
    successor to the throne. These rebel chiefs, named Chalcatzin and
    Tlacamihtzin respectively, were unsuccessful, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span> together with five
    other chiefs and their numerous allies and people, were driven out of
    their city Tlachicatzin in Hue hue Tlapalan. After a journey of sixty
    leagues, they arrived at a place which they called Tlapallanconco, or
    Little Tlapalan. Their departure from their old home did not occur till
    they had withstood a contest of eight years—or, according to Veytia,
    thirteen years—duration.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> At Tlapallanconco they lived three years,
    at the end of which time there arose among them a great astrologer,
    named Hueman or Huematzin, who counseled them to forsake the land of
    their misfortunes and journey toward the rising sun, where there was
    a happy land formerly occupied by Quinames, but now depopulated. This
    advice seeming good they set out on their journey at the end of the
    three years, or eleven years after leaving Hue hue Tlapalan. After
    traveling twelve days and accomplishing seventy leagues they arrived
    at Hueyxalan, and remained there four years. From thence a twenty days
    journey toward the East, or according to Veytia, toward the West, and
    of one hundred leagues in length, brought them to Xalisco, near the
    sea-shore. Here they remained eight years. Twenty days journey and 100
    leagues more brought them to Chimalhuacan on the coast opposite certain
    islands, where they resided five years. Eighteen days or 80 leagues
    traversed toward the East, and they arrived at Toxpan, where they
    dwelt five years more. Proceeding eastward twenty days’ journey or 100
    leagues, they came to Quiyahuitztlan Anahuac, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>situated on the coast.
    Here they were obliged to pass inlets of the sea in boats. During a
    six years’ sojourn at this point, they suffered many hardships. An
    eighteen days’ journey or 80 leagues brought them to Zacatlan where
    they dwelt seven years. From thence they journeyed eighty leagues to
    Totzapan and dwelt there six years. They next journeyed to Tepetla,
    distant twenty-eight days, or 140 leagues, where they dwelt seven
    years. Eighteen days’ journey or 80 leagues brought them to Mazatepec,
    where they remained eight years, and a similar journey brought them
    to Ziuhcohuatl where they tarried also eight years. Turning northward
    from this unknown point, they journeyed twenty days or 100 leagues
    and halted at Yztachuexucha, where they dwelt twenty-six years.
    At last, after a journey of eighteen days or eighty leagues, they
    arrived at Tulancingo (Tulantzinco, or Tollantzinco) a name already
    familiar to us. Here the Toltecs emerge from what has been to us an
    unknown wilderness without geographic guide-post or even a polar
    star by which to reckon. Their itinerary, full of so many gaps and
    inconsistencies, its frequent omission of the directions traversed,
    with its starting-point so indefinitely located, is meaningless and
    confusing, and so far as the reader is concerned, practically begins
    nowhere and ends in nothing. At Tulancingo they remained eighteen
    years, living in a house sufficiently large to accommodate them all.
    Their knowledge of architecture must have been quite advanced to have
    enabled them to construct such an edifice. The third year after their
    arrival at Tulancingo, marked a Toltec age of 104 years from the time
    they left their home in Hue hue Tlapalan. Finally, eighteen years
    having elapsed, they transferred the capital to Tollan, afterwards the
    centre of the Toltec empire. Tollan is stated to have been eastward
    of Tulancingo (in all probability a mistake).<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> In this migration
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>we have a distance of 1150 leagues traversed; the first two moves,
    aggregating 130 leagues, is in an unknown direction; the next advance
    is 100 leagues in an easterly direction, according to one author, and
    westerly according to another; however, it is agreed that the point
    was on the sea-shore. The next move of 100 leagues is still along the
    sea-shore, but the direction is not stated. We then have two advances
    amounting to 180 leagues, in an easterly direction. The confusion
    is completed in the following advances, aggregating 460 leagues in
    unknown directions. Of the remaining 180 leagues, 100 were traveled in
    a northern direction, while the remaining 80 leagues were taken toward
    an unknown quarter. It is quite plain to any one, that the distances
    traversed in the directions stated could not be traced consistently
    with the geography of Mexico and Central America, upon the assumption
    that Tamoanchan and Hue hue Tlapalan are identical and situated in the
    Rio Usumacinta region. The itinerary would carry the emigrants far
    out upon the Gulf of Mexico. It is evident that a broader territory
    than that of Southern Mexico and Central America is required for the
    realization of such distances. The account of the migration is no doubt
    faulty; but even if we disregard the gaps, it presents insuperable
    difficulties when applied to the South-Mexican region. It is manifest
    that Sahagun and Ixtlilxochitl refer to different migrations. The
    former to the Olmecs, who came by sea to Pánuco and thence to Tabasco,
    from which they migrated north to Teotihuacan. The latter narrates the
    wanderings of the Toltecs who subsequently came into Mexico by land.
    If this distinction is borne in mind, much of the obscurity attending
    the subject is cleared away. We are inclined to think that the accounts
    of the two distinct migrations have become confused, and the details
    of one substituted for the details of the other. Every one familiar
    with the study of traditional histories is aware of this danger, or
    even more, this tendency among semi-civilized peoples. No better
    illustration of this fact can be presented than the sad confusion which
    has been wrought by nearly every writer who has attempted to describe
    the two distinct personages in Mexican history, known by the name of
    Quetzalcoatl. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> Sahagun of all the early writers has seemed to have
    any clear conception of their individual and independent attributes.
    The demi-god, and the Toltec king, and the achievements of each, have
    been made to change places so often by Spanish writers, that the result
    has, with each new treatment of the subject, been confusion worse
    confounded. Sahagun’s account of the arrival of the Nahuas in ships,
    from the direction of Florida, their landing in Pánuco, their journey
    toward Guatemala, their residence in Tamoanchan (probably somewhere
    in the Chiapan region) and their subsequent migration northward to
    Teotihuacan with its well-known pyramids, and finally their removal
    to Tollan, north of the City of Mexico, by the way of Tolancingo,
    is a straightforward account which finds support in the best of
    evidence, both of a material and linguistic character. Sr. Orozco y
    Berra has clearly shown by linguistic testimony that the Nahua nations
    entered the country somewhere between the nineteenth and twenty-first
    degrees of north latitude, on the Gulf coast, migrated southward to
    a point seventeen and one-half degrees north latitude, almost to the
    Chiapan region, and then retracing their steps northward, almost to a
    point opposite Vera Cruz, they crossed Mexico to the Pacific coast,
    along which they extended their language northward nearly to the
    twenty-seventh degree north latitude.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Sahagun says nothing of Hue
    hue Tlapalan in his account of the migration from Tamoanchan to Tollan
    or from Chiapas to Anahuac, for his account refers to the Olmecs, the
    first Nahuas to reach Mexico.</p>

  <p>Mr. John H. Becker, of Berlin, in an able paper addressed to the
    Congrès des Américainistes at Luxembourg (<cite>Compte Rendu de la Seconde
    Session</cite>, tom. i, pp. 325–50), after offering plausible arguments
    for the identification of Tulan Zuiva of the Quichés, Hue hue Tlapalan
    of the Toltecs, Amaquemecan of the Chichimecs, and Oztotlan of the
    Aztecs, with the region of the upper Rio Grande del Norte and Rio
    Colorado—the land of the ravines, of grottoes, and of cañons—attempts
    to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>trace the Toltec migration as given by Ixtlilxochitl. His
    interesting solution of the difficult problem is as follows: “The
    Toltecs driven out of Hue hue Tlapalan by civil wars (towards the end
    of the fourth century of our era?) move in a westerly direction sixty
    leagues to Tlapalanconco (northern Sinaloa and Sonora on the Rio Yaqui,
    where distinct traces of the Nahua language exist?); thence, after
    eleven years, they go to Hueyxalan, seventy leagues distant (perhaps
    the northern part of Durango, where the Tepehuana language shows strong
    Nahua affinities); thence to Xalisco on the coast, one hundred leagues
    distant; thence to Chimalhuacan Atenco on the coast opposite some
    islands, one hundred leagues (opposite the islands in the southern end
    of the Gulf of California)? In that case they did undoubtedly suffer a
    reverse in Xalisco (where they touched upon the more thickly populated
    and civilized country, and by which they were forced to retire); thence
    eastward eighty leagues to Toxpan (in the neighborhood of the Laguna de
    Tlahuila and on the upper Sabina River). In that country there is even
    now a tribe of Tochos, and the Tarahumara language there spoken, shows
    distinct affinities to the Nahua tongue; thence eastward one hundred
    leagues to Quahuitzlan Anahuac, on the coast with inlets—the coast-land
    of the state of Tamaulipas, on the Gulf of Mexico? About this locality
    there can scarcely be a doubt, since this eastern coast country and the
    eastern plateau bore the general name Quetzalapan or Huitzilapan, until
    the Nahuas took possession of them, when the plateau was designated
    as <i>Huitznahuac</i>, and the name above given would be the natural
    one to apply to the coast, since while <i>nahuac</i> (<i>an</i>) means
    simply the Nahualand, <i>Anahuac</i> (<i>an</i>) means the ‘Nahua land
    on the water,’ while Quahuitzlan is the old name retained in order to
    distinguish this Anahuac on the Gulf coast from the Anahuac around the
    Mexican lakes. Here they ‘suffered great hardships,’ and finally went
    westward eighty leagues to Zacatlan (the northern part of the State
    of Zacatecas?); from there eighty leagues to Totzapan, probably again
    in the neighborhood of Toxpan before mentioned (where the Tusanes are
    located even to-day); thence one hundred and forty leagues to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> Tepetla
    (the extraordinary distance shows that at last they gained a decisive
    victory, and broke through the frontier of the more civilized country
    which they had hitherto felt). Tepetla, mountainland, must consequently
    be sought in the neighborhood of the high mountains of Anahuac; thence
    eighty leagues to Mazatepec (the mountain of the Mazahuas, skirting
    the valley of Mexico towards north and west); thence eighty leagues to
    Ziuhcohuatl, where they probably suffered another defeat, for they move
    full one hundred leagues northward to Yztachuechucha, and stop there
    twenty-three years, a sufficient time to raise another generation of
    warriors; thence eighty leagues to Tollantzingo, and then finally to
    ‘Tollan,’ the capital of their future empire, which if Ixtlilxochitl’s
    dates can be trusted, they built about 500 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, on the site
    of a former city of the Otomis.” This ingenious and thoughtful review
    of the route commends itself to all who are interested in this subject.
    Mr. Becker considers that one great argument for the correctness of the
    starting-point which he has chosen is “the fact that even the distances
    as given by Ixtlilxochitl agree with the actual situation of the
    various localities here indicated.” Ixtlilxochitl, obscure as he is,
    gives in another part of his work an additional account, besides the
    one we have already quoted, which greatly strengthens our conviction
    that the Toltecs came into Mexico from the north, and confirms the
    investigations of both Mr. Becker and of Sr. Orozco. The account is
    as follows: “In this fourth age there came to this land of Anahuac,
    which is at present called New Spain, those of the Toltec nations who,
    according to the accounts of their histories, were expelled from their
    land, and after having navigated and coasted on the South Sea along
    various lands as far as the present California, they came to what is
    called Huitlapalan, that which at present they call after Cortés. This
    locality they passed in the year called Ce Tecpatl, which was in the
    year 387 of the incarnation of our Lord. Having coasted the land of
    Xalisco, and all the coast of the south, they set out from the port
    of Huatulco, and went through various lands as far as the province of
    Tochtepec, situated on the coast of the North Sea, and having traversed
    and viewed it they came to stop in the province of Tulantzinco,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> having
    left some people in most of their stopping-places in order to populate
    them.”<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

  <p>It will be observed that in this migration part of the same general
    route above referred to, along the Pacific coast nearly opposite the
    extremity of the California peninsula, and then returning southward
    and inland, is clearly marked out. The Pacific ocean, called the South
    Sea, seems to have facilitated their movements northward. Xalisco
    was coasted, and the entire width of Mexico traversed, the Gulf of
    Mexico reached (Sea of the North), and finally Tolancingo chosen as a
    suitable home. It will be observed that the Huitlapalan named above is
    not identical with Hue hue Tlapalan, the earliest home of the nations.
    Mr. Bancroft has apparently confounded the two names, and endeavors to
    find in the Tlapallan de Cortés (so named because of Cortés’ expedition
    to a Tlapallan) the ancient Hue hue Tlapalan.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> The Abbé Brasseur
    de Bourbourg attempts precisely the same thing. The investigations of
    both these writers on this point are interesting, though without any
    result, unless unintentionally to strengthen the above distinction
    between Huitlapalan and Hue hue Tlapalan. Substantially the facts are
    as follows: Pedro de Alvarado, writing from Santiago or old Guatemala
    to Cortés in 1524, refers to Tlapallan as fifteen days march inland,
    and Mr. Bancroft thinks that the name must have been applied to a
    region corresponding to either Honduras, Peten or Tabasco. Cortés’ name
    was affixed to a Tlapallan said to lie towards Ihueras or Ibueras, the
    former name of Honduras, because of his expedition to that country.
    The Abbé says the name was applied to a region between the tributaries
    of the Rio Usumacinta and Honduras. Finally, the fact that the second
    Quetzalcoatl, when he embarked on the Gulf coast near the Goazacoalco
    River, announced his intention of going to Tlapallan, is cited as
    proof that the name was applied to a southern locality.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>The
    entire argument is perfectly satisfactory in locating a Tlapallan in
    the Usumacinta region, but it does not have the slightest value in
    proving that Hue hue Tlapalan was identical with that locality. On
    the other hand, Cabrera, in referring to the ancient country of the
    Toltecs, calls it Hue Hue Tlapalan, and states that the simple name was
    Tlapallan, but that it was called Hue hue—old—to distinguish it from
    three other Tlapalans which they founded in the new districts which
    they came to inhabit. This statement is confirmed by Torquemada.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
    It is therefore probable that Bancroft’s and Brasseur’s investigations
    were all expended on one or more of these three Tlapalans. The
    undoubted residence of a tribe of the Nahuas (Olmecs) in the Tabasco
    region for a considerable period—one which is measured relatively in
    the language of Sahugun between the “countless years ago when they
    arrived from towards Florida” and their departure towards Anahuac in
    the fourth or fifth century—has led many writers to suppose that they
    were of southern origin, notwithstanding the statement of Sahagun,
    Ixtlilxochitl and all the early writers to the contrary. Supposing
    that the sweeping assumption of the northern origin so persistently
    adhered to by native and Spanish writers is nothing but a priestly
    fabrication, be admitted, simply that our attention may be turned to
    other testimony, still the evidence is against the southern origin
    theory. The material relics of Honduras and Nicaragua absolutely
    disprove the positive supposition that they were ever the work of the
    people who figured in Anahuac, and no transition from one style of
    sculpture to the other has ever been discovered, nor could be imagined.
    An examination of the first few chapters of Mr. Bancroft’s fourth
    volume and the works from which it has been drawn will fully satisfy
    the reader of this fact. The evidence from the linguistic standpoint is
    even more satisfactory, since the Nahua language as spoken in Central
    America, in the states of San Salvador and Nicaragua, is dialectic,
    indicating a fragmentary migration southward.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

  <p>It has been the common custom of Spanish writers and those who
    followed them down to the middle of this century, to locate Hue hue
    Tlapalan on the Californian coast. Vater and Humboldt from their
    standpoints of investigation fell in with this view. The former,
    basing his convictions on seeming linguistic affinities in the
    north-west, which, while they are quite significant, indicative of
    Nahua influences if not of Nahua residence, are too few to prove any
    lengthy sojourn. Humboldt based his opinion chiefly on the traditions
    and certain ethnological and geographical facts. Buschmann<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> has
    completely overthrown the arguments of Vater in his series of works
    on American languages, while Mr. Bancroft has shown conclusively that
    there are no material remains assignable to the Toltecs to be found on
    the Californian coast or the adjoining region.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> When he asserts,
    however, that there are no remains farther north than California, he
    overlooks a well-known fact. We refer to the mounds of Oregon and
    their extension eastward into the Yellowstone and North Missouri River
    region. The most reasonable conjecture as to the locality of Hue hue
    Tlapalan is that which places it in the Mississippi Valley, and assigns
    the works of our Mound-builders to the Nahua nations. In previous
    chapters we have shown the close resemblance of the mound crania to
    the ancient Mexican, and have pointed out the gradual transition from
    the rude and simple mounds of the north to the truncated pyramid of
    the south, constructed on strict geometrical principles, having one
    or more graded ways, and so closely resembling the Mexican teocallis.
    Besides the testimony of Sahagun that the first settlers of Mexico
    came from towards Florida, and the universal report of a northern
    origin prevalent among the Aztecs at the time of the conquest, there
    are other evidences of a racial identity common to Mound-builders and
    Mexicans, such as pottery, sculptured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span> portraitures of the facial type,
    indications of commercial intercourse between the two countries, such
    as the discovery of Mexican obsidian in the mounds of the Ohio Valley,
    and the probability that both worshipped the sun and offered human
    sacrifices.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

  <p>With the Toltec annals proper we have nothing to do; only the most
    primitive period of the growth of this people concerns us here, and
    that period is conceded to have closed with the establishment of the
    great capital at Tollan, on the site of the present village of Tula,
    thirty miles north-west of the city of Mexico. Seven years after the
    arrival of the Toltecs in Tollan, the government was a theocratic
    republic, with the seven chiefs who had conducted them thither acting
    as their rulers, under the advice of the venerable Huemen. Finally,
    in the beginning of the eighth century, somewhere between 710 and
    720 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, the republic was changed into a monarchy and the
    throne given to the son of their dreaded enemies and former neighbors,
    the warlike Chichimecs, as a peace-offering, on condition that the
    Toltecs should always be a free people and in no way tributary to the
    Chichimecs. The history of the Toltec monarchy during the three and
    a half centuries of its duration to the final overthrow of Tollan
    (1062 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) as well as the power of the remarkable people
    who built the ancient capital, has often been sketched, and for us
    to repeat what has been recorded in almost every language of modern
    Europe, would add nothing to the cause of science. This part of ancient
    American history, so replete with the romantic and marvellous, so
    confusing at times, because of our ignorance of many geographic and
    archæologic features entering into it (which, in time, will probably
    be brought to light), so saddening because of its stories of wholesale
    misfortunes to a people whose civilization rivalled that of Europe in
    the middle ages; and yet, after all, so fresh and novel, must <span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>continue
    to receive increased attention, if only as a means of recreation to
    the student of history, wearied with the beaten paths from Rome to
    Greece, and from Greece to Rome. Mr. Bancroft has given an excellent
    <i>resumé</i> of the annals of the Toltec period, accompanying it with
    an ample literary apparatus in the notes. During the last century of
    the Toltec power, Anahuac was overrun by the incursions of a fierce and
    dreaded people—the Chichimecs. These semi-barbarians, taking advantage
    of the internal dissensions in the Toltec monarchy, became a powerful
    factor, either on their own part or in the hands of the enemies of
    Tollan, in the overthrow of the empire. In the Toltec traditions we
    read of the Chichimecs being their neighbors in Hue hue Tlapalan.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
    In the annals as given in Ixtlilxochitl, Torquemada and many writers,
    the Chichimecs are represented as having pursued and annoyed the
    Toltecs, to have followed them up in their wanderings. This probably
    is not literally true, but their arrival upon the borders of Anahuac,
    soon after its occupation by the Toltecs, is quite certain. It has
    been common to consider the Chichimecs as a Nahua people, and even so
    critical a writer as Mr. Bancroft adopts this popular error. As long
    ago as 1855, Sr. Francisco Pimentel undertook to show the mistake into
    which many had fallen, and in his <cite>Lenguas Indigenas de Mexico</cite>
    (published in 1862), has furnished conclusive proof that the Chichimecs
    originally spoke a different language from the Nahua nations, but
    subsequently adopted the Nahua tongue, on the principle set forth by
    Balbi: “It is not the language of the conquering people that invariably
    dominates, but that which is most regular and cultured.” On the
    testimony of Torquemada,<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> Ixtlilxochitl<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> and Juan Bautista
    Pomar,<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Sr. Pimentel shows that the Chichimec language was once
    distinct and different from the Nahua, and that these people came under
    the civilizing influences of the Toltecs during their golden age,
    but in their declining period availed themselves <span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>of the opportunity
    of possessing their country and advanced civilization.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> If the
    Chichimecs were the neighbors of the Toltecs in Hue hue Tlapalan, it
    is reasonable to expect some light on the situation of that disputed
    locality in the Chichimec traditions; but in this expectation we are
    disappointed. There is no mention of that ancient home of the Nahuas,
    nor of any route pursued in their migrations. Amaquemecan is the only
    name which is applied to their most primitive land or history; one of
    the cities which they occupied at some remote period seems to have
    borne the name. When the Toltecs sent to the Chichimecs for their first
    king, they were, according to Ixtlilxochitl, in the neighborhood of
    Panuco. Panes describes them as having passed the sea, and, according
    to their reckoning, in the year Five Tolti to have arrived at the seven
    caves. Thence they journeyed to Amacatepeque, and certain persons
    left that province to go to Tepenec, which is to say “the Mountain
    of Echo.”<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Ixtlilxochitl and some other authors derive them from
    Chicomoztoc, a rendezvous of the nations, which has been located by
    Clavigero at about twenty miles south of Zacatecas but is considered
    by Duran and Acosta as identical with Aztlan in the region of
    Florida.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> It is impossible to determine either the starting-point
    or route of this people, who subsequently became amalgamated with the
    scattered Toltecs after the fall of Tollan, and whose rule in Anahuac
    may properly be dated from the (1062) middle of the eleventh until
    nearly the middle of the fifteenth (1431) century.</p>

  <p>A few years after the Chichimec power was established there came
    from the North (at least their last move is admitted to have been
    from that quarter) six tribes of Nahuatlacas, who arrived in the
    country adjoining Tollan. There were altogether seven tribes, namely,
    the Xochimilcos, Chalcas, Tepanecs, Tlahuicas, Acolhuas, Tlascatecs
    and Aztecs or Mexicans. The latter people, however, had separated
    themselves from the remaining <span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>six tribes at Chicomoztoc and did not
    reach Anahuac until about 1196 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> These people all acted
    as tributary to the Chichimecs at first; and of the seven tribes,
    two eventually arose to great political importance, the Tlascatecs
    who founded an independent republic, and the Aztecs whose empire
    has been the wonder of students of antiquity and the subject of
    histories as romantic as the purest fiction. Some authors add a number
    of tribal names to those already given as belonging to fragments
    of the Nahuatlaca family, but the probability is that these minor
    and unimportant tribes were offshoots from the others, after their
    arrival on the central plateau. The representative branch of all the
    Nahuatlacas was the Aztec nation, who separated from their brethren
    in Chicomoztoc, and whose arrival at the Lake region of Mexico, is
    dated subsequent to that of the other tribes. All of these tribes
    are said to have come from the unknown Aztlan, their early home. The
    question of its locality has been as much a subject of controversy
    as the location of Hue hue Tlapalan, since, in fact, the question is
    possibly one and the same, for the Nahua speaking people who migrated
    into Mexico at intervals, extending over a period of a thousand years,
    must have had a common origin. Aztlan is described by Duran as a most
    attractive land and the presumption is that the Nahuas were forcibly
    driven from their fair heritage by the gradual encroachments of their
    enemies. The account of this delightful country given by Cueuhcoatl to
    the elder Montezuma, is as follows: “Our fathers dwelt in that happy
    and prosperous place which they called Aztlan, which means “whiteness.”
    In this place there is a great mountain in the middle of the water,
    which is called Culhuacan, because it has the point somewhat turned
    over toward the bottom, and for this cause it is called Culhuacan,
    which means “crooked mountain.” In this mountain were some openings,
    or caves or hollows, where our fathers and ancestors dwelt for many
    years; there, under this name Mexitin and Aztec, they had much repose;
    there they enjoyed a great plenty of geese; of all species of marine
    birds and water fowls; enjoyed the song and melody of birds with yellow
    crests; enjoyed many kinds of large and beautiful fish; enjoyed the
    freshness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span> of trees that were upon those shores, and fountains enclosed
    with elders, and savins (junipers) and aldertrees, both large and
    beautiful. They went about in canoes, and made furrows in which they
    planted maize, red-peppers, tomatoes, beans and all kinds of seed that
    we eat.”<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> The location of Aztlan is not a philosophical question
    for our consideration, since scarcely sufficient data of a definite
    character are available on which to base a process of reasoning. The
    report common among the Aztecs was that they had come from the North,
    and this was no doubt true of the final move prior to their settlement
    in Anahuac, but whether it was true of their starting-point and the
    general course of the Aztec migration, is a question which cannot
    be satisfactorily answered. Most Spanish writers and others of the
    earlier school, locate Aztlan directly north of the present boundary
    line of Mexico,<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> others again California,<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> while some favor
    the North-western Mexican States.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> A recent school of Americanists
    assign Aztlan a southern location, placing it in the Central American
    region.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Duran and Brasseur de Bourbourg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span> both celebrated
    authorities, on the other hand locate Aztlan in the United States; the
    former in Florida, by which we are to understand the region of the Gulf
    States,<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> while the latter simply expresses the conviction that
    Aztlan was situated to the north-east of California.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

  <p>The Aztec migration and the itinerary as generally accepted demands
    consideration before forming any judgment on the location of Aztlan.
    In this primitive abode we are told that each year the Aztecs crossed
    a great river or channel to Teo-Culhuacan for the purpose of offering
    sacrifices in honor of their god Tetzauch. But it happened that a
    bird appeared to Huitziton, one of the greatest of their chiefs
    (whom Bancroft thinks was identical with Mecitl or Mexi—hence the
    name Mexicans), and constantly reiterated the word <i>tihui</i>,
    <i>tihui</i>, meaning “let us go, let us go.” This singular occurrence
    was interpreted by Huitziton as a command from the gods for them to
    seek a new country, and after persuading the chief Tecpatzin to his
    view, the divine oracle was announced to the people. Accordingly, in
    the year 1064, according to some authors,<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> or in 1090 according
    to others,<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> or a century later than the first-named date
    according to some of the interpreters of the Aztec migration maps,
    the Nahuatlaca tribes left their ancient home and entered upon one of
    those strange and aimless journeys so characteristic of semi-civilized
    and superstitious peoples. The Aztec migration as given by several
    authorities is scarcely more satisfactory than that of the Toltecs,
    nor can any additional light be thrown on the route pursued until Sr.
    Orozco y Berra publishes the results of his critical examination of the
    subject.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> The unimportance of the itinerary in the solution of any
    question is apparent, since it contributes but little to our knowledge
    of the location of Aztlan.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Bancroft has greatly facilitated the comparison of the lists of
    stations as given by different authors, in a note of great length on
    pp. 322–4, thus presenting to the eye at a glance the diversity of
    opinion which meets the reader of this subject. As an example, we
    select two or three of the itineraries, simply to show the wide range
    that opinion has taken on the subject. According to Veytia, the tribes
    left Aztlan in I Tecpatl, 1064 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and one hundred and four
    years afterwards reached Chicomoztoc, where they dwelt nine years;
    the subsequent stations and the duration of their sojourn in each as
    follows: Cohuatlicamac three years, Matlahuacallan six, Apanco five,
    Chimalco six, Pipiolcomic three, Tollan six, Cohuactepec (Coatepec)
    three, Atlitlalacayan two, Atotonilco one, Tepexic five, Apasco three,
    Tozonpanco seven, Tizayocan one, Ecatepec one, Tolpetlac three,
    Chimalpan four, Cohuatitlan two, Huexachtitlan three, Tecpayocan three,
    Tepeyacac (Guadalupe) three, Pantitlan two, and thence to Chapultepec,
    arriving in 1298, after a journey of one hundred and eighty-five
    years, reckoning an additional forty-nine years for their stay at
    Michoachan.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> According to Tezozomoc, the stations are as follows:
    Aztlan, Culhuacan, Jalisco, Mechoacan, Malinalco (Lake Patzcuaro),
    Ocopipilla, Acahualcingo, Coatepec (in Tonalan), Atlitlanquin, or
    Atitalaquia, Tequisquiac, Atengo, Tzompan, Cuachilgo, Xaltocan, and
    Lake Chnamitl, Eycoac, Ecatepc, Aculhuacan, Tultepetlac, Huixachtitlan,
    Tecpayuca (in two Calli), Atepetlac, Coatlayauhcan, Tetepanco,
    Acolnahuac, Popotla (Tacuba), Chapultepec in two Tochtli.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
    Clavigero states that they left Aztlan in 1160, crossed the Colorado
    River, stayed three years in Hucicolhuacan, went east to Chicomoztoc,
    reached Tula in 1196, and finally Chapultepec in 1245.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Acosta,
    Herrera and Duran state that Nahuatlaca tribes left Aztlan in 820
    <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and eighty years later reached Mexico; that the Aztecs,
    however, did not start until 1122 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Duran identifies
    Aztlan <span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>with Teo-Culhuacan, and locates it towards our Mississippi
    Valley. He in common with other writers identifies Chicomostoc with the
    seven caves.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

  <p>The Tarascos, though speaking a different language, are said to have
    separated from the Nahuatlacas at Michoacan. They describe the route
    to the seven caves as across a sea, which they passed in balsas and
    the trunks of trees.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> This statement may be of some value in
    locating that disputed rendezvous of so many tribes; and certainly
    is more important than a mass of groundless speculation. The next
    source of interest in this connection is the much perverted and sadly
    misunderstood migration map first published by Gemelli Carreri, in
    Churchill’s collection of voyages (vol. iv). Humboldt has given an
    interpretation which, with the exception of that part which connects it
    with a deluge and Colhuacan, “the Ararat of the Mexicans,” is generally
    received.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

  <p>Gemelli Carreri, Humboldt and many others were quite certain that they
    could read in this map the account of the Mosaic deluge.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Don José
    Fernando Ramirez, of the Mexican Museum, however, pointed out the fact
    that the Gemelli Carreri map, copied from one owned by Sigüenza, and
    published by Humboldt, Clavigero and Kingsborough, was in each case
    incorrectly represented, and states that the copy contained in the
    <cite>Atlas</cite> of Garcia y Cubas is the first correct reproduction of the
    original presented to the public.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> Sr. Ramirez explains away the
    illusion of the Mexican Ararat and deluge in a manner both simple and
    conclusive.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> The dove with commas proceeding from its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>beak, is not
    talking, nor giving tongues, but is repeating the word <i>tihui</i>,
    “let us go,” referring to the legend already cited, of the bird in
    Aztlan incessantly uttering this word in the hearing of Huitziton
    the chief. A little bird called <i>tihuitochan</i> is still heard in
    Mexico, having a note which is interpreted by the common people to mean
    the same as their ancestors interpreted it in Aztlan. Sr. Ramirez is
    convinced that the map referred to is only a record of the wanderings
    of the Aztecs among the lakes of the Mexican Valley, and that it has
    no reference whatever to any deluge, not even to one of the former
    traditional destructions of the world found in the Nahua cosmogony. Mr.
    Bancroft has added the valuable argument that the story of Cox-cox and
    the deluge is only the product of false interpretation, or else some
    of the earlier writers would have been acquainted with the legend. On
    the contrary, Olmos, Sahagun, Motolinia, Mendieta, Ixtlilxochitl, and
    Camergo are all silent with regard to it. The mountain and boat and
    their several adjuncts are found to be nothing but hieroglyphics for
    proper names.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

  <p>Chalco Lake is, in the opinion of Señor Ramirez, the point of
    departure for the fifteen chiefs at the end of their first cycle. His
    interpretation of the Boturini map of the migration results in the same
    conclusion. The fifteen chiefs left their island home, passing through
    Coloacan (Colhuacan, according to Gondra’s interpretation) as their
    second station. It appears that the first move and point of departure
    are both unknown, and no satisfactory solution of the question has yet
    been offered. The prevailing tradition that it is in the north has
    been perplexing, since no material remains undoubtedly attributable
    to the Aztecs are found north of the central plateau of Mexico, nor
    indeed in the territories of the United States. If we adopt the general
    theory that the Aztecs came from the Mississippi Valley, possibly the
    original home of the Nahuas, occupied by the Olmecs prior to their
    arrival at Panuco and their descent into the Chiapan region, and by
    the Toltecs before their migration to Anahuac, we have a theory which
    agrees with the testimony of Duran and Sahagun, and seems to find
    support in the pyramidal mounds of the Lower Mississippi, which we
    have already seen are almost as perfect in their plan and construction
    as those found in Mexico, which do not furnish evidence of as great
    antiquity as those of the Ohio and Missouri Valleys. According to most
    accounts, a considerable period elapses between their departure and
    their arrival at Chicomoztoc—the seven caves. According to Veytia it
    was 104 years, but Brasseur adopts twenty-six years, which is also
    the opinion of the majority of writers. Chicomoztoc has some features
    which remind us of the Tulan Zuiva of the Quichés—their seven caves,
    from which so many tribes derived their origin. Chicomoztoc is the
    point at which the six Nahuatlaca tribes separated from the Aztecs, and
    thence proceeded to the Mexican lake region. It is quite probable that
    a considerable distance may have been traversed in this interval of
    twenty-six years, a distance which could have brought the Aztecs from
    a comparatively northern latitude to the Chiapan region. Opposed to
    this, however, is the fact that the Tulan Zuiva of the Quichés was in a
    cold, inhospitable region, no doubt at the North. Mr. Bancroft suggests
    that the first part of the migration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span> tradition may refer vaguely
    back to the events which followed the Toltecs’ destruction.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> We
    have already referred to the tendency to confusion in histories that
    are chiefly traditional. In opposition to the view that Aztlan and
    Chicomoztoc were remote from each of these, we have the statement of
    Duran<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> that these caves are in Teo-Culhuacan, otherwise called
    Aztlan, which implies that both Teo-Culhuacan and Chicomoztoc were
    points in the region of Aztlan. Every year it was the custom of the
    Aztecs, while in Aztlan, to cross a river or channel to Teo-Culhuacan
    in order to sacrifice to their god Tetzauh, and after their arrival
    at Chicomoztoc they continued the occupation of boatmen, which they
    had followed while in Aztlan.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> By way of summary, then, we may
    venture the following: 1. Viewed from the standpoint of Sr. Ramirez,
    Aztlan may be located somewhere not far distant from Chalco Lake. The
    islands which it encircles may correspond to the description of the
    ancient home of the Aztecs, given by Duran as quoted on <a href="#Page_257">page 257</a> and
    described as Culhuacan. Teo-Culhuacan, where the Aztecs sacrificed
    yearly, may be the city of Culhuacan situated in that neighborhood. As
    additional testimony we have the fact that most of the stations named
    in the migrations can be located in the Central Mexican region. The
    report that they came from the north may refer only to the scattering
    of the Nahua or Toltec people from Tollan, just north of the valley.
    2. The statements of all the writers that the Aztecs came from the
    north, the fact that Duran and Sahagun assign the primitive Nahua home
    to the region of Florida, and the prevalence of mounds and shell-heaps
    in great numbers in the Gulf States, together with the extension of
    those mounds through Texas into Mexico, may warrant the opinion that
    Aztlan was in the Mississippi Valley, or, looking in another direction,
    the rock or cave dwellings recently discovered in Southern Utah and
    the Rocky Mountain region (of which we shall give a description in
    the next chapter) may indicate the locality of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>ancient and
    much-sought-for land. The identity in meaning of Chicomoztoc (seven
    caves) and Tulan Zuiva (seven caves) together with the fact that both
    places in Quiché and Nahua history were the point of separation for
    many tribes, is a singular coincidence, if they are not one and the
    same. In the preceding chapter we have seen that Tulan Zuiva of the
    Quichés was in a northern or at least a colder climate, where they
    suffered greatly for want of fire, a fact of no little significance. On
    the other hand Teo-Culhuacan, the place of yearly sacrifice, may have
    been a city of the Chiapan region, since Sahagun located Tamoanchan the
    first city of the Nahuas (Olmec) after their arrival from Florida in
    Mexico, somewhere in the Usumacinta Valley. It is possible that a large
    number of the immigrants remained behind the company which migrated
    northward to Teotihuacan and thence to the seven caves, subsequently
    uniting with the Toltecs at Tollan. This view has had quite a number
    of advocates.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> We will not undertake, in the present state of
    knowledge on the subject, to decide which of these <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>three claims is the
    true one, if either one of them is correct. Our only wish is to furnish
    the reader a margin for his choice. It seems to us that it would be
    unscientific to attempt to decide a question based upon such slender
    and contradictory data.</p>

  <p>It is unnecessary for us to follow the Aztecs farther in their
    history. The magnificent empire of the Montezumas, with its advanced
    civilization, but at the same time cursed with its horrid worship, in
    which thousands of human victims bathed the altars of Mexico yearly
    with their life-blood, has been described and its glory handed down to
    history by that most graceful and romantic of American writers, William
    H. Prescott. We cannot, however, dismiss this the most primitive period
    of the growth of the Nahua nations without a reference to the reputed
    author of the higher phases of their civilization. We refer to that
    semi-mythical and semi-divine personage, Quetzalcoatl. The numerous
    legends concerning this culture-hero, scattered chronologically over
    hundreds of years of Nahua history, may have originated in the life and
    character of some noted personage—the leader and civilizer of the most
    ancient branches of the Nahua family, or in the personification of an
    ideal deity, a nature-god whose chief attribute, whose distinguishing
    office, was the fertilization of the earth, the revivification of the
    slumbering forces in nature and consequently the author of prosperity,
    agriculture, and the arts of peace. In either case the name of the
    original Quetzalcoatl, were he either man or deity, was eventually
    inherited by a line of individuals who became the priests of his
    worship, or the representatives of his teachings, and the inculcators
    of the most humane and noble principles which entered into the ancient
    civilization. Without entering into a lengthy discussion of the
    probabilities in the case, we give the substance of the traditions,
    arranged in what appears to us not only the most consistent, but also
    the proper order. We have already acquainted the reader with the
    meaning of Quetzalcoatl, namely, “plumed serpent.”</p>

  <p>From the distant East, from the fabulous Hue hue Tlapalan, this
    mysterious personage came to Tulla, and became the patron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> god and
    high-priest of the ancestors of the Toltecs.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> He is described
    as having been a white man, with a strong formation of body, broad
    forehead, large eyes, and flowing beard. He wore a mitre on his head,
    and was dressed in a long, white robe, reaching to his feet, and
    covered with red crosses. In his hand he held a sickle. His habits were
    ascetic; he never married, was most chaste and pure in his life, and
    is said to have endured penance in a neighboring mountain, not for its
    effects upon himself, but as an example to others. Some have here found
    a parallel for Christ’s temptation. He condemned sacrifices, except
    of fruits and flowers, and was known as the god of peace; for when
    addressed on the subject of war, he is reported to have stopped his
    ears with his fingers.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

  <p>Quetzalcoatl was skilled in many arts, having invented gem-cutting
    and metal-casting. He furthermore originated letters and invented the
    Mexican calendar. The legend which describes the latter states that the
    gods, having made men, thought it advisable that their creatures should
    have some means of reckoning time, and of regulating the order of
    religious ceremonies. Therefore two of these celestial personages, one
    of them a goddess, called Quetzalcoatl to counsel with them, and the
    three contrived a system which they recorded on tables, each bearing
    a single sign. That sign, however, was accompanied with all necessary
    explanations of its meaning. It is noticeable that the goddess was
    assigned the privilege of writing the first sign, and that she chose a
    serpent as her favorite symbol.</p>

  <p>Some accounts represent that Huemac was the temporal king, or at least
    associated with Quetzalcoatl in the government; the latter occupying
    the priestly as well as the kingly office. Sahagun <span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>calls the associate
    ruler Vemac. At all events, Quetzalcoatl had an enemy, the deity
    Tezcatlipoca, whose worship was quite opposite in its character to
    that of Quetzalcoatl, being sanguine and celebrated with horrid human
    sacrifices. A struggle ensued in Tulla (Tollan) between the opposing
    systems which resulted favorably to the bloody deity and the faction
    who sought to establish his worship in preference to the peaceful and
    ascetic service of Quetzalcoatl.</p>

  <p>Tezcatlipoca, envious of the magnificence enjoyed by Quetzalcoatl,
    determined upon his destruction. His first appearance at Tulla was
    in the <i>rôle</i> of a great ball-player, and Quetzalcoatl, being
    very fond of the game, engaged in play with him, when suddenly he
    transformed himself into a tiger, occasioning a panic among the
    spectators, in which great numbers were crowded over a precipice into
    a river, where they perished. Again the vicious god appeared at Tulla.
    This time he presented himself at the door of Quetzalcoatl’s palace in
    the guise of an old man, and asked permission of the servants to see
    their master. They attempted to drive him away, saying that their god
    was ill. At last, because of his importunities, they obtained leave to
    admit him.</p>

  <p>Tezcatlipoca entered, and seeing the sick deity, asked about his
    health, and announced that he had brought him a medicine which would
    ease his body, compose his mind, and prepare him for the journey which
    Fate had decreed that he must undertake.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Quetzalcoatl received the
    sorcerer kindly, inquiring anxiously as to the journey and the land of
    his destiny. His deceiver told him that the name of the land was Tullan
    Tlapalan, where his youth would be renewed, and that he must visit it
    without delay. The sick king was moved greatly by the words of the
    sorcerer, and was prevailed upon to taste the intoxicating medicine
    which he pressed to his lips. At once he felt his malady healed, and
    the desire to depart fixed itself in his mind.</p>

  <p>“Drink again!” exclaimed the old sorcerer; and again the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>god-king
    pressed the cup to his lips, and drank till the thought of departure
    became indelible, chained his reason, and speedily drove him a wanderer
    from his palace and kingdom.</p>

  <p>Upon leaving Tulla, driven from his kingdom by the vicious enmity
    of Tezcatlipoca, he ordered his palaces of gold, and silver, and
    turquoise, and precious stones, to be set on fire. The myriads of
    rich-plumed songsters that made the air of the capital melodious with
    song accompanied him on his journey, pipers playing on pipes preceded
    him, and the flowers by the way are said to have given forth unusual
    volumes of perfume at his approach.</p>

  <p>After journeying one hundred leagues southward, he rested, near a city
    of Anahuac, under a great tree, and as a memorial of the event, he cast
    stones at the tree, lodging them in its trunk.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

  <p>He then proceeded still farther southward in the same valley, until he
    came to a mountain, two leagues distant from the city of Mexico. Here
    he pressed his hands upon a rock on which he rested, and left their
    prints imbedded in it, where they remained visible down to a very
    recent date. He then turned eastward to Cholula, where he was received
    with greatest reverence.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> The great pyramid was erected to his
    honor. With his advent the spirit of peace settled down upon the city.
    War was not known during his sojourn within it. The reign of Saturn
    repeated itself. The enemies of the Cholulans came with perfect safety
    to his temple, and many wealthy princes of other countries erected
    temples to his honor in the city of his choice.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

  <p>Here the silversmith, the sculptor, the artist, and the architect, we
    are led to believe, from the testimony of both tradition and remains,
    flourished under the patronage of the grand god-king.</p>

  <p>However, after twenty years had elapsed, that subtile, feverish draught
    received from the hand of Tezcatlipoca away back in Tulla, like an old
    poison in the veins, renewed its power. Again his people, his palaces,
    and his pyramidal temple were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>forsaken, that he might start on his
    long and final journey.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> He told his priests that the mysterious
    Tlapalla was his destination, and turning toward the East, proceeded
    on his way until he reached the sea at a point a few miles south of
    Vera Cruz. Here he bestowed his blessing upon four young men, who
    accompanied him from Cholula, and commanded them to go back to their
    homes, bearing the promise to his people that he would return to them,
    and again set up his kingdom among them. Then, embarking in a canoe
    made of serpent-skins, he sailed away into the East.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

  <p>The Cholulans, out of respect to Quetzalcoatl, placed the government in
    the hands of the recipients of his blessing. His statue was placed in
    a sanctuary on the pyramid, but in a reclining position, representing
    a state of repose, with the understanding that it shall be placed upon
    its feet when the god returns. When Cortés landed, they believed their
    hopes realized, sacrificed a man to him, and sprinkled the blood of the
    unhappy victim upon the conqueror and his companions.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

  <p>Father Sahagun, when on his journey to Mexico, was everywhere asked
    if he had not come from Tlapalla.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> No wonder when the fleet of
    Cortés hove in sight on the horizon, almost in the same place where
    Quetzalcoatl’s bark had disappeared, that the Mexican, who had been
    waiting centuries for the prince of peace to return, believed his
    waiting to be at an end. No wonder that he inquired of the distant and
    mysterious Tlapalla. In this state of expectancy we find a most natural
    and fruitful soil for the operations of the Spanish conquerors.</p>

  <p>Such is the form into which the mass of legends concerning
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>Quetzalcoatl have been woven. There is scarcely a doubt, however, that
    it is a matter of growth—is the accumulation of several centuries.
    The name Quetzalcoatl (Nahua), Gucumatz (Quiché) and Cukulcan (Maya),
    translated “feathered” or “plumed” or “winged” serpent, may originally
    have been applied to an intelligent princely foreigner who was cast
    upon the shores of the Central American region, and who introduced the
    art of casting metals, and especially taught agriculture. His doctrines
    of peace and virtue may have been sufficiently wide-spread to have
    brought about the prosperity which is ascribed to his age. From this
    standpoint we would consider him at first to have cast his lot among
    the descendants of Votan, otherwise known as the “Serpents,” from which
    occurrence he may have received his name of “Feathered Serpent.” On
    <a href="#Page_241">pages 241–42</a> we referred to the statements of the Codex Chimalpopoca,
    that Quetzalcoatl, becoming obnoxious to his companions, who seem to
    be Quichés, forsook them. The account also states that he afterwards
    brought maize to Tamoanchan (the city of the Nahuas). Our next account
    of him describes him as figuring among the Olmecs at Cholula. This
    realistic view of the tradition applies to the first Quetzalcoatl,
    who may have been an actual man. While entertaining this view, we
    must not forget that centuries prior to this period (which we may as
    well assign to the first or second century as to any other date), the
    Quichés possessed the ideal of such a personage whom they considered
    a deity, who figures so actively in their cosmogony under the name of
    Gucumatz. This deity was the vivifying force in nature, the bringer of
    the gentle south winds, the god of the harvest and of the air. He was
    best symbolized to the mind of the savage by the vernal shower and the
    return of spring.</p>

  <p>The serpent was everywhere considered an emblem of the vernal shower,
    and was thought to be in some way instrumental in bringing it, together
    with its refreshing and fructifying influences. So here, in the name of
    Quetzalcoatl, we find a progressive step indicated in the workings of
    the mind, an advance from the lower figure of the serpent alone to that
    of an aërial combination, which, while it contained all the virtues of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
    the serpent, is lifted to a higher element—that from which the shower
    falls. The feathery vapor-clouds of summer are but the plumes or wings
    of the shower which the serpent symbolized.</p>

  <p>At last when a teacher of agriculture and the mechanic arts, so
    conducive of prosperity and plenty, appeared—an individual who
    discovers maize and directs the process of its reproduction and guards
    an improvident people against want and famine, the attributes of the
    god are recognized as dwelling in him, the ideal vaguely represented
    by the vernal shower is concreted, is become incarnate, is presented
    in a shape more comprehensible to the untaught mind, and at once the
    name, reverence and worship of the god are attached to the man, the
    culture-hero. This we believe to be the simplest interpretation of the
    origin of the worship of Quetzalcoatl. A priesthood appears to have
    been founded who perpetuated the doctrines of this deified man. That
    part of the legend which relates to Tulla (Tollan) with the expulsion
    of the king and that which followed, properly belongs to Ceacatl,
    surnamed Quetzalcoatl, Toltec king of Tollan, who ascended the throne
    about 873.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> The father of this monarch had been cruelly murdered,
    and in his early boyhood Ceacatl is said to have wreaked a terrible
    vengeance on the murderer of his father, after which he concealed
    himself for about twenty years. At about the above-named date he
    reappeared, and established his claims to the throne. He espoused the
    religion of Quetzalcoatl, and the peace which followed brought great
    prosperity. Human sacrifices were forbidden, and a golden age seemed
    to dawn in which Tollan exceeded all the cities of the Mexican valley
    in importance and wealth. But a rivalry at once sprang up between the
    priests of the bloody god Tezcatlipoca, worshipped in Culhuacan and at
    Teotihuacan, and those of the peaceful and humane Quetzalcoatl, which
    resulted in the voluntary departure of the Pontiff king, to whom the
    name of his god was attached. The contest between the two sects is
    symbolized in the legend by the tricks of Tezcatlipoca. Quetzalcoatl
    was received at Cholula, where he remained some years, but was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>at last
    driven away before the leader of the Tezcatlipoca faction, namely,
    King Huemac, who advanced upon the peaceful king with a strong army.
    Quetzalcoatl again voluntarily withdrew, rather than occasion the
    bloodshed of his subjects. It is probable that he ultimately reached
    Yucatan and figured there in his old character under the name of
    Cukulcan.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

  <p class="drop-cap">IN the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, and in our Territories of Arizona,
    New Mexico, Utah and the State of Colorado, a class of remains are
    found, wholly unlike those of the Mayas, Nahuas, or Mound-builders,
    though in some instances they are associated with earthworks resembling
    those of the latter race. The style of architecture is unlike that of
    any other people on either continent, and though varying considerably
    in its individual examples, still present certain marked and general
    features which leave little room for doubt that the peoples of the
    Pueblos and the Cliffs were the same. The earliest discovered of
    this class of remains are known as the Casas Grandes, situated at
    about half a mile from the modern town of the same name, in the
    fertile valley of the Casas Grandes or San Migual River in Northern
    Chihuahua. These ruins have often been described second-hand and their
    nature is well-known to persons interested in this field of inquiry.
    Of the above-named class of descriptions, the latest and best is
    by Mr. Bancroft, who has added a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span> bibliographical apparatus to his
    account.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> We will, therefore, confine our discussion of this group
    of remains to the essential facts as given by Mr. J. R. Bartlett, whose
    account of his researches is quite full and satisfactory.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> These
    facts we will give as briefly as possible, preferring to devote our
    space to the new material composing the latter part of the chapter.
    Several of the early writers refer to the Casas Grandes as one of the
    Aztec stations; but a little intelligent study of the characteristics
    of the ruins, especially in the light of recent explorations in
    the Territories, is likely to dissipate such an opinion. The first
    examination of the ruins of which any reliable record is left, was by
    Sr. Escudero, in 1819, published in his <cite>Noticias Estadísticas del
    Estado de Chihuahua</cite>. A contributor to the <cite>Album Mexicano</cite>
    (tom. i, pp. 374–5) furnished a good account of the ruins as he
    found them in 1842. None of the hasty sketches subsequently made by
    several writers are worth a reference until we come to the excellent
    description written by Mr. Bartlett in 1851, while acting as United
    States Commissioner, in fixing the United States and Mexican boundary
    line. The Casas Grandes, according to Mr. Bartlett, are built of adobe
    or mud, in large quadrangular blocks measuring about twenty-two inches
    in thickness by three feet or more in length. The irregularity of the
    length of the blocks, however, seemed to indicate that they had been
    formed on the wall, <i>in situ</i>, by means of a box open at the ends,
    which, when the block dried, was moved along to mould a fresh block.
    The mud is filled with coarse gravel from the plateau, which gives
    greater hardness to the material. The Casas face the cardinal points
    and consist of erect and fallen walls, ranging from five to thirty
    feet in height. The accumulation of rubbish is, however, considerable,
    and if the highest standing walls rest upon a common level with the
    lowest, they will measure from forty to fifty feet in height. The
    edifice was discovered in ruins by the conquerors, and could not have
    been occupied for a century, at the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>least calculation, prior to its
    discovery. It is, therefore, reasonable to presume that all the walls
    now standing were originally much higher than at present. It appears
    that the outer portions of the edifices were the lowest, and not more
    than one story in height, while the central ones were from three to
    six stories. The central or inner walls are better preserved, partly
    by their greater thickness—five feet at the base—and partly by the
    heaps of ruined walls which have fallen around them. Once prostrate,
    the blocks absorb the water, and in a few years are reduced to a mass
    of mud and gravel. It was with difficulty that Mr. Bartlett traced all
    the outlines of the buildings; but close examination revealed the fact
    that three lofty edifices were connected into one by means of a low
    range of buildings, one storey high, which may have merely inclosed
    intervening courts. The total length of this continuous edifice was
    at least 800 feet by 250 feet wide. A regular and continuous wall was
    observed on the south side, while the eastern and western fronts, with
    their projecting walls, were very irregular. The question of the exact
    number of stories is not capable of solution, as no vestige of timbers
    or wood now remains. The explorer could not even detect a trace of
    any cavities where the floor-timbers had been inserted in the walls,
    so decayed and washed was their condition. Many doorways remained,
    but the lintels having decayed, the tops had fallen in. Clavigero
    states that the edifice had “three floors with a terrace above them
    and without any entrance to the under floor, so that a scaling ladder
    is necessary.” García Condé confirms this statement as to the three
    stories besides a roof,<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> while both authors consider this to have
    been a station on the Aztec migration. Certainly, no architectural
    analogies with the remains farther south justify this opinion. Mr.
    Bartlett was unable to obtain but a partial plan of the Casas Grandes.

    </span>
    One class of apartments, however, attracted his especial attention,
    from the fact that they were evidently designed for granaries. They
    were arranged along one <span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>of the main walls, and measured twenty feet in
    length by ten in breadth. They were connected by doorways “with a small
    inclosure or pen in one corner, three or four feet high.” Numerous long
    and narrow apartments, too contracted for sleeping or dwelling-rooms,
    lighted by circular apertures in the upper walls, are supposed to have
    been devoted to the same use. Large inclosures, too extensive in their
    dimensions ever to have been roofed, evidently were used as courts.
    Two hundred feet west of the Casas, on the plateau, are the remains of
    a building about 150 feet square, divided into compartments, as shown
    in the accompanying plan:
    <span class="figleft2 illowp28">

      <span class="xxsmall bold">GROUND PLAN OF ONE OF THE CASAS GRANDES AT CHIHUAHUA.</span>
    </span>
    Between this edifice and the main building,
    are three mounds of loose stones about fifteen feet high, which the
    explorers did not have time to open. For a distance of twenty leagues
    and covering an area of ten leagues wide along the Casas Grandes and
    Janos Rivers, according to García Condé, are ruins resembling small
    mounds, from which jars, pottery in various forms, painted with white,
    blue and scarlet colors, corn-grinders (metates), and stone-axes have
    been taken. If this region was ever occupied by the Aztecs, even
    temporarily, this latter class of remains might more properly be
    attributed to them, than the Casas Grandes. Innumerable fragments of
    pottery, superior to that now manufactured by the Mexicans, are strewn
    everywhere in the neighborhood of the Casas Grandes. The decoration is
    in black, red or brown, on a white or reddish ground. Several graceful
    and highly artistic vases have been collected about the ruins, and
    stone metates, nicely hewn, have been recovered in perfect condition.
    On the summit of the highest mountain, ten miles south-west of the
    ruins, stands an ancient fortress of stone, the walls of which are
    said by the writer in the <cite>Album Mexicano</cite> to have been from
    eighteen to twenty feet thick. The fort, which is attributed to the
    occupants of the Casas Grandes, was two or three stories, and in the
    centre had a high mound for the purposes of observation. Clavigero, who
    describes the fort and all of the ruins from hearsay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span> falls into the
    error of supposing the Casas to have also been constructed of stone. A
    short distance from the point where the 111° (meridian) of longitude
    crosses the Gila River, in Southern Arizona, in the valley occupied
    farther westward by the Pima villages, stands the most famous ruin of
    all the Western remains. The Casa Grande, otherwise named the Casa de
    Montezuma, has attracted the attention of and furnished a fruitful
    subject for most writers on Mexican antiquity, the majority of whom,
    however, have contributed nothing to our knowledge of the history or
    uses of the edifice. Of describers at second-hand, Mr. Bancroft has
    cited thirty-four authors, according to our reckoning, and to this
    number the reader must add that author’s account and ours. This fact
    is an admonition to us to confine ourselves to the briefest possible
    statement of facts, for certainly the thirty-sixth repetition of
    the accounts furnished by two or three original explorers would be
    altogether inexcusable, were it not for the inseparable relation of the
    Gila Casas to the remains to be described farther on. Mr. Bancroft has
    treated the bibliography of the subject in his usually comprehensive
    manner,<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> and it only remains for us to refer the reader to the
    original descriptions. The first of these was written by Padre Mange,
    the secretary of Padre Kino, on the latter’s tour of visitation to
    the missions of the region in 1697.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Lieutenant C. M. Bernal, of
    the same expedition, adds also a description.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Padre Sedelmair,
    who visited the ruin in 1744, copies literally Mange’s description
    in his account of the Casas.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Father Font, who, in company with
    Father Garcés, made an expedition conducted by Captain Anza to the
    Gila and the missions farther north, left a diary—now preserved in
    the original, in the archives at Guadalajara—from which Mr. Bartlett
    translated and published an extensive description<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> of the Casas.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
    Of later writers, only four wrote from personal observation, namely,
    Emory<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> and Johnston,<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> of General Kearney’s Military Expedition
    to California in 1846; Bartlett<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> in 1852, and Ross Browne in
    1863.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> These are the only original sources of information on the
    Casa Grande of the Gila, of which Bartlett’s account may be said to
    be the best. However, Bancroft has contributed much to facilitate the
    study of the subject by his addition of a full literary apparatus.</p>

  <p>From all of these we draw the facts without further citation. Two and
    a half miles south of the Gila, on a slightly elevated plateau, stands
    the remains of the Casa Grande surrounded with a growth of mesquite
    trees. The ascent from the river bottom is so slight and gradual that
    its former inhabitants had constructed acequias between the river and
    the buildings. Mr. Bartlett found three edifices within a space of
    one hundred and fifty yards. The larger one only was in a fair state
    of preservation. Its four outer walls and most of the inner ones were
    standing. Three storeys were plainly marked by the ends of the beams
    remaining in the walls or by the cavities which they once occupied. No
    doubt the building was one story, at least, higher than this indicated,
    as the upper walls have crumbled away considerably and filled the first
    story with disintegrated adobe and a mass of rubbish. The central
    portion or tower furthermore rises eight or ten feet higher than the
    outer walls, and may have formed another story above the main building.
    At their base, the walls are between four or five feet in thickness,
    rising perpendicular on the inside, but on the outside tapering towards
    the top in a curved line.</p>

  <p>The material of the walls consists of blocks of adobe, prepared as in
    the Casas Grandes of Chihuahua, in position on the walls, probably
    in boxes two feet high and four feet long; after the mud had dried
    sufficiently, the box was moved further along the walls and refilled.
    Some difference of opinion has existed as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>to the color of the mud
    employed, though all admit it to be that of the surrounding valley.
    Mr. Bancroft gives some attention to this point, and observes that
    Bernal pronounced it “white clay,” and that according to Johnston it
    is also white with an admixture of lime from the vicinity. Mr. Hutton,
    a civil engineer who had thoroughly examined them, reported to Mr.
    Simpson that the surrounding earth was of a reddish color, but the
    admixture of pebbles with the mud gave the Casa a whitish appearance in
    certain reflections. Mr. Bancroft seeks by this argument to identify
    this building with Castañeda’s Chichilticale, which is described as
    having been built of red earth.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> The outer sides of the walls were
    finished with a plaster similar to that which composed the blocks,
    but the inner side was covered with hard finish of such fine quality
    that when visited they still retained their polish after centuries of
    exposure. It is estimated that the edifice must have stood a hundred
    years at least prior to its discovery by the Spaniards. The inner walls
    are slightly thinner than the outer ones, and divide the building
    into five apartments, as shown in Mr. Bartlett’s ground plan. The
    building measures fifty feet in length by forty in width.
    <span class="figright2 illowp28">

      <span class="xxsmall bold smcap0">Ground Plan.</span>
    </span>
    The three central rooms indicated are each about eight by fourteen feet, while
    those at each end of the edifice are ten by about thirty-two feet. The
    doorways indicated in the plan are three feet wide by five feet high,
    except that in the western façade, which is only two feet wide and
    seven or eight feet high. The main part of the edifice was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>probably
    thirty feet high, while the tower rose still ten feet higher. Padre
    Kino found a floor in an adjoining ruin still perfect, the supporting
    timbers of which were round and about five inches in diameter, while
    the floor proper was formed by placing cross-sticks on the joist and
    covering them with a layer of adobe. Mr. Browne observed the marks of
    a blunt axe still plainly visible in the timbers of cedar or sabine
    which had been thus employed, while their charred ends furnish the
    only clue to the cause of the ruin of the edifice, a fact suggestive
    of the ravages of the savage Apaches. No stairways or other means of
    ascent were discovered, and it is inferred that ladders were employed
    upon the outside as among the modern Pueblos. Near the main building,
    to the south-west, Mr. Bartlett discovered another Casa in ruins,
    and with difficulty traced its ground plan; while a third was so
    completely decayed as to leave no certain outline of its form. To the
    north-west about two hundred yards, was a circular embankment eighty
    or one hundred yards in circumference, which Mr. Bartlett supposes to
    have been used as a stock inclosure. A few yards farther north Mr.
    Johnston observed a terrace, two hundred by three hundred feet and
    five feet high, and having a summit platform seventy-two feet square,
    from which an excellent view of the valley is afforded. This monument
    is unlike any other found among the New Mexican remains. The entire
    valley is strewn with heaps of rubbish and ruined adobe edifices, which
    indicate that once the whole region was thickly populated by this
    remarkable people. Mr. Bartlett found broken metates (corn-grinders),
    and innumerable fragments of pottery painted tastefully with red,
    white, lead color, and black. The figures were geometrical, and many
    of the vessels had been decorated on the inside—a practice not in
    vogue with the modern peoples of the Gila Valley. The finish was also
    far superior to that of modern pottery. The Casa Grande, when last
    observed by Mr. Browne, was fast going to pieces, the moisture having
    undermined some parts of the outer walls, which were only kept erect by
    their great thickness. In 1873, Mr. Bancroft learned that the edifice
    was still standing, but it is evident that it must soon share the fate
    of its fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span> neighbors. It is certain that this Pueblo civilization
    spread itself over a large tract of country north of the Gila Valley
    in the basin of the Rio Salado or Salinas, the principal tributary of
    the Gila. Numerous buildings similar to those previously described,
    have been noticed by different writers on the Rio Salado and its
    tributaries. The ruins of large edifices surrounded by smaller ones are
    described by Sedelmair (discovered in 1744) as standing between the
    Gila and Salado.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

      (As sketched by Ross Browne in 1863.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>Velarde has also cited the remains of similar structures at the
    junction of Salado and Verde and of the Salado and Gila.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> We cannot
    refer to all of the remains reported in this region, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>especially
    since most of them are indescribable and shapeless heaps of ruins.
    One edifice, however, was observed by Mr. Bartlett, two hundred feet
    in length by sixty or eighty feet in width; and from the accumulation
    of debris, it is estimated that the edifice must have been three or
    four stories in height. This was but one of several similar heaps
    of ruins observed in the immediate vicinity. This locality, distant
    thirty-five miles from the river’s mouth, was evidently at one time
    the site of a populous city. The remains of numerous works, probably
    of a public character, such as irrigating canals—one of which is now
    more than twenty feet wide and four feet deep and several miles long,
    in the construction of which it was necessary to cut down the bank
    of the plateau—occur in considerable numbers. The whole region is
    strewn with fragments of broken pottery of fine workmanship.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> M.
    Leroux, in 1854, discovered on the Rio Verde ruins of stone houses and
    regular fortifications which did not appear to have been occupied for
    centuries. The walls were of solid masonry of rectangular form, usually
    from twenty to thirty paces in length, and the style of architecture
    similar to that of the Casa Grande of the Gila. Still there was
    sufficient resemblance to the Pueblos of the Moquis to indicate a
    transition from the southern to the northern style of Pueblo dwelling.
    The sudden change in the material employed—that from adobe to stone in
    large blocks, well hewn—is rather remarkable. The ruins are found with
    more or less continuity between Fort McDowell and Prescott.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Mr.
    Bancroft, after citing the above, expresses regret at his inability
    to secure information in the possession of officers in the Arizona
    service.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

  <p>Lieutenant Whipple describes extensive ruins on the small streams
    forming the head-waters of the Rio Verde. Both stone and adobe
    structures were numerous, and the walls usually were found to be about
    five feet thick.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Emory has described some <span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>Pueblo buildings
    of singular structure on the upper Gila and its tributaries; most
    interesting of these is one with a labyrinthine plan of inner circular
    walls. The region also abounds in rock inscriptions of a rude though no
    doubt conventional character.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> It is quite natural to suppose that
    remains of this ancient people would have been found extensively on
    the greatest river of the region—the Colorado. Mr. Bancroft passes the
    subject with the statement that “no relics of antiquity are reported by
    reliable authorities,” and fitly explains that it is unlikely, in view
    of the peculiarity of the region, that none will ever be found in the
    immediate vicinity of the river.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Whipple and his associates state
    that “upon the lower part of the Rio Colorado no traces of permanent
    dwellings have been discovered.”<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

  <p>Since the publication of Mr. Bancroft’s fourth volume, the public
    has been made acquainted with the details of Major J. W. Powell’s
    exploration of the Grand Cañon of the Colorado.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> The descent of the
    river was accomplished by the Major and his companions in the summer
    of 1869, amid dangers so appalling and privations so distressing,
    that we need not hesitate in pronouncing it an exhibition of heroism
    having few parallels in the history of exploration. The Major has since
    repeated his perilous journey of which we have enjoyed the pleasure
    of a verbal description in part from the explorer himself. Groups
    of ruins were discovered in the gloomy depths of the Grand Cañon at
    three different points. In referring to them we will reverse the order
    in which they were discovered. A hundred or more miles (for we are
    unable to estimate the distance from the account) above the Virgen
    River, where the granite walls rise perpendicularly from the water’s
    edge thousands of feet, the cañon widened somewhat and a considerable
    group of ruined buildings were discovered on a terrace of trap. There
    had evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> been quite a village in that solitary spot, shut in
    by hundreds of miles of granite walls either up or down the river’s
    course. Mealing stones and fragments of broken pottery were scattered
    about the ruins, and so many beautiful flint chips that the discoverers
    conjectured that it might have been the home of an ancient arrow-maker.
    Major Powell found on a natural shelf in the rock, back of the ruin,
    a globular basket, badly broken, and so decayed that when taken up it
    fell to pieces.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Some distance farther up the river, the grim walls
    of more than a mile in height parted to admit the clear waters of a
    stream named by the explorers “Bright Angel River.” In a little gulch
    above the creek the foundations of two or three Pueblo houses were
    discovered. They were built of irregular cut stones, laid in mortar.
    An old, deeply-worn mealing stone and a great quantity of pottery were
    found, and old trails were observed worn into the rock.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

  <p>It cannot fail, however, to excite the wonder of the reader to learn
    that Major Powell found ruined pueblos hundreds of miles <span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>farther up
    that dismal, almost subterranean river. Not far below the foot of the
    Cataract Cañon, and a considerable distance above Escalante River, in
    Southern Utah, the explorers discovered on a wall two hundred feet
    above the river, but removed from the water by a narrow plain, an old
    stone house of good masonry. The stones were laid in mortar with much
    regularity. It had been a three-story building, the first of which
    still remained in good condition, the second being much broken, and
    but little being left of the third. Flint chips, beautiful arrow-heads
    and broken pottery abounded in the vicinity. The faces of the cliffs
    were also covered with etchings. Fifteen miles farther down the river
    another group was discovered, the principal building of which was in
    the shape of an L, with five rooms on the ground floor; one in the
    angle and two in each wing. In the centre of the angle there was a deep
    excavation, doubtless an underground chamber for religious services,
    known as an Estufa. Major Powell considers these remains the work of a
    branch of the people now occupying the province of Tusayan in northern
    Arizona. These Moqui peoples will be noticed farther on. In the
    neighborhood of the last-named ruin, the Major found a tall, pyramidal
    work of nature, formed by smooth rock-mounds, rising one above another.
    On climbing this he observed that this natural eminence had been used
    as an outlook by the people of the Pueblo. A stairway cut in the rock
    by human hands and an old ladder resting against a perpendicular rock
    were discovered.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

  <p>The Colorado Chiquito and its tributaries flows through the very heart
    of the Pueblo country. One hundred miles above its junction with the
    Rio Colorado, Whipple, Sitgreaves and others, found numerous ruins,
    crowning nearly every prominent point in the valley. The pottery of
    the region is unlike that usually met with, in that it is ornamented
    with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>impressions and raised work, instead of being painted.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Forty
    miles farther up the river colossal ruins were discovered standing on
    the summit of a sandstone bluff. The walls, such as remained standing,
    were ten feet thick, while the building measured 360 feet in length by
    120 in width.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> With the exception of the remains of stone-houses,
    at the junction of the Rio Puerco with the Colorado Chiquito, the
    only aboriginal remains reported are pottery, scattered arrow-heads
    and numerous rock inscriptions. The next tributary of the Colorado
    Chiquito—the Zuñi River—is celebrated because of its ancient and modern
    Pueblo structures. For fifty miles from the mouth of the Zuñi, the
    antiquarian who could, might read the history of this ancient people,
    spread out upon the imperishable cliffs—the parchment of Nature’s
    children. Within eight miles of the inhabited Pueblo towns, numerous
    ruins are encountered.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Here, within a few miles, the almost
    mythical “seven cities of Cibola,” described by Coronado in 1540, and
    by Marco de Niça the year previous, are demonstrated to have been
    situated.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Zuñi itself is the Granada of the devoted and romantic
    conquerors. In the centre of a plain upon a commanding eminence, stands
    the inhabited Pueblo of Zuñi. Its frontage is upon the river of the
    same name, while but a short distance in the background, the mesa
    terminates in tall cliffs of metamorphic rock several hundred feet
    high. The town is built in blocks, with terrace-shaped houses, usually
    three stories high, in which the lower stories do service as the
    platform for those immediately following them. Access is obtained by
    means of ladders reaching to the roof or terrace, formed upon the first
    story of each of the houses. The town is very compactly built, many
    of the streets passing under the upper stories of houses. The whole
    is divided into four squares, and the houses in each are continuously
    joined <span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>together. The building material employed is stone, plastered
    with mud.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> A little more than two miles south-east of Zuñi, the
    ancient ruined Pueblo of the same name is situated on an elevated
    mesa of a mile in width, the precipitous descent from which, upon all
    sides, measures a thousand feet. The ruins of old Zuñi are surrounded
    with a growth of cedars, and cover several acres of ground. The walls,
    constructed of small sandstone blocks laid in mud-mortar, are only
    eighteen inches thick and are sadly dilapidated from age, only twelve
    feet marking their highest point of present elevation. Still, there
    is a deeper mystery about this antiquated ruin, for beneath the walls
    now standing, others are found of a more ancient city, whose walls
    were six feet thick, which perished either of age or by the hand of
    the destroyer, before the present was begun. The ascent to the ruin
    is a winding and difficult path, guarded with stone battlements at
    different points. At a sacred spring near Zuñi, Whipple found vases
    standing inverted upon an adobe wall. “Many of these were white,
    well-proportioned, and of elegant forms. Upon their inner and outward
    surfaces they were curiously painted to represent frogs, tadpoles,
    tortoises, butterflies, and rattlesnakes.” The tufted snakes on one
    of the vases are pronounced almost unique in America.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Twelve
    miles above Zuñi, at Ojo del Pescado, four or five ruined towns are
    found, but so badly decayed as to furnish little clue to their plan.
    Two of them, however, are constructed elliptically around a spring,
    and present a circumference of about 800 to 1000 feet. Two-thirds of a
    mile down the river, ruined pueblos in a fair state of preservation,
    with two stories standing, are described as covering an area of
    150 by 200 yards. At the time of Möllhausen’s visit, the roofs and
    fire-places were in quite good condition.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>A square estufa, still
    under roof, and numerous rock inscriptions, were observed. In this
    instance we are furnished with abundant evidence that the destruction
    of this people never was a wholesale one, but that gradually they are
    succumbing to their unpropitious surroundings—a land which is fast
    becoming a howling wilderness, with its scourging sands and roaming
    savage Bedouin—the Apaches. One more locality in this region merits
    attention. Eighteen miles south-east of the sources of the Zuñi River,
    stands a sandstone rock three hundred feet high, which at a distance
    resembles a Moorish fortress. The Spaniards named it El Moro. It is
    also known as “Inscription Rock,” because of the Spanish and Indian
    inscriptions which cover its smooth face. Simpson has copied some of
    them, which is quite fortunate, since later explorers have found many
    of them almost effaced. The ruins of two buildings are found on the
    summit, which is reached by a difficult path. The large group is in
    the form of a rectangle, measuring 307 by 206 feet. The walls, faced
    with sandstone blocks, remain standing to the height of six and eight
    feet. The other group is separated from the first by a deep ravine,
    and is found upon the very brink of the outer precipice. A circular
    estufa thirty-one feet in diameter was also noticed. Cedar timbers
    were found in the walls, and broken pottery in abundance.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> About
    one hundred miles in a north north-easterly direction from Zuñi, in
    longitude 108° and latitude 36°, the most remarkable of the pueblo
    ruins are situated. These are on the north bank of the Chaco River,
    a tributary of the Rio San Juan, a stream the affluents of which are
    noted for a greater number of pueblo and cliff-dwellers’ ruins than
    are found elsewhere. Lieutenant Simpson has described the ruins of the
    Chaco, eleven in number, occurring within a distance of twenty-five
    miles. The first of these met with in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>coming from the south is called
    at present (we presume in the absence of the knowledge of the true
    name) the Pueblo Pintado. The most remarkable feature of this great
    structure is the beauty and precision of the masonry. The fine, hard
    gray sandstone blocks are quite uniformly three inches in thickness and
    are laid without mortar, always breaking joints. The crevices between
    the ends of the blocks are filled with very thin pieces of stone, not
    over a quarter of an inch thick. The walls of the pueblo now standing,
    are at their greatest height, thirty feet, and furnish evidence from
    the marks of the floor-timbers that the building was three stories. The
    walls are between two and three feet thick at the base, though this is
    diminished with each succeeding story by a jog of a few inches, upon
    which the flooring timbers rest. These are from six to eleven inches in
    diameter, always of uniform size in the same room. On these beams small
    round sticks are laid transversely, and these in turn covered with thin
    cedar strips, lying transversely of the round sticks. In some rooms the
    chinks in the floor were filled with small stones and the whole covered
    with a layer of mortar. One room, however, had a floor of smooth cedar
    boards, seven inches wide and three-quarters of an inch thick. The
    edges and ends were squarely cut, and their smooth surfaces indicate
    that they were polished by being rubbed with flat stones. The size of
    these ruins may be better understood when we state that five buildings
    measured in circumference respectively 872, 700, 1700, 1300 and 1300
    feet; while the number of rooms, still well-defined on the ground
    floor of each, is 72, 99, 112, 124 and 139. Some of these buildings
    undoubtedly had as high as a thousand rooms, while the smallest of them
    probably contained half that number. The smallest apartments are five
    feet square, while the largest are eight by fourteen feet. The ground
    plan of the buildings of this valley have three tiers of rooms, while
    one building, the Pueblo Bonito, has four tiers of apartments. The
    usual form of the buildings corresponds to three sides of a rectangle,
    with the fourth (one of the long sides of the figure) left unbuilt
    (except that in some cases it was inclosed by a semicircular stone
    wall), thus affording a partially enclosed court of large dimensions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
    The exterior walls are in all cases perpendicular, thus differing from
    the pueblos farther south. The terracing in the Chaco structures is
    upon the inside (court side) of the buildings.</p>

  <p>In some of the buildings, however, the angles of the quadrangle are
    rounded, and in one instance—that of the Peñasca Blanco—the structure
    is elliptical. From the nature of the plan of any of these buildings
    it is evident that many of the apartments on the ground floor were
    dark, and were probably used for granaries and store-rooms. There are
    no doors whatever in the outer walls, and no windows except in the
    upper stories. Windows and doors opening into the courts are, on the
    contrary, numerous in all the stories but the first. The doors are
    quite small, in many cases not exceeding two and a half feet square.
    The lintels of the doors and windows are in most cases stone slabs, but
    in some instances are small round timbers tied together with withes. A
    remarkable feature of the construction is the presence of the Yucatan
    arch formed of overlapping stones, illustrations of which may be seen
    in our next chapter. Dr. Hammond, a companion of Lieutenant Simpson,
    has minutely described a room of very perfect finish.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Each edifice
    was provided with the sacred estufa, and some of the houses had as
    many as seven, circular in form, excavated several feet deep in the
    earth and enclosed with circular walls. One in the Pueblo Bonito was
    of remarkable size, having been sixty feet in diameter, extending
    twelve feet below the surface and rising two or three stories high.
    Lieutenant Simpson found in close proximity to one of the ruins an
    excavation in the cliff which had been enclosed with a front wall of
    well-laid stone and mortar, thus associating one of the simplest of
    the cave-dwellings to which we shall refer presently, with one of the
    most extensive and perfect of the Pueblo buildings; a fact of no little
    value in identifying the architects of both as one and the same.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
    This introduces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span> us to another class of ruins, which, with a couple of
    exceptions, were not discovered prior to the summer of 1874. We refer
    to the cliff-dwellings, the most remarkable habitations ever occupied
    by man. The descriptions of them seem more suitable to form parts of
    the most romantic works of fiction than of sober and scientific memoirs
    from the pens of government explorers. One hundred miles westward from
    the ruins of the Chaco lies the Chelly Valley or Cañon. The Chelly is
    one of the tributaries of the Rio San Juan from the south, having its
    source in the Navajo country. The Chelly Cañon is described as from
    one hundred and fifty to nine hundred feet wide, with perpendicular
    sides between three hundred and five hundred feet high. Simpson in 1849
    found several caves built up in front with stone and mortar in a side
    cañon. About four miles from its foot or mouth he observed on a shelf
    fifty feet high, accessible only by ladders, a stone ruin, the plan of
    which resembles that of the Chaco Valley pueblos, except that it was
    constructed on a considerably smaller scale. Three miles further up the
    cañon a double ruin of an extraordinary nature was discovered. At the
    base of the cañon stood an ancient pueblo in ruins, but with parts of
    the first and second stories still erect. Fifty feet in a perpendicular
    line, above and immediately back of the first edifice, in a shelf, or
    in the mouth of a cavern in the cañon’s walls, stood another building
    constructed of sandstone and mortar, and measuring one hundred and
    forty-five by forty-five feet, with walls eighteen feet high still
    standing. Broken pottery was plentiful, as around all the ruins we have
    described. The building was lighted by square windows and provided with
    a circular estufa.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

  <p>The most surprising results in all the history of archæological
    exploration in this country were obtained in September, 1874, by a
    party connected with the United States Geological and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>Geographical
    Survey Corps. This party was composed of only three persons, Mr. W.
    H. Jackson and Mr. Ingersoll with their guide, Captain John Moss, a
    resident of La Plata, who possessed both a knowledge of the country and
    an acquaintance with the language of the Indians. In the south-western
    corner of Colorado, the cañons of two of the tributaries of the San
    Juan were examined, namely, the valleys of the Rivers Mancos and
    McElmo.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> The former stream rises among the western foothills of the
    Sierra La Plata, and flows south-westerly through fertile valleys to
    a great table-land known as the “Mesa Verde,” thence to the San Juan
    near the crossing of the boundary lines of the four territories. In
    the upper valley of the Mancos, between the mountains and the mesa,
    groups of undistinguishable ruins were discovered in great numbers.
    An examination of the shapeless heaps revealed foundations composed
    of great square blocks of adobe. The great multitude of these heaps
    of masonry overgrown with pines indicates a general and unsparing
    destruction of the houses of the people who once inhabited the valley,
    at the hands of their enemies. The cañon through the Mesa Verde is
    quite uniformly two hundred yards wide, with perpendicular walls of
    grayish cretaceous sandstone ranging from six hundred to one thousand
    feet in height. Numbers of the mounds of ruined adobe were met with at
    each advance into the cañon, and upon promontories jutting out towards
    the stream, remains of stone walls were seen as high as fifty feet
    from the river’s bed. Every step revealed great quantities of broken
    pottery, and with this statement we will let the subject of these
    fragmentary relics of the by-gone civilization rest for the present.</p>

  <p>One of the first cliff houses discovered by the explorers is a most
    interesting structure, the position of which, over six hundred feet
    from the bottom of the cañon in a niche of the wall, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>furnishes a
    significant commentary on the straits to which this sorely-pressed
    people were driven by their enemies. Five hundred feet of the ascent
    to this aërial dwelling was comparatively easy, but a hundred feet
    of almost perpendicular wall confronted the party, up which they
    could never have climbed but for the fact that they found a series of
    steps cut in the face of the rock leading up to the ledge upon which
    the house was built.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100">
    <img src="The%20North%20Americans%20of%20Antiquity,%20by%20John%20T.%20Short_files/i_295.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="caption smcap">Cliff-House in the Cañon of the Mancos.</div>
  </div>

  <p>This ledge was ten feet wide by twenty feet in length, with a a
    vertical space between it and the overhanging rock of fifteen feet.
    The house occupied only half this space, the remainder having been
    used as an esplanade, and once was inclosed by a balustrade resting
    on abutments, built partly upon the sloping face of the precipice
    below. The house was but twelve feet high and two-storied. Though the
    walls did not reach up to the rock above, it is uncertain whether it
    ever had any other roof. The ground plan showed a front room of six
    by nine feet in dimensions, in the rear of which were two smaller
    rooms, each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span> measuring five by seven feet. The left-hand room projected
    along the cliff, beyond the front room, in the form of an L. The rock
    of the cliff served as the rear wall of the house. The cedar beams
    upon which the upper floor had rested had nearly all disappeared.
    The door opening on the esplanade was but twenty by thirty inches in
    size, while a window in the same story was but twelve inches square.
    A window in the upper story, which commands an extended view down the
    cañon, corresponded in dimensions and position with the door below.
    The lintels of the window were small straight cedar sticks laid close
    together, upon which the stones rested. Opposite this window was
    another and smaller one, opening into a semicircular cistern, formed by
    a wall inclosing the angle formed by the side wall of the house against
    the rock, and holding about two and a half hogsheads. The bottom of the
    reservoir was reached by descending on a series of cedar pegs about
    one foot apart, and leading downward from the window. The workmanship
    of the structure was of a superior order; the perpendiculars were
    true ones and the angles carefully squared. The mortar used was of
    a grayish white color, very compact and adhesive. Some little taste
    was evinced by the occupants of this human swallow’s nest. The front
    rooms were plastered smoothly with a thin layer of firm adobe cement,
    colored a deep maroon, while a white band, eight inches wide, had been
    painted around the room at both floor and ceiling. An examination of
    the immediate vicinity revealed the ruins of half a dozen similar
    dwellings in the ledges of the cliffs, some of them occupying positions
    the inaccessibility of which must ever be a wonder, when considered as
    places of residence for human beings. Half-way down the cañon, one of
    Mr. Jackson’s party discovered a rather remarkable watch-tower, which,
    because of the accumulations of débris, he was not able to accurately
    measure, though approximate figures were given. Since his visit, the
    tower has been thoroughly examined by Mr. W. H. Holmes, to whose work
    in this field we will refer on a future page. Mr. Holmes’ measurements
    and ground-plan are, therefore, substituted for those of Mr. Jackson.</p>

  <p>The diameter of the outer wall is forty-three feet, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span> of the inner,
    twenty-five feet. The outer wall is still standing to the height of
    twelve feet at one point, and is in a fair state of preservation,
    with a thickness of twenty-one inches, and has the stones dressed to
    the curve. The ring-shaped space between the inner and outer wall is
    estimated to have contained ten compartments, two of which at present
    have complete walls. No door or window was observed in the outer wall,
    and it is supposed that access was obtained by means of a ladder. Two
    nearly rectangular openings were found connecting the outer apartments
    with the central part of the tower, which no doubt was used as an
    estufa.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> Mr. Jackson, after leaving the tower which Mr. Holmes has
    so fully described (of which the above is but a condensed account), saw
    similar towers on a somewhat <span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>smaller scale. His next discovery in the
    face of the vertical rock, which here ran up from the bottom of the
    cañon and at a height of from fifty to one hundred feet, were a number
    of nest-like habitations, one of which is figured in the cut.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Cliff-Dwelling of the Mancos Cañon.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The cliff-house in this case was reached by its occupants from the
    top of the cañon. The walls are pronounced as firm as the rock upon
    which they were built. The stones were very regular in size, and the
    chinking-in of small chips of stone rendered the surface of the wall
    remarkably smooth and well finished. The dwelling measured fifteen
    feet in length, five feet in width, and six feet in height. A short
    distance below this little dwelling, five or six cave-like crevices
    were found walled up in front with very perfect walls, rendered smooth
    by chinking. Three miles farther down the cañon, the party discovered
    at heights ranging from six hundred and eight hundred feet above their
    heads, some curious and unique little dwellings sandwiched in among
    the crevices of the horizontal strata of the rock of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span> which the bluff
    was composed. Access to the summit of the bluff, a thousand feet
    high, was obtained by a circuitous path through a side cañon, and the
    houses themselves could only be reached at the utmost peril—of being
    precipitated to the bottom of the dizzy abyss—by crawling along a
    ledge twenty inches wide and only high enough for a man in a creeping
    position. This led to the wider shelf on which the houses rested. The
    perfection of the finish was especially noticeable in one of these
    houses, which was but fifteen feet long and seven feet high, with a
    side wall running back in a semicircular sweep. In every instance the
    party found the elevated cliff-houses situated on the western side of
    the cañon with their outlook toward the east, while the buildings at
    the bottom of the cañon were indiscriminately built on both sides of
    the river.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Cliff-Dwelling of the Mancos Cañon.</div>
  </div>

  <p>A circular watch-tower, which may be said to serve as a fair type of
    others met with at irregular intervals, is shown in the cut (p. 300).
    The tower remained standing to a height of twenty feet. Its diameter
    measured twelve feet and the thickness of the walls sixteen inches,
    the stones being of uniform size and smoothly dressed to the curve of
    the circle. A rectangular structure, divided into two apartments, each
    about fifteen feet square, once joined the tower, but now is in ruins,
    all but the foundation. It is supposed that this edifice was built over
    a large subterranean keep or place of defence. The exploring party here
    emerged from the cañon, and could discern, as they glanced down the
    valley of the Rio Mancos, which now turned towards the west, mounds of
    shapeless ruins at short distances from one another as far as the eye
    could reach.</p>

  <p>Bearing around the Mesa to the west, the party encamped upon the
    site of the most extensive mass of ruins yet found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span> United States
    territory, “known as the Aztec Springs.” As Mr. Jackson’s description
    is but partial, we defer the treatment of this locality until we take
    up the explorations of Mr. Holmes, already mentioned. Four miles
    distant from “Aztec Springs,” the party reached a river-bed, dry during
    most of the year, and known as the McElmo, which, when it flows at all,
    empties into the San Juan farther to the west. On the <i>mesa</i>,
    above this river-bed, a tower resembling that first met in the Mancos
    was observed, but of much greater size, having a diameter of fifty
    feet. Adjoining the tower were the ruins of large subdivided buildings
    resembling the community dwellings of the Moquis and the old ruins of
    the Chaco. This group of ruins was very extensive and complicated,
    literally occupying all the available space in the vicinity.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Watch-Tower of the Cañon of the Mancos.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Half a dozen miles down the cañon of the McElmo, several of the little
    nest-like dwellings peculiar to the Mancos were seen perched forty or
    fifty feet above the valley. A couple of miles beyond these, the tower
    shown in the cut (p. 301) was discovered standing on the summit of a
    great block of sandstone forty feet high, and detached from the bluff
    back of it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Square Tower on the McElmo.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The building which surmounts this rocky pedestal is square and about
    fifteen feet high at present. Windows open toward the north and east,
    the directions from which the enemies of this people, according to
    tradition, came down upon them. A wall at the base of the rock is
    mostly in ruins and covered with débris from the building above.
    Immediately beyond this point the boundary line into Utah was crossed,
    and two or three miles distant the party came upon a very interesting
    group, a historic spot in the career of this ancient race. In the
    centre of the widening valley stands a solitary butte of dark-red
    sandstone, upon a perfectly smooth floor of the same, dipping gently
    towards the centre of the valley. This butte or <i>cristone</i> is
    about one hundred feet high and three hundred feet in length, of
    irregular form. All around the rock are remains of stone walls which
    indicate an extensive structure and complicated system of walls and
    towers. At the back of the rock two remains attract special attention.
    One wall forming the corner of a building near the base of the rock,
    seems to have served as an approach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span> to the larger house up in the
    side of the butte. This structure is about eighteen feet in length and
    twelve feet in height, nearly reaching to the top of the rock. Part
    of the walls have fallen, but those standing show a finish surpassing
    those of any structure previously discovered in the region. In front is
    a single aperture eighteen by twenty-four inches. On top of the rock
    are remains of masonry, but too badly ruined to indicate their original
    form. All the crevices and irregularities in the faces of the butte had
    been smoothly walled up; it is supposed, to make its ascent impossible.
    In the vicinity a tower with a rounded corner and twelve feet in
    diameter by twenty feet high stood in a dry creek bed.</p>

  </div>

  <p>We remarked that this was a historic locality, as certainly it was if
    the legend obtained by Captain Moss from an old man among the Moquis is
    reliable. Mr. Ingersoll has rendered it in the <cite>New York Tribune</cite>
    for November 3d, 1874, as follows: “Formerly, the aborigines inhabited
    all this country we had been over as far west as the head-waters of
    the San Juan, as far north as the Rio Dolores, west some distance into
    Utah, and south and south-west throughout Arizona and on down into
    Mexico. They had lived there from time immemorial—since the earth was
    a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> small island, which augmented as its inhabitants multiplied. They
    cultivated the valley, fashioned whatever utensils and tools they
    needed very neatly and handsomely out of clay and wood and stone, not
    knowing any of the useful metals; built their homes and kept their
    flocks and herds in the fertile river-bottoms, and worshipped the
    sun. They were an eminently peaceful and prosperous people, living
    by agriculture rather than by the chase. About a thousand years ago,
    however, they were visited by savage strangers from the North, whom
    they treated hospitably. Soon these visits became more frequent and
    annoying. Then their troublesome neighbors—ancestors of the present
    Utes—began to forage upon them, and, at last, to massacre them and
    devastate their farms; so, to save their lives at least, they built
    houses high upon the cliffs where they could store food and hide away
    till the raiders left. But one summer the invaders did not go back to
    their mountains as the people expected, but brought their families with
    them and settled down. So, driven from their homes and lands, starving
    in their little niches on the high cliffs, they could only steal away
    during the night, and wander across the cheerless uplands. To one who
    has traveled these steppes, such a flight seems terrible, and the
    mind hesitates to picture the suffering of the sad fugitives. At the
    <i>Cristone</i> they halted and probably found friends, for the rocks
    and caves are full of the nests of these human wrens and swallows. Here
    they collected, erected stone fortifications and watch-towers, dug
    reservoirs in the rocks to hold a supply of water, which in all cases
    is precarious in this latitude, and once more stood at bay. Their foes
    came, and for one long month fought and were beaten back, and returned
    day after day to the attack as merciless and inevitable as the tide.
    Meanwhile, the families of the defenders were evacuating and moving
    south, and bravely did their protectors shield them till they were all
    safely a hundred miles away. The besiegers were beaten back and went
    away. But the narrative tells us that the hollows of the rocks were
    filled to the brim with the mingled blood of conquerors and conquered,
    and red veins of it ran down into the cañon. It was such a victory as
    they could not afford to gain again, and they were glad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span> when the long
    fight was over, to follow their wives and little ones to the south.
    There, in the deserts of Arizona, on well-nigh unapproachable isolated
    bluffs, they built new towns, and their few descendants, the Moquis,
    live in them to this day, preserving more carefully and purely the
    history and veneration of their forefathers than their skill or wisdom.
    It was from one of their old men that this traditional sketch was
    obtained.” In a side cañon, a tower eighteen feet high was seen perched
    on a huge block of sandstone which had fallen from the top of the
    <i>mesa</i> and lodged on a projecting shelf of rock, midway from top
    or bottom. Eight or ten miles westward of the McElmo, Mr. Jackson and
    his party discovered on a stream known as the Hovenweep, the ruins of
    a city. Mr. Jackson’s description is as follows: “The stream referred
    to sweeps the foot of a rocky sandstone ledge, some forty or fifty feet
    in height, upon which is built the highest and better-preserved portion
    of the settlement. Its semicircular sweep conforms to the ledge, each
    little house of the outer circle being built close upon its edge. Below
    the level of these upper houses some ten or twelve feet, and within
    the semicircular sweep, are seven distinctly marked depressions, each
    separated from the other by rocky débris, the lower or first series
    probably of small community houses. Upon either flank, and founded
    upon rocks, are buildings similar in size and in other respects to
    the large ones on the line above. As paced off,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span> the upper or convex
    surface measured one hundred yards in length. Each little apartment
    is small and narrow, averaging six feet in width and eight feet in
    length, the walls being eighteen inches in thickness. The stones of
    which the entire group is built are dressed to nearly uniform size and
    laid in mortar. A peculiar feature here is in the round corners, one at
    least appearing upon nearly every little house. They are turned with
    considerable care and skill, being true curves solidly bound together.”</p>

  <p>Here the labors of Mr. Jackson’s party ended for the year 1874, but
    the work was again resumed in July of the following year with even
    richer results. Two parties were put in the field by the Government
    Surveying Corps, one headed by Mr. Jackson and the other by Mr. W. H.
    Holmes, geologists of the San Juan division of the survey for 1875.
    I am indebted to Prof. Hayden, United States geologist-in-charge,
    for the memoirs prepared by these gentlemen, with the accompanying
    illustrations.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The reader has already become acquainted with the
    general character of the remains of the cliff-dwellers, and it will
    not be necessary to repeat the descriptions of buildings or ruins
    similar to those already described in these pages. We shall therefore
    cite only the more remarkable ruins discovered by the above-named
    explorers. Mr. Jackson was accompanied on his second tour, by Mr. E.
    A. Barber, naturalist and correspondent of the <cite>New York Herald</cite>,
    with Harry Lee as guide and interpreter. The party resumed their labors
    in the arid, waterless region around the Hovenweep, and in fact the
    same barren characteristics are peculiar to the whole basin of the
    San Juan. The whole region is rapidly drying up and fast becoming a
    desert. Down the cañon from the pueblo of the Hovenweep, broken towers
    and rock shelters were passed in rapid succession. Seven miles distant
    from their starting-point, they found on the western side of the valley
    three elevated benches ranging one above another in the face of a
    jutting promontory, each of which contained <span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>houses (see illustration,
    <a href="#i_307">page 307</a>). The first bench was reached by climbing over a sloping
    mass of débris to a height of one hundred feet from the base of the
    cliff, while the upper benches were only accessible by means of a niche

    <div class="caption smcap">Cliff-House of the Hovenweep.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Ruins and masses of charcoal were found at the base of the rock.
    Numerous adobe foundations, probably of wooden buildings, always
    circular in form and ranging from fifteen to twenty-five feet in
    diameter, were met with a short distance down the cañon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span> Near the
    junction of the Hovenweep and McElmo cañons an inscription covers sixty
    feet of the face of a large rock. The figures are those of men, goats,
    lizards, and hieroglyphic signs. As the party proceeded in the cañon
    they met rock shelters and enclosures, the latter on the top of the
    mesa in which slabs of stone three by five feet in size were set on
    end. Mr. Jackson reports that a party connected with the survey corps
    discovered near the head of the Hovenweep, on a ledge three hundred
    feet long by fifty feet wide, one-third of the distance from the top
    of the cañon, some forty houses crowded along the shelf all in a row.
    On the San Juan west of the mouth of the Montezuma Cañon, upon a bench
    fifty feet high, Mr. Jackson found a quadrangular structure of peculiar
    design, as shown in the cut on <a href="#i_308">page 308</a>.</p>

  <p>“We see that it is arranged very nearly at right angles to the river,
    its greatest depth on the left, where it runs back one hundred and
    twenty feet; the front sweeps back in a diagonal line, so that the
    right-hand side is only thirty-two feet in depth. The back wall is
    one hundred and fifty-eight feet long, and at right angles to the two
    sides. In the centre of the building, looking out upon the river, is
    an open space seventy-five feet wide, and averaging forty feet in
    depth, its depressed centre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span> divided nearly equally by a ridge running
    through it at right angles to the river. We judged it to have been an
    open court, because there was not the least vestige of a wall in front,
    or on the ridge through the centre, while upon the other three sides
    they were perfectly distinct; although it is difficult to explain why
    it should have been hollowed out in the manner shown in the plan. Back
    of this court is a series of seven apartments of equal size, springing
    in a perfect arch from the heavy wall facing the court, leaving a
    semicircular space in the centre, forty-five feet across its greatest
    diameter. Each one is fifteen feet in length, and the same in width
    across its centre, the walls somewhat irregular in thickness, but
    averaging twenty inches, compact, and well laid. On the left are three
    rooms extending across the whole width of the building, each averaging
    forty-five by forty feet square; on the right only one was discernible.
    Back of the circle, our impression was that the walls diverged in the
    manner shown in the plan, although there is so much confusion resulting
    from the heaping up of the débris that much must be left to conjecture.
    There is also a slight shadow of doubt in regard to the wall facing the
    river on the right; it is barely possible that it extended somewhat
    farther out, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span> there is here a steep inclination to the
    brink of the bluff, and that it has become entirely obliterated by
    its foundations giving way. The remains of the wall above, however,
    led us to believe that it had been originally built in the way it is
    shown in the plan. Extreme massiveness is indicated throughout the
    whole structure by the amount of débris about the line of the walls,
    forming long rounded mounds four to five feet high, with the stone-work
    cropping out, twenty to twenty-four inches in thickness.”</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Rock-Shelters of the San Juan Cañon.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In the face of the bluff immediately under this ruin and upon
    a recessed bench three hundred feet long was a row of little
    rock-shelters, with just enough room on the ledge in front of them
    to admit of a promenade the entire length of the shelf. All down the
    valley of the San Juan, rock shelters and dwellings similar to the
    group shown in the cut, were met with.</p>

  <p>In this instance the houses were situated sixty feet above the trail
    without any visible means of access. If ladders were used, they were
    made of timber taller than any of the trees now growing in the valley.
    Twelve miles below the Montezuma the party discovered really one of
    the most picturesque and wonderful of all the cliff-dwellings. On the
    opposite side of the river, where the bluff was two hundred feet high,
    near the top of the cliff, they observed a deeply receding cave with
    an opening nearly circular “two hundred feet in diameter, divided
    equally between the two kinds of rocks, reaching, within a few feet,
    the top of the bluff above and the level of the valley below. It runs
    back in a semicircular sweep to a depth of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span> hundred feet; the
    top is a perfect half dome, and the lower half only less so from the
    accumulation of débris and the thick brushy foliage, the cool dampness
    of its shadowed interior, where the sun never touches, favoring a
    luxuriant growth. A stratum of harder rock across the central line of
    the cave has left a bench running around its entire half circle, upon
    which is built the row of buildings which caught our attention half a
    mile away.”</p>

  </div>

  <p>“It will be seen that the houses occupy the left-hand or eastern half
    of the cave, for the reason, probably, that the ledge was wider on
    that side, and the wall back of it receded in such a manner as to give
    considerable additional room for the second floor, or for the upper
    part of the one-story rooms. It is about fifty feet from the outer edge
    in to the first building, a small structure sixteen feet long, three
    feet wide at the outer end, and four at the opposite end; the walls,
    standing only four feet on the highest remaining corner, were nearly
    all tumbled in. Then came an open space eleven feet wide and nine deep,
    that served probably as a sort of workshop. Four holes were drilled
    into the smooth rock floor, about six feet equidistantly apart, each
    from six to ten inches deep and five in diameter, as perfectly round
    as though drilled by machinery. We can reasonably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
    assume that these
    people were familiar with the art of weaving, and that it was here
    they worked at the loom, the drilled holes supporting its posts. At
    <i>b</i>, in this open space, are a number of grooves worn into the
    rock in various places, caused by the artificers of the little town
    in shaping and polishing their stone implements. The main building
    comes next, occupying the widest portion of the ledge, which gives an
    average width of ten feet inside; it is forty-eight feet long outside,
    and twelve high, divided inside into three rooms, the first two
    thirteen and a half feet each in length, and the third sixteen feet,
    divided into two stories, the lower and upper five feet in height. The
    joist holes did not penetrate through the walls, being inserted about
    six inches, half the thickness. The beams rested upon the sloping
    back-wall, which receded far enough to make the upper rooms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span> about
    square. Window-like apertures afforded communication between each room,
    all through the second story, excepting that which opened out to the
    back of the cave. There was also one window in each lower room, about
    twelve inches square, looking out toward the open country, and in the
    upper rooms several small apertures not more than three inches wide
    were pierced through the wall, hardly more than peep-holes. The walls
    of the large building continued back in an unbroken line one hundred
    and thirty feet farther, with an average height of eight feet, and
    divided into eleven apartments, with communicating apertures through
    all. The first room was nine and a half feet wide, the others dwindling
    down gradually to only four feet in width at the other extremity.
    The rooms were of unequal length, the following being their inside
    measurements, commencing from the outer end, viz.: 12½, 9½, 8, 7½,
    9, 10, 8, 7, 7, 8, 31 feet; the ledge then runs along, gradually
    narrowing, fifty feet farther, where another wall occurs across it,
    after which it soon merges into the smooth wall of the cave. The first
    of these rooms had an aperture leading outward large enough to crawl
    through; the wall around it had been broken away so that its exact size
    could not be determined; all the others, of which there were about two
    to each room, were mere peep-holes, about three inches in diameter, and
    generally pierced through the wall at a downward angle.” The apartments
    were well plastered, and in one or two places even the delicate lines
    on the thumbs and fingers of the plasterers had been plainly retained.
    At one point an entire hand had left its impress in the cement.</p>

  </div>

  <p>All these marks indicated that the hands of these people were much
    smaller than those of the explorers, and it is supposed that they were
    those of women and children. A circular hollow place, all begrimed
    and blackened by smoke, seemed to indicate the locality of a common
    kitchen. The surroundings of this little community of that ancient
    people indicated that they were well-to-do, and were probably the lords
    of the neighboring country. From their home in this elevated gallery,
    under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span> nature’s arching roof of rock, they were in a position to give
    defiance to their enemies and enjoy the pursuit of their pastoral
    occupations. This unique residence was named by the explorers the
    Casa del Eco. Over the plateau westward, the remains of this ancient
    people were numerous and of the same general character as already
    described. The party after reaching the Cañon of the Chelly (the stream
    flowing, as already stated, into the San Juan from the south) found
    several circular caves averaging about one hundred feet in diameter and
    containing the ruins of old houses.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Cave-Village in the Valley of the Rio Chelly.</div>
  </div>

  <p>About five miles southward from the San Juan, and in a valley of the
    Chelly, a cave-village of considerable extent was discovered, perched
    upon a recessed bench about seventy feet above the valley, and overhung
    by a solid wall of massive sandstone, extending up over two hundred
    feet farther. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span> Jackson describes it in detail as follows: “The
    left-hand side of the bench supporting the buildings sweeps back in a
    sharp curve about eighty feet under the bluff, and then gradually comes
    to the front again until, on the extreme right hand, the buildings are
    built upon a mass of débris, but partially protected overhead. The
    total length over the solidly built portion of the town is five hundred
    and forty-five feet, with a greater width in no place of more than
    forty feet. There are somewhere in the neighborhood of seventy-five
    rooms upon the ground-plan, with some uncertainty existing as to many
    of the subdivisions on the right; but in the cave-built portion every
    apartment was distinctly marked. Midway in the town is a circular
    room of heavily and solidly built masonry, that was probably meant
    for an estufa or council-hall; that is, if we can reasonably assume
    any similarity in the methods of building or worship to those of the
    pueblos of New Mexico. Starting from this estufa is a narrow passage
    running back of the line of houses on the left to a two-story group,
    where it ends abruptly, further access being had through the back
    row of rooms, or over the roofs of the lower front row, probably the
    latter, for it is likely that these roofs served as a platform from
    which to enter the rooms back of it. At the extreme end a still higher
    ledge occurs, with the overhanging wall coming down close over it, its
    outer edge enclosed by a wall, and a little store-room in its farther
    corner; it was reserved, probably, as an out-door working-room. All
    the buildings of this half are of one story, with the exception of one
    group, the residence probably of the chief or of some other important
    family in the community. The rooms just back of it are the store-rooms
    of the family, where the corn and squashes were put away for the
    winter’s consumption. Near these store-rooms, there are two half-round
    enclosures of stone-work, that are very likely the remains of small
    reservoirs or springs. The rock back of them is dug out beneath, and
    had, even in the dry season, when we were there, a damp appearance, as
    though water was not far removed, and might easily be coaxed to the
    surface. The front line of wall of this left side of the town is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span> built
    upon a steep angle of smooth rock, with the interior of the apartments
    filled up with earth so as to make their floors level, bringing them a
    little below the passage-way. In two or three instances the front wall
    has given way, precipitating all but the back wall to the bottom of the
    cliffs. Holes have been drilled into the rock in a few places beneath
    the walls, evidently to assist in retaining them in their places.
    The whole front of this portion of the town is without an aperture,
    save very small windows, and is perfectly inaccessible, both from the
    solidity of the wall and the precipitous nature of the foundation-rock
    beneath it. Admittance was probably gained from near the circular
    building in the centre, by ladders or any other well-guarded approach
    over the rocks.”</p>

  <p>Two miles down the Cañon of the Chelly, below the mouth of the fertile
    Cañon Bonito Chiquito, the house figured on <a href="#Page_306">page 306</a> was found with its
    niched stairway cut in the face of the rock. The house is two-storied,
    twenty feet in height, the lower story of which is eighteen by ten feet
    square, divided into two rooms. A natural reservoir of water was found
    in the rock only twenty rods distant. Eight miles up the Chelly they
    came to the cave Pueblo, seen by Simpson and mentioned on <a href="#Page_293">page 293</a>.
    From this point it was but forty miles to the inhabited Moquis town
    Tegua. The explorers after visiting that interesting place returned
    northward again to the San Juan, reaching Epsom Creek, a tributary of
    the same from the north, a short distance from the mouth of the Chelly
    Cañon. Among a number of remains found in the Cañon of Epsom Creek,
    one in particular is of interest; this was the remnant of a square
    tower, of most perfect masonry, built upon a point of rock entirely
    inaccessible to the explorers.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Elevated Tower on Epsom Creek.</div>
  </div>

  <p>A few miles farther up the Epsom Valley, the ruins of quite a town
    were discovered. “It lay upon both sides of a small, dry ravine, some
    twenty or thirty rods back from the bed of the creek, and consisted
    of a main rectangular mass sixty by one hundred feet, occupying quite
    an elevation, dominating all the others. Just below it and close
    upon the edge of the ravine, was a round tower, twenty-five feet in
    diameter; and seventy-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span> below that, and also close to the ravine,
    was a square building, twenty-feet across, nearly obscured by a
    thicket of piñon-trees, growing about it. On the opposite bank were
    two small round towers, each fifteen feet in diameter, with two oblong
    structures between, twelve by fifteen feet square; at right angles to
    these four, which were arranged in a straight line, another square
    building occurred, the same size as the one just opposite on the other
    bank.” The surroundings of this ancient village are described as truly
    picturesque and the valley fertile, contrasting considerably with
    the Chelly Cañon. The exploring party followed the Epsom to a point
    thirty miles above the San Juan, and in the head cañons between it and
    the Montezuma found themselves in the midst of ruins which mark the
    former presence of a dense population. No ruins were found near the
    Sierra Abajo nor in the great basin lying between it and the Sierra
    La Sal. In the deep cañon of the Montezuma (fifteen hundred feet
    deep), cliff-dwellings and other remains were found in great numbers.
    Cave-shelters, with the orifice of the oval and circular crevices
    in the rocks walled up with neat masonry and accessible by means of
    niche-steps for the hands and feet, leading up the perpendicular cliff
    to the little nest-like houses above, were especially numerous. In one
    of these a skeleton was found, but examination proved it to be that of
    a Navajo, and quite certainly not that of one of the ancient residents.
    At different points midway down the cañon, narrow promontories jut out
    into the valley a hundred yards or more, ranging from twenty to one
    hundred feet in height. Within a distance of sixteen miles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span> eighteen
    of these were observed, covered with ruins of massive stone-built
    structures. They were rectangular in form, ranging from one hundred
    by two hundred feet, down to thirty by forty feet in size. We cannot
    devote further attention to the vast number of ruins found by Mr.
    Jackson and party in the Montezuma Valley, except to note the curious
    little house shown in the cut.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Cave-Dwelling in the Montezuma Valley.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Among a colony of these cave-dwellings, occurring at the first bend
    of the West Montezuma, a dozen miles above its junction with the
    east fork, this one commands attention as much for the neatness and
    perfection of its masonry as for the snug little cave in which its
    architect lodged it. A block of sandstone resting on the edge of the
    mesa bench fifty feet above the valley, had a deep oval hole worn in it
    by the winds and sands. This was occupied by the little house, ten feet
    long, six feet high and five feet deep; a space, however, was reserved
    at one end to serve as a platform from which to enter.</p>

  <p>In addition to the explorations of Mr. Jackson and party, Mr. W. H.
    Holmes of the Geological and Geographical Survey, was also assigned
    the duty of examining ancient remains in the valley of the Upper San
    Juan, during the summer of 1875.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>Mr. Holmes and party examined
    an area of nearly six thousand square miles, chiefly in Colorado on
    the San Juan and its tributaries. Most of the ruins met with were of
    the same general character and description as those examined by Mr.
    Jackson, and to repeat in detail the majority of descriptions contained
    in Mr. Holmes’ memoir, would be to weary the reader with repetitions
    without affording additional advantage. However, a few remarkable ruins
    described by Mr. Holmes command our attention. The first of these which
    may be pronounced unique in this section of the country, and quite
    unlike anything met with thus far in the exploration, is situated on
    the Rio La Plata, about twenty-five miles above its junction with
    the San Juan. The remains of an extensive village with structures of
    various forms, are scattered upon a terrace some twenty feet above
    the river-bed. The distribution of the works viewed in connection
    with plans upon which they were constructed are suggestive of the
    remains of the mound-builders of the Ohio valley. The forms are chiefly
    rectangular and circular, one or two seem to have been elliptical while
    a number have consisted of irregular groups of apartments. All now
    lie in ruins with their outlines marked by ridges of débris composed
    of earth, water-worn pebbles, and small fragments of sandstone. The
    walls of the main structure are still prominently defined, while those
    of a circular enclosure, used probably as an estufa, are standing to
    the height of four feet. Three hundred feet directly north of this
    enclosure is a truncated rectangular mound nine feet high, measuring
    fifty by eighty feet. In one of the angles of the east end are the
    remains of what may have been a tower rising above the platform of the
    mound. One hundred feet north of this mound is a rectangular enclosure
    measuring sixty by one hundred feet. Its wall ranges from four to six
    feet in height. The ruins of a wall extending between the mound and the
    enclosure, indicate that they were once connected. A system of works
    joined these to a range of low hills, lying to the north. Southward
    from the large central circle are earthworks and ruins covering an
    area of fifteen thousand square feet. A large number of small circles
    and mounds occupy the southern extremity of the terrace. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span> is
    impossible to account for the sudden change in the plan of works so
    contiguous to those of a well-marked pueblo origin. On the San Juan
    River, thirty-five miles below the mouth of the La Plata and ten miles
    above the Mancos, Mr. Holmes observed an interesting combination of
    cave-shelters and towers united in a system for giving signals upon the
    approach of the enemy. In the face of a vertical bluff thirty-five feet
    high and about half way from the trail below, caves had been quarried
    or weathered in considerable numbers in the shales which constitute one
    of the strata in the bluff. A hard platform of rock formed the floor,
    and afforded sufficient protection for a narrow platform in front of
    these openings. Immediately above these caves upon the summit of the
    bluffs, a system of ruined circular towers, enclosed by semicircular
    walls with the open side of the semicircle facing the precipice, was
    observed. The caves were accessible from the valley below only by means
    of ladders, and the towers in turn only by ladders from the caves
    through the open side of their semicircular enclosures. The walls of
    these enclosures presented no openings to the plateau above, and it is
    inferred that the towers which they enclosed served as outlooks from
    which the sentinel could signal the people who were engaged in tilling
    the valley below to flee to their cave-shelters at the approach of the
    enemy, and when too closely pressed by an enemy upon the plateau the
    sentinel himself could make his retreat by means of his ladder to the
    caves beneath.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable cliff-dwellings, discovered by Mr. Holmes, are

    <div class="caption smcap">Cave-Fortresses of the Rio Mancos.</div>
  </div>

  <p>These extraordinary fortresses, lodged in caves eight hundred feet
    above the level of the valley, are situated in the cañon of the Mancos,
    a few miles from its mouth. The first five hundred feet of the ascent
    from the level of the stream, is over a rough cliff-broken slope, the
    remainder of massive sandstone, full of niches and caves. The upper
    house is situated in a deep cavern with overhanging roof about one
    hundred feet from the cliff’s top. The front wall of the house is
    built upon the very edge of the giddy precipice. The larger house is
    lodged in a niche or cave thirty feet below. The lower house was easily
    accessible. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span> wall was built flush with the precipice and remained
    standing to a height of fourteen feet at the highest point, though
    other portions had crumbled away considerably. The house occupied the
    entire floor of the niche, which measures sixty feet long by fifteen
    feet wide. Mr. Holmes described these structures as follows; of the
    first he says:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span></p>

  <p>“The arrangement of the apartments is quite complicated and curious,
    and will be more readily understood by a reference to the ground-plan
    (figure 1). The precipice line or front edge of the niche-floor,
    extends from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>. From this the broken cliffs and
    slopes reach down to the trail and river, as shown in the accompanying
    profile (figure 3). The line <i>b c d</i> represents the deepest part
    of the recess, against which the walls are built. To the right of
    <i>b</i>, the shelf ceases, and the vertical face of rock is unbroken.
    At the left, beyond <i>a</i>, the edge is not so abrupt, and the cliffs
    below are so broken that one can ascend with ease. Above, the roof
    comes forward and curves upward, as seen in the profile.</p>

  <p>“The most striking feature of this structure is the <em>round-room</em>,
    which occurs about the middle of the ruin and inside of a large
    rectangular apartment. * * * Its walls are not high and not entirely
    regular, and the inside is curiously fashioned with offsets and
    box-like projections. It is plastered smoothly, and bears considerable
    evidence of having been used, although I observed no traces of fire.
    The entrance to this chamber is rather extraordinary, and further
    attests the peculiar importance attached to it by the builders, and
    their evident desire to secure it from all possibility of intrusion. A
    walled and covered passage-way, <i>f</i>, <i>f</i>, of solid masonry,
    ten feet of which is still intact, leads from an outer chamber through
    the small intervening apartments into the circular one. It is possible
    that this originally extended to the outer wall, and was entered from
    the outside. If so, the person desiring to visit the estufa would have
    to enter an aperture about twenty-two inches high by thirty wide,
    and crawl, in the most abject manner possible, through a tube-like
    passage-way nearly twenty-feet in length. My first impression was that
    this peculiarly-constructed doorway was a precaution against enemies,
    and that it was probably the only means of entrance to the interior
    of the house; but I am now inclined to think this hardly probable,
    and conclude that it was rather designed to render a sacred chamber
    as free as possible from profane intrusion. The apartments <i>l</i>,
    <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, do not require any especial description,
    as they are quite plain and almost empty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span> The partition walls have
    never been built up to the ceiling of the niche, and the inmates, in
    passing from one apartment to another, have climbed over. The row of
    apertures indicated in the main front wall are about five feet from
    the floor, and were doubtless entered for the insertion of beams,
    although there is no evidence that a second floor has at any time
    existed. In that part of the ruin about the covered passage-way, the
    walls are complicated, and the plan can hardly be made out, while the
    curved wall enclosing the apartment <i>e</i> is totally overthrown.
    * * * * The rock-face between this ruin and the one above is smooth
    and vertical, but by passing along the ledge a few yards to the left
    a sloping face was found, up which a stairway of small niches had
    been cut; by means of these, an active person, unincumbered, could
    ascend with safety. On reaching the top, one finds himself in the very
    doorway of the upper house (<i>a</i>, figure 2) without standing-room
    outside of the wall, and one can imagine that an enemy would stand but
    little chance of reaching and entering such a fortress if defended,
    even by women and children alone. The position of this ruin is one of
    unparalleled security, both from enemies and from the elements. The
    almost vertical cliff descends abruptly from the front wall, and the
    immense arched roof of solid stone projects forward fifteen or twenty
    feet beyond the house (see section, figure 3). At the right the ledge
    ceases, and at the left stops short against a massive vertical wall.
    The niche-stairway affords the only possible means of approach.</p>

  <p>“The house occupies the entire floor of the niche, which is about one
    hundred and twenty feet long by ten in depth at the deepest part. The
    front wall to the right and left of the doorway is quite low, portions
    having doubtless fallen off. The higher wall <i>f g</i> is about thirty
    feet long, and from ten to twelve feet high, while a very low rude wall
    extends along the more inaccessible part of the ledge, and terminates
    at the extreme right in a small enclosure, as seen in the plan at
    <i>c</i>.</p>

  <p>“In the first apartment entered, there were evidences of fire, the
    walls and ceiling being blackened with smoke. In the second, a member
    of the party, by digging in the rubbish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span> obtained a quantity of beans,
    and in the third a number of grains of corn; hence the names given.
    There are two small windows in the front wall, and doorways communicate
    between rooms separated by high partitions.</p>

  <p>“The walls of these houses are built in the usual manner, and average
    about a foot in thickness.</p>

  <p>“The upper house seems to be in a rather unfinished state, looking as
    if stone and mortar had run short. And when one considers that these
    materials must have been brought from far below by means of ropes, or
    carried in small quantities up the dangerous stairway, the only wonder
    is that it was ever brought to its present degree of finish.”</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Triple-Walled Tower on the McElmo.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The ruins of a triple-walled tower with fourteen sectional apartments
    between the outer and second walls were examined near the McElmo. One
    of these sectional apartments was still standing to the height of
    twelve feet.</p>

  <p>We have already referred to the group of ruins at Aztec Springs near
    the divide between the McElmo and the lower Mancos tributaries. “These
    ruins,” says Mr. Holmes, “form the most imposing pile of masonry yet
    found in Colorado. The whole group covers an area of about four hundred
    and eighty thousand square feet, and has an average depth of from
    three to four feet.” The accompanying plan, with the measurements and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>dimensions indicated upon it, precludes the necessity of a detailed
    description.</p>

  <p>The walls are twenty-six inches thick, and in some cases are built
    double. The whole resembles in plan one of the ruined pueblos of the
    Chaco, with the addition that it was designed to be an impregnable
    fortress.</p>

  <p>The plate from Mr. Jackson’s memoir shows specimens of pottery
    collected during his explorations among the cliff-dwellings. The pieces
    <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are of modern make, and were obtained among the
    Moquis of Tegua. The ware and finish of both these vessels are far
    inferior as compared with the ancient fragments.</p>

  <p>We have quoted on a previous page Mr. Ingersoll’s rendering of the
    romantic legend which tells in few words the sad history of the ancient
    architects of these aërial abodes. We have observed that, according to
    this account, the remnant of this people who escaped the destruction
    visited upon the cliff-dwellers by the warlike Utes fled to the
    South—to the deserts of Arizona—and built the present Moqui towns. We
    have already stated that Mr. Jackson’s party found it necessary to
    travel forty miles due southward from the ruins of the Chaco Cañon in
    order to reach Tegua, the nearest of the Moqui settlements.</p>

  <p>It may be a matter of some interest to the reader, after having studied
    the cliff architecture, to be introduced into one of the habitations
    now occupied by the descendants of that remarkable people. Lieutenant
    Ives, who visited the Moqui towns in 1858, has furnished an interesting
    account of their general characteristics, from which we take condensed
    extracts: “As the sun went down,” says Lieutenant Ives, “and the
    confused glare and mirage disappeared, I discovered with the spy-glass
    two of the Moqui towns eight or ten miles distant, upon the edge of a
    high bluff overhanging the opposite side of the valley. They were built
    close to the edge of the precipice. The outlines of the closely-packed
    structures looked in the distance like the towers and battlements of a
    castle, and their commanding position enhanced the picturesque effect.”
    “The face of the bluff, on the summit of which the town was perched,
    was cut up and irregular. We were led through a passage that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span> wound
    among some low hillocks of sand and rock that extended half-way to the
    top. It did not seem possible, while ascending through the sand-hills,
    that a spring could be found in such a dry-looking place; but presently
    a crowd was seen collecting upon a mound before a small plateau, in
    the centre of which was a circular reservoir fifty feet in diameter,
    lined with masonry and filled with pure cold water. The basin was fed
    by a pipe connecting with some source of supply upon the summit of the
    mesa. Continuing to ascend, we came to another reservoir, smaller, but
    of more elaborate construction and finish. From this the guide said
    they got their drinking water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span> the other reservoir being intended for
    animals. Between the two the face of the bluff had been ingeniously
    converted into terraces. These were faced with neat masonry, and
    contained gardens, each surrounded with a raised edge so as to retain
    water upon the surface. Pipes from the reservoir permitted them at any
    time to be irrigated. Peach trees were growing upon the terraces and in
    the hollow below. A long flight of stone steps with sharp turns that
    could be easily defended was built into the face of the precipice,
    and led from the upper reservoir to the foot of the town. The scene,
    rendered animated by the throngs of Indians in their gayly-colored
    dresses, was one of the most remarkable I had ever witnessed.” “Without
    giving us time to admire the scene, the Indians led us to a ladder
    planted against the centre of the front face of the pueblo. The town is
    nearly square and surrounded by a stone wall fifteen feet high, the top
    of which forms a landing extending around the whole. Flights of stone
    steps led from the first to a second landing, upon which the doors of
    the houses open. Mounting the stairway opposite to the ladder, the
    chief crossed to the nearest door and ushered us into a low apartment,
    from which two or three others opened towards the interior of the
    dwelling.” “The room was fifteen feet by ten; the walls were made of
    adobes; the partitions of substantial beams, the floor laid with clay.
    In one corner were a fireplace and a chimney. Everything was clean and tidy.
    <span class="figright2 illowp35">

    </span>
    Skins, bows and arrows, quivers, antlers, blankets, articles of
    clothing and ornament, were hanging from the walls or arranged upon
    shelves. Vases, flat dishes, and gourds filled with meal or water,
    were standing along on one side of the room. At the other end was a
    trough divided into compartments, in each of which was a sloping stone
    slab two or three feet square, for grinding corn upon. In a recess of
    an inner room was piled a goodly store of corn in the ear. I noticed,
    among other things, a reed musical instrument with a bell-shaped end
    like a clarionet and a pair of painted drum-sticks tipped with gaudy feathers.”</p>

  <p>“We learned that there were seven towns; that the name of that which
    we were visiting was Mooshahneh. A second smaller town was half a mile
    distant; two miles distant was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span> third. * * * Five or six miles to the
    north-east a bluff was pointed out as the location of three others; and
    we were informed that the last of the seven, Oraybe, was still further
    distant on the trail towards the great river.”</p>

  </div>

  <p>“Each pueblo is built around a rectangular court, in which we suppose
    are the springs that furnish the supply to the reservoirs. The exterior
    walls, which are of stone, have no openings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span> and would have to be
    scaled or battered down before access could be gained to the interior.
    The successive stories are set back one behind the other. The lower
    ones are reached through trap-doors from the first landing. The houses
    are three rooms deep, and open upon the interior court. The arrangement
    is as strong and compact as well could be devised, but as the court is
    common and the landings are separated by no partitions, it involves a
    certain community of residence.”</p>

  <p>In describing the gardens of Oraybe, distant eight or nine miles, he remarks:</p>

  <p>“At the foot [of the bluff] was a reservoir and a broad road winding
    up the steep ascent. On either side the bluffs were cut into terraces,
    and laid out into gardens similar to those seen at Mooshahneh, and
    like them irrigated from an upper reservoir. The whole reflected great
    credit upon Moqui ingenuity and skill in the department of engineering.
    The walls of the terraces and reservoirs were of partly-dressed
    stone, well and strongly built, and the irrigating pipes conveniently
    arranged. The little gardens were neatly laid out. * * * The walls of
    the terraces and the gardens themselves are kept in good order and
    preservation. The stone and earth for construction and repairs they
    carry in blankets upon their shoulders from the valley below.”<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

  <p>Mr. Bancroft has furnished the reader descriptions of several of the
    New Mexican group of pueblos, which he has extracted from the reports
    of various travelers. We do not consider it necessary to repeat
    accounts so generally accessible.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> The New Mexican group, situated
    on the Rio Grande del Norte and its tributaries, is the most numerous
    in inhabited pueblos, but as they differ little if at all from those
    of the Moquis, further treatment of them is unnecessary. The pueblos
    which are and have been inhabited during the nineteenth century number
    about twenty, some of which are well known to have been occupied by
    the ancestors of their present inhabitants when first visited by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>the
    Spaniards. The best specimen of inhabited pueblos is that of Taos,
    situated on one of the northern forks of the river which gives it its
    name. There are two large houses, each between three and four hundred
    feet long by one hundred and fifty wide, situated on opposite sides of
    a small creek, and tradition states that formerly they were connected
    by a bridge. They are five and six stories high.</p>

  <p>Besides the inhabited towns there are a number now unoccupied and fast
    going to decay. The names of these are given with slight variations
    by different writers; the following, however, are generally agreed
    upon: Pecos, Quivira, Valverda, San Lázaro, San Marcos, San Cristóbal,
    Socorro, Senacu, Abó, Quarra, Rita, Poblazon, old San Filipe, and old
    Zuñi.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> The most important of all these ruins is Pecos, one of the
    sacred cities of the pueblos. Here the everlasting fire dedicated to
    their god Montezuma was kept burning from time immemorial down to the
    abandonment of the town, which occurred some time during the second
    quarter of the present century. The reader will remember, however, that
    the culture-god of the Pueblos and the Aztec monarch are in no sense
    to be associated with each other, since it is quite certain that they
    were not confounded in the mythology of the worshippers of the deity.
    Whether the Pueblos, Cliff-dwellers, etc., were ever in any way related
    to the Aztecs or any Nahua people is difficult to determine. Certainly
    there is no architectural nor traditional evidence that they were.
    When the Spaniards under Coronado traversed the region in 1540 <span class="allsmcap">A.
    D.</span>, no reports of inter-communication between the two peoples seem
    to have been current. Father Escalante, who in 1776 visited many of the
    pueblos, and mentions many ruins not since located, as well as many
    inhabited towns now in ruins, found nothing to really substantiate the
    “Aztec theory.”<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> On the contrary, substantial arguments can <span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>be
    presented for the intimate relationship of the Nahuas and some of the
    Pueblos.</p>

  <p>In the tenth chapter of this work will be found the basis of linguistic
    affinities between the Nahua and Moqui languages, though none is
    claimed between the Nahua and New Mexican Pueblos. Mr. Becker, in his
    memoir addressed to the <cite>Congrès des Américanistes</cite> at Luxembourg,
    refers to Camergo’s account of the migration of the Teo-Chichimecs,
    the allies of the Toltecs, and to his statement that they came from
    <i>Amaquetepic</i> (“the mountains of the Amaques”), and expresses the
    belief that the words Amaques and Moquis are identical. Mr. Becker
    considers the “A” prefix of the former to be an abbreviation of the
    Nahua “atl” water, and Amaqui would mean the Maqui or Moqui living by
    the water, just as Acolhuas means Culhuas near the water and Anahuac,
    the Nahua land on the water. The tradition of the Moquis distinctly
    states that they formerly lived on the river at the north-east
    of their present home. The reader will remember that the Quichés
    called the Nahuas <i>Yaqui</i>, the name of a river of Sinaloa and
    Sonora where marked traces of the Nahua language are found, and the
    supposed locality of the first Toltec station. Is it not possible that
    <i>Yaqui</i> is a dialectic modification of Maqui or Moqui? It has been
    observed in the pages of this chapter that in more than one instance
    ruined pueblos were composed of either red adobe or had been painted, a
    circumstance which had won for them such a designation as “Red-house”
    or “Pueblo-pintado,” etc. Furthermore, the red glare of the desert
    north of the Moqui settlements has received the name of the “Painted
    desert.” The fact that Hue hue Tlapalan signifies “old red land” is
    suggestive that this locality may have been the mysterious rendezvous
    of the Toltecs. The Moquis like the Nahuas are sun-worshippers, though
    the ceremonial of both people differ considerably.</p>

  <p>Besides the mound-works observed on the upper San Juan by Mr. Holmes
    associated with the work of the Cliff-dwellers, recent exploration has
    shown that combinations of mound and pueblo features of architecture
    exist in Utah. Dr. C. C. Parry found in a mound on the St. Clara River
    in Southern Utah very fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span> specimens of Pueblo pottery, and other
    articles which clearly identify its architects with the people of the
    cliffs or with the village builders at the South.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> The recent
    exploration of several mounds in southern Utah by Dr. Edward Palmer
    fully confirms this conclusion. In Kane County, Utah, the same explorer
    discovered among a number of articles of apparent Moqui make in a
    cave-shelter, a shovel of horn having a blade fourteen inches long by
    five inches wide. Among the articles was a pair of shoes made of the
    fibre of the <i>Yucca</i>, which in style, shape, manner of braiding,
    etc., closely resemble shoes made of the leaves of the <i>Typa</i>
    found by Prof. F. W. Putnam in a cave in Kentucky.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

  <p>The mound examined by Mr. Barrand on the west fork of the Little Sioux
    of Dakota, and found to contain a large interior circular chamber,
    probably was the work of the ancestors of this western branch of the
    mound-building people.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> The circular chamber was much like an
    estufa.</p>

  <p>The many-sided culture-hero of the Pueblos, Montezuma, is the centre of
    a group of the most poetic myths found in Ancient American Mythology.
    The Pueblos believed in a supreme being, a good spirit, so exalted
    and worthy of reverence that his name was considered too sacred to
    mention, as, with the ancient Hebrews, Jehovah’s was the “unmentionable
    name.” Nevertheless Montezuma was the equal of this great spirit, and
    was often considered identical with the sun. The variety of aspects
    in which Montezuma is presented to us is due to the fact that each
    tribe of Pueblos had its particular legends concerning his birth and
    achievements. Many places in New Mexico claim the honor of his nativity
    at a period long before those village builders were acquainted with the
    arts of architecture, which have since given them their distinguishing
    name. In fact, this culture-god was none other than the genius who
    introduced the knowledge of building among them.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Some traditions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
    however, make him the ancestor and even the creator of the race;
    others, its prophet, leader and lawgiver. Mr. Bancroft says, “Under
    restrictions, we may fairly regard him as the Melchizedek, the Moses,
    and the Messiah of these Pueblo-desert wanderers from an Egypt that
    history is ignorant of, and whose name even tradition whispers not. He
    taught his people how to build cities with tall houses, to construct
    <i>Estufas</i>, or semi-sacred sweat-houses, and to kindle and guard
    the sacred fire.” It has been aptly remarked by Mr. Tyler, that
    Montezuma was the great “somebody” of the tribe to whom the qualities
    and achievements of every other were attributed.</p>

  <p>Fremont gives an account of the birth of the hero, in which his mother
    is declared to have been a woman of exquisite beauty, admired and
    sought for by all men. She was the recipient of rich presents of corn
    and skins from her admirers, yet she refused the hands of all her
    suitors. A famine soon occurred, and great distress followed. Now the
    fastidious beauty showed herself to be a lady of charitable spirit
    and tender heart. She opened her granaries, in which all her presents
    had been stored, and out of their abundance relieved the wants of
    the poor. The offerings of love were made to perform their mission a
    second time. At last, when the pure and plenteous rains again brought
    fertility to the earth, the summer shower fell upon the Pueblo goddess,
    and she gave birth to a son, the immortal Montezuma. The intelligent
    chief of the Papagoes, whose people occupy the territory between the
    Santa Cruz River and the Gulf of California, related a legend of the
    origin and offices of Montezuma, which, while it surprises the reader
    with its close resemblances to some leading points in the Hebrew and
    Chaldean genesis and deluge accounts, still is conspicuous for its
    inconsistencies, and in its closing statements for the absence of any
    knowledge of time or order.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span></p>

  <p>In substance it is as follows: The Great Spirit, having made all
    things—sky, earth, and the living creatures which inhabit it—descended
    into the earth for the purpose of creating man also. Digging in the
    earth, he found clay, such as a potter uses; this he carried back with
    him to his celestial abode, and dropped it again from the sky into the
    pit from which he had dug it. Instantly Montezuma, the genius of life,
    sprang from the pit, and became a partner in the creation of other men.
    The Apaches were the next formed, and were so wild that they severally
    ran away as fast as created. Those were golden days which followed the
    birth of the race; the sun was very much nearer the earth than now,
    and his grateful presence rendered clothing useless. A common language
    between all men, shared even by beasts, was one of the strongest
    possible bonds of peace.</p>

  <p>But at last this paradisiacal age was ended by a great deluge in
    which all men and living creatures perished. Only Montezuma and his
    friend, the coyote—a prairie-wolf—escaped. This wonderful animal, with
    semi-divine attributes, plays a remarkable part in the religion of many
    of the Pacific tribes, and furnishes us a parallel in our Occidental
    mythology with the half-human, half-brute combinations of Greco-Roman
    mythology. The coyote, gifted with prophetic powers, had foretold the
    approach of this great calamity, and Montezuma, heeding the warning,
    had built him a boat, which he kept in readiness on the summit of Santa
    Rosa. His sagacious friend, the coyote, also escaped in an ark made
    from a gigantic cane which grew by a river’s side; having gnawed it
    down and crawled into it, he stopped up the ends with gum, and escaped.
    When the waters subsided, the two met again on dry ground. Montezuma
    then employed the coyote on several wearisome excursions in order to
    discover the extent of the land, which developed the fact that upon the
    east and south and west the water yet remained. Only on the north was
    there land.</p>

  <p>The Great Spirit and Montezuma again created men and animals, and the
    former committed to his partner in the work the duties of governing
    the new race. These were, however, neglected by Montezuma, who became
    puffed up with pride, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span> permitted all manner of wickedness to
    prevail. The Great Spirit remonstrated with him, even descending
    to the earth for the purpose of moving his faithless and haughty
    vicegerent to restore order, but with no avail. Then, returning to
    his abode in heaven, he pushed the sun back to a remote part of the
    sky as a punishment on the race. At this, Montezuma became enraged,
    collected the tribes around him, and set about the construction of a
    house which should reach heaven. The builders had already completed
    several apartments, lined with gold and silver and precious stones,
    and progressed to a point which encouraged all to believe that their
    defiant purpose would be accomplished, when the Great Spirit smote it
    to the earth amid the crash of his thunder. Here the account becomes
    very confused—a great leap is made from Montezuma the culture-hero to
    Montezuma the emperor, and the two become confounded.</p>

  <p>The legend states that upon the defeat of his rebellious scheme,
    Montezuma still hardened his heart, and caused the sacred images to
    be dragged through the streets for the derision of the villagers; the
    temples were desecrated, and defiance to the Supreme declared. As a
    punishment, the Great Spirit caused an insect to fly toward the east to
    an unknown land, to bring the Spaniards, who utterly destroyed him.</p>

  <p>The post-diluvian part of this story presents the hero in quite another
    light than that generally accepted by most of the Pueblo tribes, in
    which he is represented as having been the very model of goodness and
    beneficence—the founder of their cities, of which Acoma was the first
    and Pecos the second. Before taking his departure from his people,
    he prophesied that they should suffer from drought and from the
    oppressions of a strange nation, but promised them to return as their
    deliverer. He then planted a tree upside down, and bade them preserve
    the sacred fire notwithstanding their misfortunes, until the tree fell,
    at which time he would return with a white race, who would destroy all
    their enemies and bring back the fertile showers.</p>

  <p>It is said that this tree fell from its place as the American army
    entered Santa Fé, in 1846. In the cramped, subterranean estufa, the
    Pueblo fed the sacred fire burning in the basin of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span> small altar. It
    was a warrior’s vigil, for by turns their heroes descended into its
    suffocating atmosphere, thick with smoke, and charged with carbonic
    acid, to wait often for two successive days and nights without
    refreshment, often even until death relieved the guard.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

  <p>For generations these strange architects and faithful priests have
    waited for the return of their god—looked for him to come with the sun,
    and descend by the column of smoke which rose from the sacred fire. As
    of old the Israelitish watcher upon Mount Seir replied to the inquiry,
    “What of the night?” “The morning cometh,” so the Pueblo sentinel
    mounts the house-top at Pecos, and gazes wistfully into the east for
    the golden appearance, for the rapturous vision of his redeemer, for
    Montezuma’s return; and, though no ray of light meets his watching eye,
    his never-failing faith, with cruel deception, replies, “The morning
    cometh.”<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Explorations among the Pueblos.</span>—In the summer of 1879
      the Smithsonian Institution undertook a thorough and extensive
      examination of the Pueblo civilization of New Mexico and Arizona.
      Major Powell sent an expedition to New Mexico in charge of Mr.
      James Stevenson, and a large collection illustrative of the
      manners and customs of the Pueblos was made. Mr. F. H. Cushing was
      especially fortunate in obtaining minute information concerning
      their traditions, rites, and ceremonies. The work of investigation
      is still in progress, and at this writing (September, 1881) an
      expedition is in the field. A full report will ultimately be
      published. During the latter half of the year 1880 Mr. Baudelier,
      the eminent Mexican scholar, visited Taos, and prepared a paper
      on that interesting locality for the Archæological Institute of
      America, under whose patronage his exploration was conducted.
      During a residence of two months in the Pueblo of Cochití, occupied
      by a branch of the Queres tribe, Mr. Baudelier made a thorough
      study of the institutions of that interesting people. See Second

  <p class="drop-cap">WITHOUT pretending to furnish an exhaustive treatment of the subject
    proposed for this chapter, we desire to make observations on some
    phases of the development of American civilization in the Pre-Historic
    period. One of the most natural fruits of the study of the arts and
    customs of any people, is a disposition on the part of the investigator
    to institute a comparison with corresponding features of civilization
    in all parts of the world. Unfortunately this disposition has led many
    writers on America into wild and fanciful speculations, which tend only
    to deceive the reader and add nothing to true investigation. In a few
    instances pronounced old world analogies have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span> been proven to exist in
    ancient American institutions and arts, but their number bears a small
    ratio to the multitude of fancied analogies which never existed, except
    in the imaginations of their discoverers. To discuss the subject in
    hand without transcending the limits of the period which is treated in
    previous chapters, namely, the Primitive period—that which antedates
    the era of the annals of those ancient peoples, is a somewhat difficult
    task, since the question of dates is a very uncertain one in the
    absence of any sufficient key to the hieroglyphic and picture records.
    The customs and political organization, together with the Aztec
    civilization, have been often treated, and by none better than our own
    Prescott and Bancroft. The repetition of their labors here would be
    highly superfluous. We shall, however, ask the attention of the reader
    to some considerations upon the following divisions of the subject:</p>

  <p>1. <span class="smcap">Architecture.</span> 2. <span class="smcap">Sculpture</span> and
    <span class="smcap">Hieroglyphics</span>. 3. <span class="smcap">Chronological</span> and <span class="smcap">Astronomical
    Knowledge</span>. 4. <span class="smcap">Religious Analogies.</span></p>

  <p><i>Architecture.</i>—The works of the Mound-builders and Pueblos have
    already been described and their transitional forms or stages noted.
    To seek for parallelisms or analogies between the Mound-builders and
    the people of Asia because mounds are common to both continents, or
    to seek to identify them with the people of Northern Europe because
    the shell-heaps of our sea-board resemble those of Denmark, would
    certainly be an unjustifiable use of the imagination, in anything
    like a serious discussion of the question. We have no disposition
    to speculate on this subject, since such speculation cannot furnish
    any satisfactory results. Certain resemblances between American and
    Hindoo-mounds have been supposed to exist, but the resemblance, if
    any, proves nothing.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> That more fruitful and wonderful field of
    ancient architecture in Central America, Yucatan and Mexico, furnishes
    abundant opportunity for the discussion of our subject. Detailed
    descriptions of the remains found in different localities <span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>have been
    given by travelers, artists and authors, the latter availing themselves
    of several accounts and instituting comparisons between the statements
    of different explorers. Such works, savoring somewhat of the critical,
    cannot be underrated, since their development of the true facts has
    contributed largely to our knowledge of the subject. It has been
    generally the rule for writers to undertake the description of remains
    in a particular locality and treat them in detail, thus presenting to
    the mind a pleasant picture of the whole, together with the relation
    of parts. This is certainly a satisfactory plan to many readers,
    but it seems to us that such a course is unnecessary, after it has
    been once pursued by the explorer. By repetitions nothing is gained,
    unless the work of classification (by which certain architectural
    forms and methods are woven into a style and their variations noted)
    receives attention. In preceding chapters we have treated of the Maya,
    the Quiché, and the Nahua peoples, and in this, it is our purpose
    to briefly note the main features of their styles of architecture,
    sculpture, etc., as indicated in the divisions above laid down.</p>

  <p><i>Maya Architecture</i> furnishes evidence of growth, and may be
    classified into the Chiapan or ancient and the Yucatanic or modified
    styles. The Chiapan or ancient style is exhibited in the imposing
    remains of Palenque, with which the reader is supposed to be already
    familiar, from the descriptions of several explorers.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Palenque
    is situated in the Usumacinta River region in Chiapas, on a small
    stream sometimes called the Otolum, a tributary of the Tulija, which
    is itself a branch of the Usumacinta. The ruins are situated in a
    small valley of the foothills, from which rise the high table-lands
    of the interior. They are known as the Palace, with a pyramidal base
    measuring two hundred and sixty by three hundred and ten feet and forty
    feet high; Temple of the three Tablets; Temple of the Beau Relief;
    Temple of the Cross, and Temple of the Sun. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>most conspicuous
    feature of the architecture employed, and seen in most of the Central
    American structures, is the massive pyramidal foundation. The sides of
    the pyramid of the Palenque palace are faced with regular blocks of
    hewn stone, with extensive flights of stairs, upon the east and north
    leading to its summit.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> Mr. Bancroft has analyzed the structure
    of the American pyramid in a philosophical way, and no doubt has in
    part explained its object. “I think,” he remarks, “that perhaps with
    a view to raise this place or temple above the waters of the stream,
    four thick walls, possibly more, were built up perpendicularly from the
    ground to the desired height; then, after the completion of the walls,
    to strengthen them, or during the progress of the work to facilitate
    the raising of the stones, the interior was filled with earth, and the
    exterior graded with the same material, the whole being subsequently
    faced with hewn stone.”<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Mode of Constructing Pyramid.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In the above cut Mr. Bancroft illustrates his opinion. Stephens
    and Waldeck, who excavated from the summit downwards, imply that
    the interior D is of earth. Twenty years later Charnay found a
    perpendicular wall on the eastern side, quite contrary to the
    observations of all previous travelers. Mr. Bancroft accounts for this
    on the supposition that the stone facing, loosened by the growth of
    trees which covered it, had fallen from B to F, and that the earth
    which filled the sides at E E had been washed away by the rain and left
    the perpendicular wall <span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>exposed at B. Such a supposition we consider to
    be perfectly probable in view of the rapid dilapidation of the ruins
    since Dupaix’s visit in 1806. The ancient model thus established in
    the construction of this, perhaps oldest of existing American cities,
    may have determined the style of many similar edifices. A plan of the
    palace has been furnished by several authors.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> The accompanying
    restoration from Armin’s <cite>Das Heutige Mexiko</cite>, employed by
    Mr. Bancroft, may serve to give an idea of the proportions of the
    structure. The edifice occupies the entire summit platform of the
    pyramid except a narrow passage-way around the edge, and measures 228
    feet by 182, and about 30 feet in height. The doorways, of which there
    are forty in the outer wall, are wider than the piers intervening
    between them, and were constructed originally with flat wooden lintels,
    all of which have disappeared. The main architectural features will <span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>be
    observed in the accompanying plate from Waldeck. The lower right-hand
    figure shows the angle of the foundations of one of the interior
    buildings and the manner in which the stones were laid. The left-hand
    figure affords a sectional view of the eastern stairway descending
    from the principal corridor into the grand court. It will be observed
    that the height of the steps considerably exceeds their width. Waldeck
    illustrates this singular disproportion by a diagram in which a native
    is represented as sitting upon the stairway. The perpendicular face of
    a step is shown to be considerably higher than the Indian’s knee, and
    must have measured two feet. The upper left-hand figures represent the
    forms of niches, which are of frequent occurrence. The T shaped niche
    is the representative of a numerous class so resembling the Egyptian
    <i>tau</i> or cross as to excite no little interest in its origin.
    M. Waldeck found the marks of lamp-black upon the tops of some of
    them, and supposes them to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span> held torches which illuminated the
    corridors; others, which extend through the walls, may have served for
    the purposes of ventilation; while others perhaps contained idols.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
    The right-hand upper figures represent the highly artistic double
    cornices employed. Nothing of a definite nature is known of the style
    of roof with which the palace was covered, since every vestige of it
    has disappeared. Castañeda represents it as sloping and plastered,
    while Dupaix refers to it as consisting of large stone flags, carefully
    joined together.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Architectural Features at Palenque.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The neighboring buildings, such as the Temple of the Three Tablets,
    the Temple of the Cross, and the Temple of the Sun, each have
    well-preserved roofs of masonry, which are quite remarkable. The first
    of these stands upon its lofty pyramidal base, measuring one hundred
    and ten feet on the slope, with continuous steps on all sides. The
    temple, which is thirty-five feet high, is crowned with a sloping
    ornamental roof of great beauty. Stephens illustrated the temple in
    several views, subsequently copied by Bancroft.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> The roof is
    divided into three parts; the lower section recedes from the cornice
    with a gentle slope, and resembles the corresponding section of a
    French or Mansard roof. The stucco decorations of this lower section,
    which is also painted, add considerably to the general effect. Five
    solid square projections with perpendicular faces suggestive of the
    attic windows of a modern French roof are found on this section,
    corresponding to the several doors of the temple immediately below. The
    second section, which slopes back at a more acute angle, is of solid
    masonry. The crowning section seems to have been purely ornamental,
    consisting of a line of pillars of stone and mortar, eighteen inches
    high and twelve inches apart, surmounted by a layer of flat stones
    with projecting sides. The Temple of the Cross and Temple of the Sun
    both have roof-structures which may be described as resembling a
    lattice-work of stone.</p>

  <p>The most interesting feature of Palenque architecture is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>the arch, of
    which there are two styles, if one of them may be classed as an arch
    at all; of this we have doubts. The style to which we allude is that
    which has been designated as the Yucatan arch. A section of the double
    corridor of the palace furnishes an example as shown in the cut from
    Mr. Bancroft’s work.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp55">
    <img src="The%20North%20Americans%20of%20Antiquity,%20by%20John%20T.%20Short_files/i_345.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="caption smcap">Section of Palace Corridor.</div>
  </div>

  <p>This so-called arch is nothing more than the approach of two walls
    toward each other in straight lines, nearly forming an acute angle at
    the top. These inclining walls are constructed of overlapping stones,
    with a small surface of exposed ceiling, produced by a lintel-like
    covering. The principal doorway, which is eighteen feet high, is
    constructed in the form of a trefoil arch, while niches or depressions
    of the same trefoil form are ranged along the inclined face of the
    gallery on each side of the entrance. This arch is suggestive of the
    Moorish pattern, though the latter probably is the more modern. The
    accompanying cut—a photographic reduction from Waldeck—will convey a
    clear idea of its form.</p>

  <p>The tower situated in the southern court is considered by Waldeck as
    the crowning work of all. The frontispiece is a photographic reduction
    from Waldeck’s drawing, and no doubt indicates the true number of its
    stories, as well as the remarkable growth of vegetation upon its roof.
    The descent of the little roots and tendrils of the trees above in
    quest of nourishment, furnish a striking illustration of the luxuriant
    vegetable growth which pervades the region. The very air is laden with
    life, though the remains of man’s handicraft and power are but the
    lifeless monuments of his vanished glory. The gentle evening breeze
    which plays upon the tendrils stretching themselves down the tower’s
    wall, produces a soft melodious sound, resembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span> that of the Æolian
    harp, and gives rise to the apprehension in the minds of the natives
    that the place is enchanted.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Trefoil Arch, Palenque.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The second division of Maya architecture, namely, the Yucatan or
    modified style, presents some variations from the ancient <span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>or Chiapan.
    Probably the most remarkable group of ruins in that richest of American
    architectural fields—Yucatan—is situated at Uxmal, in Lat. 20° 27′ 30″,
    thirty-five miles south of Merida. The reader is of course acquainted
    with the detail of the survey of this remarkable city of antiquity
    through the work of Stephens and Catherwood.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> These indefatigable
    explorers examined about forty ruined cities, nearly all of which were
    previously unknown to others than the natives, and many of them were
    unknown at Merida, the capital of the country. While these travelers
    are pre-eminently the explorers of Yucatan, there are others whose
    services have been of great value in the same field.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

  <p>Mr. Bancroft has divided the architectural remains in Yucatan into
    four groups, classifying them geographically. We do not consider
    it necessary to follow such a course, nor enter into the detailed
    description of any group, but will content ourselves by simply noting
    any variations from the Palenque models. At Uxmal our attention is at
    once arrested by the irregular pyramidal base of the building known
    as the Casa del Gobernador. The base of the pyramid is a figure of an
    irregular rectangular form. The northern and eastern sides of the base
    are equal, and measure about six hundred feet each; the southern and
    western are, however, irregular. As all the angles are right angles,
    and two contiguous sides are equal, it will be understood that the
    figure of the base would have been a square, but for the irregularity
    of the remaining two sides. These irregularities fall within the
    figure of the square. The pyramid is terraced, the first promenade
    when observed being but three feet from the ground. The second terrace
    rises from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>this to a height of twenty feet, and supports a platform
    with sides 545 feet in length. A trifle west of the centre of this
    platform rises the third terrace, nineteen feet high, and supporting
    the summit platform, measuring about 100 by 360 feet, with an
    elevation above the ground of upwards of forty feet.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> The pyramid
    is composed of fragments of limestone thrown together, but with the
    terraces substantially faced with walls of regular and smoothly-hewn
    limestone-blocks, laid in mortar <span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>which has become intensely hard.
    The corners of the pyramid differ from those usually met with in that
    they are rounded. The terrace walls incline slightly toward the centre
    of the pyramid. The second platform was reached by a long inclined
    plain on the south side one hundred feet wide. A regular stairway with
    thirty-five steps, and one hundred and thirty feet wide, furnished the
    means of ascent from the second platform to the summit. The crowning
    feature of the structure is the Casa del Gobernador, a characteristic
    Yucatan building, measuring three hundred and twenty-two feet long
    but only thirty-nine feet wide. The Casa is surrounded by a promenade
    thirty feet wide, and in its interior contains two parallel rows of
    apartments (a plan of which is given by Mr. Stephens).<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> A sectional
    view of the Casa resembles the sectional view of the palace corridors
    at Palenque, except that in the arches conspicuous in the latter, the
    irregularities produced by the square overlapping stones (which are
    filled up to an even surface by mortar and plastering), are avoided in
    Yucatan, by the overlapping stones of the arch being dressed carefully
    to the angle of inclination of the wall or ceiling, thus presenting
    a smooth surface. The roof is formed by filling in the space between
    the tops of the arches and between the arches and the outer walls with
    stone, up to the desired level; after which a perfectly flat covering
    of well-cut stones is laid over the whole, having a neat though small
    projecting cornice, as will be observed in the accompanying cut from
    Bancroft’s work. The rear wall is about nine feet thick and perfectly
    solid. The comparative modernness of the building may be realized when
    we state that Mr. Stephens found the top of each doorway supported
    by a heavy beam of zapote-wood. One of these, which was elaborately
    and beautifully carved, and measuring ten feet long and ten by twenty
    inches wide, he brought to New York, where, unfortunately, it was
    destroyed by fire with the remainder of his collection. It is presumed
    that the zapote-wood was prized for its rarity, as it is not found at
    present <span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>near Uxmal. Inside of and above the doors of the Casa were
    stone rings, which occur frequently in Yucatec structures, and are
    supposed to have supported curtains for closing the doorways. Stephens
    presents in a cut (<a href="#i_346">page 346</a>) a view of the imposing and elegant front
    looking toward the south.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

  </div>

  <p>Of the several Uxmal edifices, one especially demands attention as
    representing the highest state of ancient architecture and sculpture
    in America. This is known as the Casa de Monjas, or Nunnery, and is
    situated nearly three hundred yards north of the Casa del Gobernador,
    on a pyramid with three terraces, and measuring three hundred and
    fifty feet square at its base. On the summit platform, only nineteen
    feet above the level of the ground, stand four of the characteristic
    Yucatan buildings upon four sides of a nearly square court. The
    northern building does not stand quite parallel to the building on the
    opposite side of the court. The plan from Stephens will present clearly
    the arrangement of the apartments, in which it will be observed that
    of the eighty-eight rooms contained in the Casa de Monjas, not more
    than two apartments open into each other, except in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>one instance,
    which occurs in the eastern front.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> The court formed by these long
    narrow edifices measures 258 by 214 feet, and according to M. Waldeck
    was paved with 43,660 blocks of stone six inches square. In the centre
    stood the fragments of a rude column similar to others observed in the
    Casa del Gobernador.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

  <p>A cut of one of the beautifully sculptured façades of the Casa <span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>de
    Monjas will be found on a future page. Near the Casa de Monjas stands
    the pyramid and edifice generally known as the Casa del Adivino or
    Prophet’s house, and named by M. Waldeck the Pyramid de Kingsborough.
    The pyramid rises to a height of 80 feet from a base of 155 by 235
    feet. The corners are rounded, and the sides, which are carefully faced
    with cubical blocks of stone, rise so steep that the ascent and descent
    by the grand stairway on the eastern face is giddy and dangerous. The
    stairway measuring one hundred and two feet on the slope is inclined at
    an angle of eighty degrees.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

  <p>About a dozen miles south-eastward from Uxmal are the remains of the
    ancient city known as Kabah, where ruins quite similar and nearly
    as extensive as those already described are found. However, new
    architectural features here meet the observer. In one instance the
    structure which surmounts a terraced pyramid is square, instead of
    long and narrow as at Uxmal. The inner rooms of the edifice have
    floors two feet higher than the floors of the outer rooms, and are
    entered by two stone steps. In one instance these were cut from a
    single block with the lower step in the form of a scroll. At Kabah
    we meet with an entirely new feature in Maya architecture, and the
    reader’s acquaintance with the terraced casas, of the New Mexican
    region, will supply the lack of an illustration at this point. In the
    style of building referred to, the pyramid instead of serving as a
    foundation for the building, serves as a central support around which
    the house with its receding stories, one above another, is built. The
    first story of the building referred to is built upon the ground, with
    the perpendicular sides of a mound for its rear wall. Just above,
    on a level with the roof of the first story on the platform of the
    first terrace of the mound, stands the second story, with the roof
    of the first serving as a promenade in front of it, while the third
    story rests upon the second platform of the mound. The platforms or
    roofs of the first and second stories are reached by means of a stone
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>stairway supported upon a half arch. The first story is accessible
    from the ground by doorways. The interior apartments are constructed
    on the model of the Yucatec arch. Here, however, lintels of stone are
    met with, supported in the centre by rude stone columns surmounted by
    square capitals. These buildings are of large proportions, equalling
    any we have thus far described. The decorations of the edifices were
    considered by Mr. Stephens equal to those of any known era, even when
    tried by the severest rules of art.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> At Zayi, one of the finest
    illustrations of this style of architecture is to be seen in what is
    known as the Casa Grande. The dimensions of the Casa Grande are as
    follows: lower story, 120 by 265 feet; the second story, 60 by 220
    feet; and the third, resting on the summit platform of the mound, 18
    by 150 feet; a stairway thirty-two feet wide furnishes a means of
    ascent to the third story on the front, while a narrow stairway leads
    to the second story at the rear. Round columns both in doorways and
    the façade constitute the chief variation from the styles already
    observed. An “elephant trunk” ornament protruding from the cornice
    (also found on Casa del Gobernador and the Casa de Monjas at Uxmal) is
    a marked feature of decoration. It is unnecessary for us to say that
    its presence has given rise to much speculation as to its origin. M.
    Waldeck has given the figure the name which we have applied to it, and
    perhaps with some reason.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

  <p>At Labná ruins of a curious and extraordinary nature exist, though far
    gone in decay. The accompanying cut, employed in Stephens’, Baldwin’s
    and Bancroft’s works, will serve to show the extravagant decoration
    lavished upon the cornices of the edifices. At Chichen-Itza, the
    so-called “Nunnery” is supported by a solid mass of masonry, with
    perpendicular walls. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>The dimensions of this base are one hundred and
    twelve by one hundred and sixty feet and forty-two feet high. This was
    crowned by a building having two receding stories. The great pyramid
    of Chichen is celebrated for the solid stone balustrade which guards
    its northern stairway of ninety steps, forty-four feet wide. These
    balustrades terminate in colossal serpent heads, ten feet long.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
    Both at Chichen and at Mayapan circular structures are met with and
    are figured by Stephens.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> The same author has described the
    rectangular watch-towers of Tuloom, which rise majestically amid the
    extensive ruins of the ancient city of the same name, situated upon the
    eastern coast in latitude 20° 10´. At Tuloom, Mr. Stephens (its only
    describer), found the first walled city in Yucatan. He believes it to
    have been occupied long after the conquest, and probably was one of the
    cities whose many towers met the gaze of the wondering Spaniards, who
    beheld them as they coasted along the shore.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

  <p><i>Quiché Architecture.</i>—The propriety of classifying the great
    ruins of Honduras and Guatemala as Quiché in their origin and style,
    may be questioned by some of our readers. It must be admitted that
    great contrasts in style are found in this region, which was occupied
    by the powerful kingdom of the Quichés and Cakchiquels, at the time
    of the conquest. However, it is probable that the ancient Quichés
    (who, as we have already seen, at an early day developed a religion
    and literature), were the authors of the more ancient cities, like
    Copan and Quirigua. The Quiché-Cakchiquels of more modern times were
    quite another people, whose institutions, language, and no doubt their
    architecture, had been largely influenced by Nahua people from the
    Mexican plateau. Utatlan, the magnificent capital of this modern and
    mixed people, was in the height of its glory just before the blighting
    power of the conquerors laid it in ruins. As ours is not an attempt at
    the history of discovery, we omit entirely that interesting feature
    in the treatment of antiquities, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>and call attention at once to the
    features conspicuous in Quiché architecture. The ancient city known as
    Copan, on the eastern bank of a river of the same name, in latitude
    14° 45´ and longitude 90° 52´ in Honduras, and four leagues from the
    Guatemala line, is interesting in furnishing material for study in this
    department. It is probably the most ancient city on the continent.
    Copan no doubt could successfully contend with Palenque for the palm of
    antiquity. It is again to the indefatigable Stephens and the skillful
    Catherwood that we are most indebted for our knowledge of these
    ruins.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> The period of the abandonment of Copan is a question with
    reference to which we possess too few data to render an intelligent
    decision concerning it. Following the example of Stephens and Bancroft,
    we first introduce the account of Fuentes contained in Juarros.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>
    “In the year 1700, the great circus of Copan still remained entire.
    This was a circular space, surrounded by stone pyramids about <span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>six
    yards high and very well constructed; at the base of these pyramids
    were figures, both male and female, of very excellent sculpture, which
    then retained the colors they had been enameled with; and what was
    not less remarkable, the whole of them were habited in the Castilian
    costume. In the middle of this area, elevated above a flight of steps,
    was the place of sacrifice. The same author (Fuentes) relates that,
    a short distance from the circus, there was a portal constructed of
    stone, on the columns of which were the figures of men, likewise
    represented in Spanish habits, with hose, ruff round the neck, sword,
    cap, and short cloak. On entering the gateway there are two fine
    stone pyramids, moderately large and lofty, from which is suspended
    a hammock that contains two human figures, one of each sex, clothed
    in the Indian style. Astonishment is forcibly excited in viewing this
    structure, because, large as it is, there is no appearance of the
    component parts being joined together; and although entirely of stone
    and of an enormous weight, it may be put in motion by the slightest
    impulse of the hand. Not far from this hammock is the cave of Tibulca;
    this appears like a temple of great size hollowed out of the base of a
    hill, and adorned with columns having bases, pedestals, capitals and
    crowns, all accurately adjusted according to architectural principles;
    at the sides are numerous windows faced with stone exquisitely wrought.
    All these circumstances lead to a belief that there must have been some
    intercourse between the inhabitants of the old and new world at very
    remote periods.” The swinging stone hammock is probably a work of the
    fancy rather than that of the artist’s hand, though the padre at Gualan
    told Stephens that he had seen it, and an Indian remembered to have
    heard his grandfather speak of it. None of these remarkable remains
    have been identified with certainty, though it is not improbable
    that they might be discovered if the heavy growth of vegetation were
    removed by a conflagration and explorers to extend their observations
    farther from the banks of the Rio Copan. According to Stephens’ survey,
    a wall encloses a rectangular area measuring about nine hundred by
    sixteen hundred feet. The principal group of buildings is designated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
    as the temple. It is built of heavy blocks of cut stone, with walls
    of about twenty-five feet in thickness, and when examined they were
    between sixty and ninety feet high on the river’s bank. The temple
    measured six hundred and twenty-four feet north and south by eight
    hundred and nine feet east and west. The general feature of the ruin
    is that of an immense pyramidal terrace, with a platform elevated
    about seventy feet above the ground. The river side of the terrace
    is perpendicular, while the remaining sides are sloping; viewing the
    ruin from this general platform seventy feet high, depressions such
    as amphitheatre-like courts descend from it in some instances thirty
    or forty feet, or about half way to the level of the ground, while
    above the level of the general platform pyramidal structures rise to
    a considerable height, in one instance one hundred and twenty-two
    feet. It is difficult to conceive of what might have been the nature
    of the superstructure, if any surmounted the general platform. It is
    probable that for the purposes of assembly the amphitheatres with their
    sloping sides may have answered every purpose, while the pyramids
    may have been surmounted by temples now in ruins. Of the sculptured
    columns of this locality we will speak farther on. Utatlan, the former
    capital of the modern Quiché kingdom, would naturally be selected as
    a point at which to seek for remains of the newer Quiché styles of
    architecture. The conquerors, however, left little that can serve
    as the basis for architectural study. The city was surrounded by a
    deep ravine or barranca, which can be crossed at only one point, and
    there long lines of stone fortifications still guard the passage. A
    fortress, called El Resguardo, is among these works. It rises one
    hundred and twenty feet high in the form of a terraced pyramid, with
    a stone wall plastered with cement enclosing its summit platform,
    on which a circular tower provided with a stairway was built. Only
    fragmentary walls of the Quiché palaces remain; their dimensions were
    eleven hundred by twenty-two hundred feet, and nothing but their cement
    covered floors have survived the vandalism of the conquerors and the
    architects of the modern town; the latter having carried away the upper
    portions for building purposes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span> A pyramidal structure near by, known
    as El Sacrificatorio, presents no architectural contrasts to pyramids
    already described. Its stairway, composed of nineteen steps each eight
    inches broad and seventeen inches high, is characteristically Central
    American.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> In the province of Vera Paz, especially in the Rabinal
    Valley, Brasseur de Bourbourg observed numbers of tumuli, resembling
    those of the Mississippi Valley both in material and structure. These
    were especially prevalent in the neighborhood of the villages, and
    sometimes were associated with pyramidal structures equal in finish
    to any we have described. The name <i>cakhay</i>, “red houses,” is
    generally applied to these tumuli.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

  <p><i>Nahua Architecture.</i>—It would be quite impossible for us to
    devote that space to this subject which the number of remains would
    justify, and the presentation of the typal features of the architecture
    of that interesting family of nations will be all that we shall here
    attempt; of geographical and detailed treatments there are several
    on the different departments of the subject.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> In the pages which
    follow we will select a few examples of Nahua architecture in order to
    illustrate our subject, but we would state that many equally important
    works, though perhaps presenting no new features, have been purposely
    passed by unnoticed. In a preceding chapter we referred to those
    intermediate nations which occupied the transition position between
    the Mayas and Nahuas. The Miztecs, Zapotecs and others, were probably
    a mixed people, related in different degrees to both of the great
    families on the north and south of them. Oajaca and Guerrero were the
    homes of these peoples, where they developed their own civilization
    and styles of art in channels distinct from those of their neighbors.
    The isthmus of Tehuantepec presents some interesting remains, chief
    among <span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>which we may cite two stone pyramids situated three leagues west
    of the city of Tehuantepec. One of these measures fifty-five by one
    hundred and twenty feet at the base and thirty by sixty-six feet on the
    summit. A grand stairway composed of forty steps and thirty feet in
    width leads up the western slope. The summit is also made accessible by
    smaller stairways on the north and south sides. The lower of the four
    terraces composing the structure, is perpendicular; the others have
    inclined walls. On the face of the second terrace were four ranges of
    flat stones, one above another, extending entirely around the pyramid
    and furnishing a series of shelves, devoted no doubt to some sacred
    or sacrificial use. The whole structure was plastered with a cement,
    colored brilliantly by red ochre. The adjoining pyramid presents an
    architectural novelty in its gracefully curved sides. Castañeda has
    sketched and Dupaix described it. The height of the pyramid is over
    fifty feet while its general dimensions are about the same as those of
    its neighbor. In close proximity to the pyramids, altar-like structures
    were observed, one of which was composed of eight circular stones,
    like mill-stones, placed one above another. The base measured ten and
    a half feet, but the summit only four and a half feet; the height
    measures twelve feet.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Numerous earthen tumuli resembling those of
    the Mississippi Valley were observed by the German traveler Müller,
    scattered over the region, especially to the south-east.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> The most
    important group of ruins in Oajoca is that at Mitla, situated about
    thirty miles south-east of the capital of the State. This is probably
    the finest group of remains north of the isthmus of Tehauntepec.
    Still they are not purely Nahua in their style, being, according to
    tradition, the work of the Zapotecs. This group has been described
    several times by explorers, whose accounts have differed considerably
    in value. The most important of these are the descriptions <span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>and
    drawings by Dupaix and Castañeda, made in 1806, and the description and
    valuable photographs by Charnay, the latest explorer of this group,
    whose work was performed in 1859.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

  <p>The mitla ruins are distributed into four groups of buildings
    (generally called palaces or temples) and two pyramids. The principal
    edifice is described as follows: three low oblong mounds only six or
    eight feet high but surmounted by stone buildings, enclose a court.
    The court measures 130 by 120 feet. The eastern and western buildings
    are in a fallen and ruined condition. The northern building, however,
    presents a singular example of ancient grandeur. The southern portion
    measures 36 by 130 feet, and the northern 61 feet square. The edifice
    is about eighteen feet high, having walls varying from four to nine
    feet in thickness. The accompanying cut, a photographic reduction of
    Charnay’s photograph, gives a correct idea of the western façade of the
    northern building.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

  <p>The walls of this edifice are constructed in a somewhat novel manner,
    their interior portions being nothing more than clay intermixed with
    stones, thus furnishing a poor substitute for the cement and stone
    filling in the inner parts of Yucatanic walls. However, the exterior
    facing of the walls is of hewn stone blocks <span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>cut in different forms
    and sizes, and so set in relation to each other as to present examples
    of perhaps the finest variety of grecques found in any structure in
    the world.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Two layers of large stone blocks form the base of the
    palace, from which rises buttresses and a framework of stone, filled
    in with panels of mosaic, in patterns as described. We pronounce these
    grecque patterns mosaics, because of the manner of their structure.
    They are not of the nature of sculpture, since each pattern, with all
    its regularity, is composed of small brick-shaped blocks of stone built
    into the wall, mosaic-like, thus forming the graceful patterns shown in
    the cut. No trace of mortar has been found at Mitla. The inner surface
    of the wall in the northern building was smoothly plastered without any
    ornament. Six round stone columns standing in line occupy the centre
    of the apartment, and no doubt supported a roof of wood or stone, but
    more probably of the former.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> The cut in Baldwin’s work, copied by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>Bancroft showing the interior of the apartment and the six columns,
    conveys an incorrect impression as to the form of the columns and the
    character of the walls, as is proven by Charnay’s photograph.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
    The façades of the inner court of the northern wing of the palace
    are finished with mosaics of great beauty. Four or five feet of the
    wall is plain at the bottom except that the plastering was evidently
    frescoed in various colors. The remainder of the wall is decorated with
    bands of mosaic grecques, as shown in the cut, which is a fac-simile
    of Charnay’s photograph engraven for Mr. Bancroft’s work. We should
    not fail to note the use of immense stones in the base, framework
    and lintels of the southern wing of the building. One of these is
    of granite, sixteen or nineteen feet long, with the pattern of the
    adjacent grecques sculptured on its face. None of the other buildings
    at Mitla present any architectural contrasts to the one already
    described, and require no special attention. Under a temple on the
    south-west side of the one we have just referred to, is a subterranean
    gallery, constructed in the form of a cross. The opening is at the
    base of the mound upon which the temple stands. The arms of the cross
    pointing toward the East, North and West, are each twelve feet long,
    five and a half feet wide, and six and a half feet high. The southern
    arm is, however, about twenty feet long, and not more than four feet
    high throughout most of its length. Near the centre of the cross (which
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>lies directly under the centre of the temple above) a flight of four
    steps descends in the southern arm of the cross to a lower level, so
    that the southern arm of the passage is somewhat lower than the others.
    The entire subterranean chamber was roofed with large flat stones
    reaching from side to side. The walls, besides being painted red, were
    ornamented with panels of mosaic, but of a ruder style than that of the
    superstructure, which is suggestive of an earlier period in the growth
    of the art. A circular pillar resting on a square base, and called by
    the natives “the pillar of death,” because of the belief entertained
    among them that whoever embraced it would immediately die, supports
    the large flagstone which covers the intersection of the galleries. An
    immense fortification over a mile in circumference and with stone walls
    six feet thick and eighteen feet high crowns the summit of a hill,
    which stands three-fourths of a league south-west of Mitla. The place
    was inaccessible except on the side toward the village where the wall
    was double. Castañeda has delineated and Bancroft copied the plan of
    this fortress.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

  <p>Passing into the state of Vera Cruz, the attention of the observer
    is arrested by great numbers of mounds of all the varieties peculiar
    to the Mississippi Valley. Excavations have yielded pottery of burnt
    clay, idols, and flint and stone weapons, as well as implements of
    agriculture, but no trace of iron or copper is recorded. As the Nahuas
    are said by Duran and Sahagun to have landed on the Gulf coast not far
    north of this region, and to have traversed it in their wanderings
    southward, and since the tradition derives them from Florida, it is not
    improbable that here we see the continuation of the works of the lower
    Mississippi.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

  <p>Of several interesting specimens of ancient architecture in the state
    of Vera Cruz we have selected a few examples. At Puente <span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>Nacional the
    remarkable pyramid shown in the cut is situated. It was described by
    J. M. Esteva in the <cite>Museo Mexicano</cite> in 1843. The pyramid is
    six stories high, and the eastern side is faced by a grand stairway
    in the form of a cross. Mr. Bancroft has described it, employing the
    accompanying cut. At Centla, twenty-five or thirty miles north of
    Cordova, a series of remarkable fortifications were discovered in
    1821, which have been most thoroughly described by Sr. Sartorius, who
    visited the locality in 1833, but whose account was not published until
    1869.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

  </div>

  <p>The most notable fortification is situated at a narrow pass between
    two ravines, with perpendicular walls several hundred feet deep. The
    distance between the precipices at this point is only twenty-eight
    feet. The defensive works consist of several pyramidal structures built
    of stone and mortar. The largest of these has three terraces rising
    from the rear until they approach a perpendicular wall, fronting a
    narrow passage-way only three feet wide. This perpendicular wall is
    surmounted with parapets and loop-holes for defence. A pyramid on the
    opposite side of the passage-way, the platform of which is reached by
    a single flight of steps, is possessed of the same defensive features,
    with the addition of a ditch at its front eleven feet wide excavated
    in the solid rock to a depth of five and a half feet. The object <span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>of
    the fortress seems to have been the protection of an oval-shaped tract
    of fertile land containing about four hundred acres, lying between
    the barrancas. At the opposite end of the oval tract, the precipices
    approach so closely to each other as to leave a narrow passage of only
    three feet in width, which also is guarded by stone walls. Of numerous
    pyramids in the region, the one figured in the cut (from Bancroft’s
    work) is pronounced by Sr. Sartorius as typical of all of them.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

  <p>Half a league below the town of Huatusco, Dupaix discovered a
    remarkable pyramid crowning a hill on a slope of which was also a group
    of ruins called the Pueblo Viejo. This structure known as El Castillo,
    measures sixty-six feet in height, though there is some uncertainty
    as to the size of the base.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Dupaix’s text states it to be two
    hundred and twenty-one feet square, but Mr. Bancroft calls attention
    to the fact that Castañeda’s drawing makes it about seventy-five feet
    square. The pyramid in three terraces measures thirty-seven feet
    high. The superstructure is in three stories, with a single doorway
    in the lowest. This seems to have been the only opening through the
    walls of the castle, which were eight feet thick; we presume, however,
    only at their base, as their exterior shows a sloping rather than a
    perpendicular surface. The lowest story forms a single apartment with
    three pillars in the centre supporting the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>beams of the floor above.
    Portions of the beams were visible when Dupaix visited the locality.
    The walls of the castle are of rubble made of stone and mortar, as
    in the Yucatan structures, having stone facings. The exterior of the
    castle proper was coated with polished plaster and ornamented with
    panels containing regular rows of round stones embedded in the coating.
    Some unimportant fragments of sculpture in stone and terra-cotta were
    found in the ruin. El Castillo is of special interest because of the
    well-preserved condition of its superstructure. About one hundred and
    fifty or sixty miles north-west of the city of Vera Cruz, the German
    artist Nebel found a group of ruins known as those of <i>Tusapan</i>,
    buried in a dense forest at the foot of the Cordillera. The only
    structure which remains standing closely resembles the pyramid above
    described, except that the walls of the pyramid are not terraced, and
    the tower surmounting the pyramid is built with a single story. The
    only opening in the tower is the doorway at the head of the stairway.
    The interior contains a single apartment twelve feet square. The
    ceiling is said to have been arched or pointed, but Herr Nebel has
    failed to furnish definite information as to whether the arch was of
    overlapping stones or not, an oversight of an unpardonable character,
    since it would be of greatest interest to know whether the Maya arch
    existed so far north. The pyramid is described as thirty feet square,
    and built of irregular blocks of limestone, which was probably covered
    with a coat of the plastering generally employed and so polished in
    its appearance.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> One remaining structure in the State of Vera
    Cruz merits special attention, namely, the pyramid of Papantla. This
    pyramid, known as El Tajin, “the thunderbolt,” is situated in a dense
    forest near the modern town of Papantla, which lies about forty miles
    east of Tusapan. There is a wide divergence of expression as to
    the dimensions of the pyramid. Herr Nebel, however, makes the base
    something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span> over ninety feet square and the height fifty-four feet. The
    pyramid is seven stories high and apparently solid, except the topmost
    story which contained interior departments. This crowning structure is
    now sadly dilapidated. Dupaix’s statement, copied by Humboldt, that the
    material of the pyramid is porphyry, cut in immense blocks, appears to
    be an error, since later exploration has revealed the fact that the
    pyramid was constructed of regularly cut blocks of sandstone laid in
    mortar, and coated with a hard, smooth cement, three inches thick. A
    stairway on the eastern front is divided as well as being guarded by
    solid stone balustrades.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

  <p>For Nahua monuments of the purest type we naturally turn to Anahuac
    the home of Toltec and Aztec art during its most advanced period of
    development. But alas! the hand of the conqueror and the zeal of the
    fanatic have robbed irretrievably the antiquarian and the student
    of the history of architecture and art, of the best and noblest
    remains of that strangely interesting civilization. Our attention
    is naturally directed to the architecture of that ancient religious
    centre—Cholula—the origin of which, together with that of its great
    pyramid, we have described in a previous chapter. We have already
    seen that the prime object for erecting the immense pile, according
    to Duran, was the worship of the sun, and not to afford a refuge from
    a deluge as has been generally supposed. The pyramid of Cholula is
    situated in the eastern portion of a village to which it has given its
    name, and is reached by a ride of about ten miles westward from the
    city of Puebla de los Angelos. The magnificent temple upon its summit
    dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, fell a prey to the destroying vengeance
    of Cortez, who no doubt was enraged at the stubborn resistance <span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>with
    which he was met by the devoted natives, in a hard-fought battle at
    the foot and upon the slopes of the pyramid. Of the large number of
    descriptions, either made from personal observation or written from a
    comparison of accounts, none surpass that of Humboldt, which was the
    result of a careful survey, performed in 1803. Humboldt’s drawing,
    however, was a restoration and not a picture of the condition of
    the shrub-grown hill as he saw it.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> The pyramid, according to
    Humboldt, measures at the base six hundred and thirty-nine metres or
    a trifle more than fourteen hundred and twenty-eight feet square; in
    other words, about forty-four acres. The base is shown by Humboldt to
    be more than twice as large as that of Cheops. Humboldt and Dupaix
    give its height as fifty-four metres or one hundred and seventy-seven
    feet; Mayer says it is two hundred and four feet; Tylor, two hundred
    and five feet, and Heller<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> states that its summit platform covers
    an area of 13,285 square feet. Its height is somewhat greater than
    that of the pyramid of Mycerinus. Humboldt compares it to a mass of
    brick, covering a square four times as large as the Place Vendôme and
    twice the height of the Louvre. He considers it of the same type as
    the temple of Jupiter Bélus—the pyramids of Meïdoùn Dahchoùr, and the
    group of Sakharah in Egypt. This great monument was constructed in four
    equal terraces of small sun-dried bricks, laid in a mortar which has
    been pronounced by some a mixture of clay with fragments of stones and
    pottery, by others a cement intermixed with small pieces of porphyry
    and limestone. Herr Heller discovered that the entire structure had
    been covered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>with a coating of cement composed of lime, sand and
    mortar.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> The present appearance of the pyramid is sufficient to
    induce the opinion that it was originally a natural eminence faced up
    with adobes in terraces, in accordance with the architectural idea, but
    its position in the centre of a plain, together with the revelations
    as to its contents, disclosed by the construction of the Pueblo road
    through one corner of its base, furnish partial if not conclusive
    proof that it was entirely of artificial construction. The excavation
    revealed the perfect regularity with which the bricks were laid in
    the interior, and brought to light a tomb containing two skeletons,
    two basalt figures, a collection of pottery and other articles not
    described. Humboldt has fully described this chamber, which was
    constructed with stone walls supported by cypress timbers. No doorway
    could be found opening into the tomb.</p>

  <p>At Xochicalco, the “hill” or “castle of flowers,” situated seventy-five
    miles south-west from the city of Mexico and distant from Cuernavaca
    fifteen miles in nearly the same direction, are found the most
    remarkable specimens of ancient Mexican architecture north of the
    isthmus of Tehuantepec. The most important descriptions of the ruins
    are by Alzate y Ramirez,<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Humboldt,<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> Dupaix and Castañeda,<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
    Nebel,<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> and one prepared by the authority of the Mexican
    government.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span></p>

  <p>These ruins are both beneath and upon a natural hill of oval form
    measuring about two miles in circumference and from three hundred to
    four hundred feet in height, authorities differing considerably on
    this point. At the foot of the hill on its northern side, are the
    entrances of two tunnels, one of which extends to a point eighty-two
    feet from the edge of the hill, where it terminates abruptly. The
    second tunnel penetrates the solid limestone of the hill in the form
    of a square gallery nine and a half feet high and broad, extending
    inward for several hundred feet and branching into several auxiliary
    galleries, which terminate in some instances abruptly. The floors are
    paved with small blocks of stone, to a thickness of a foot and a half;
    masonry in some places support the sides, and all the interior surface
    shows traces of red paint upon the polished cement coating with which
    it was finished. The principal gallery, after turning a right angle
    toward the left and extending some hundred feet in a straight line,
    enlarges into a subterranean chamber eighty feet long by about sixty
    feet in width. Two circular columns of living rock were left in making
    the excavation as supports for the roof. The most singular feature
    connected with the chamber is the perfectly circular excavation found
    at its south-east angle, or that corner of the room diagonally opposite
    to the corner at which the passage-way enters it. This circular
    apartment is only about six feet in diameter, and while it is no deeper
    than the adjoining chamber, rises above its ceiling in a dome-shaped
    roof, lined with stones hewn in curved blocks. The curve of this
    dome-like ceiling corresponds with that of a well-proportioned Gothic
    arch. At the apex of the dome, a round hole ten inches in diameter
    extends vertically upwards; some suppose to the pyramid above, but a
    moment’s calculation suffices to show that in view of the considerable
    diameter of the hill and the comparatively short distance from the
    chamber to its exterior slope, such is impossible. The exterior of the
    hill presents a most wonderful display of masonry. Its entire circuit
    is compassed with five terraces of well-laid stone and mortar, faced
    with perpendicular walls. Each terrace of masonry is about seventy
    feet in height, and is constructed in an irregular line,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span> forming
    sharp angles, like the bastions of a fortress; each wall supporting
    the terraces rises above the level of their respective platforms in
    parapets, evidently for defence. The pavements of the platforms are
    of stone and inclined slightly toward the south-west, with a view to
    draining off the rainfall. Dupaix is the only explorer who mentions
    the means of ascent, which he describes as a roadway eight feet wide,
    leading to the summit. The summit platform measures 285 by 328 feet,
    and is surrounded by a wall which is perpendicular on the inside, and
    on the outside conforms to the slope of the terrace wall of which it
    is an extension. This parapet, built of stones without mortar, rises
    five and a half feet above the plaza, and is two feet and nine inches
    thick, we presume at its top, since the outer slope of the terrace
    would make a difference between the top and bottom. Near the centre of
    the plaza stands the base of a pyramid which presents some remarkable
    architectural contrasts from anything we have thus far described. Its
    sides face the cardinal points,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span> and measure sixty-five feet from east
    to west, and fifty-eight feet from north to south. One of the façades,
    the northern, according to Nebel, and the western, according to the
    Mexican Government Survey in the <cite>Revista</cite>, is cut in two in the
    centre by an opening twenty feet wide, where it is supposed a stairway
    formerly led to the superstructure. The cut from Nebel, and reproduced
    by Mr. Bancroft, shows the façade to the left of the opening, as the
    observer faces the pyramid.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The great granite or porphyritic stones which constitute the facing
    of the pyramid, some of them eleven feet in length and three feet in
    height, must have been brought to the summit of the hill at the expense
    of great labor, especially since they must have been transported from a
    considerable distance, no such material being found within a circuit of
    many leagues. The stones were laid without mortar, and so nicely that
    it is said the joints are scarcely perceptible. Fragments of a ruined
    superstructure surmount the pyramid. The foundation walls of the second
    story were two feet and three inches from the edge of the cornice below
    it, except on the west where the space was four and a half feet wide.
    In 1755, so say the inhabitants of the vicinity, the structure was yet
    complete, having five receding stories like the first, and probably
    reaching a height of sixty-five feet. On its crowning summit, on the
    eastern side, stood a large throne-like block of stone, ornamented
    with elaborate sculptures. The second story foundations indicate the
    position of three doorways at the head of the grand stairway, and the
    account in the <cite>Revista</cite> describes an apartment twenty-two feet
    square observable at the summit of the first story, but now filled with
    fragments of stone. Mr. Bancroft suggests that from this apartment
    there may have been some means of communication with the subterranean
    galleries already described. The colossal sculpture on the face of the
    pyramid will receive our attention on a future page.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span></p>

  <p>The general description given above, together with the reported
    character of the superstructure of this magnificent monument, calls to
    mind the main features of the great teocalli dedicated to the bloody
    god Huitzilopochtli in the Aztec capital called Tenochtitlan or Mexico.
    This blood-stained temple upon whose altars smoked the hearts of
    countless human victims, is supposed to have occupied the site of the
    cathedral fronting the Plaza Mayor of the modern city of Mexico. Not a
    vestige of that terraced pyramid has survived the destructive hand of
    fanaticism and the transforming work of man and nature which have been
    going on ever since upon the old site of the capital of the Montezumas.
    It is said to have been built in five stories, with flights of steps
    affording access to the summit; but each flight was so constructed with
    reference to the platform at its top, as to require almost a complete
    circuit of the building before the next flight could be reached. It was
    necessary, therefore, in order to reach the summit platform, to pass
    four times around the pyramid. It is supposed that this was intended
    to display to better advantage the solemn processions of the priests
    as their long train mounted gradually the sides of the edifice. The
    specialist is already familiar with the descriptions by Bernal Diaz,
    whose particular extravagance of statement renders his work altogether
    unreliable. Also with the accounts by Torquemada, Gomera, Cortez and
    Clavigero. The reader has no doubt acquainted himself with the main
    facts in the writings of the graceful and imaginative Prescott, whose
    seeming romance, <cite>The History of the Conquest of Mexico</cite>, has been
    proven by recent and reliable investigation to have approached much
    nearer to fact than to fiction. Mr. Tylor, after careful exploration,
    has expressed in his “Anahuac” his surprise and satisfaction at what
    he considers to be the proof of Mr. Prescott’s general correctness
    of statement as to the extent of the Aztec capital and the probable
    character of its edifices.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

  <p>For a description of the palaces of Mexico and Chapultepec, the
    museums, mansions of the nobles, the pavements and aqueducts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span> of that
    buried city, we refer the reader who has not access to the sources, to
    the admirable account by Prescott, especially since it more properly
    belongs to the province of history (now that all traces of them have
    disappeared) than to that of archæology.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

  <p>Of many interesting localities where architectural remains still
    exist, we select one more in the Central region, to illustrate our
    subject. The ancient religious city of the early Nahuas, Teotihuacan,
    with its famous pyramids—the traditional origin of which we have
    already noted<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>—deserves our attention. The city of the gods has
    had many describers, from the illustrious Humboldt to the observant
    and philosophical Mr. Tylor. The most complete description, however,
    is that given in the report of a scientific commission appointed
    by the Mexican government in 1864, containing accurate plans and
    views.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> Sr. Antonio Garcia y Cubas, a member of the commission,
    subsequently published a most interesting memoir on the pyramids of
    Teotihuacan, entitled <cite>Ensayo de un Estudio comparativo entre las
    Pirámides Egípcias y Mexicanas</cite> (Mexico, 1871). The analogies
    between Teotihuacan and Egyptian pyramids receive the greater share of
    attention, though some valuable facts not mentioned in the report of
    the commission are here made known. Mr. Bancroft has reproduced the
    main features of the report of the Mexican Commission and compared it
    with previous researches, thus presenting the reader with probably the
    best critical version of the exploration of Teotihuacan, to be found
    in any language.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> The cut reduced from Almaraz for Mr. Bancroft’s
    work shows the plan of the Teotihuacan monuments on a scale of about
    twenty-five hundred and fifty feet to an inch.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Plan of Teotihuacan.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The pyramid marked A in the plan is known as Metztli Itzacual, which
    is interpreted “House of the Moon.” It measures 156 metres or 512
    feet from east to west by 130 metres or 426 feet from north to south.
    According to Almarez, its height is 42 metres or 137 feet, but Sr.
    Garcia y Cubas, who took his measurement on the opposite side of the
    pyramid from that measured by Almaraz, says that it is 46 metres or
    150 feet high. The summit platform, according to Garcia y Cubas, is
    six metres or nineteen and a half feet square; quite a discrepancy
    is here observable between the estimated area given by Beaufoy and
    copied by Mr. Bancroft as thirty-six by sixty feet, and this actual
    measurement. The sides of the pyramid nearly face the cardinal points.
    The eastern slope is 31° 30′, while the southern is somewhat steeper,
    being 36°. The slope on the east seems to have been unbroken except
    by a zigzag roadway, leading to the summit. The remaining sides
    are plainly marked by the remains of three terraces, one of which
    is still about three feet wide. Humboldt and Tylor both speak of
    remains of stairways of which no mention is made by the Government
    Commission. Most observers have described the pyramids as faced with
    hewn stone, but the commissioners on the contrary found them coated
    with successive layers of different conglomerates as follows: “1st,
    small stones from eight to twelve inches in diameter, with mud forming
    a layer of about thirty-two inches; 2d, fragments of volcanic tufa,
    as large as a man’s fist, also in mud, to the thickness of sixteen
    inches; 3d, small grains of tetzontli (a porous volcanic rock) of
    the size of peas, with mud, twenty-eight inches thick; 4th, a very
    thin and smooth coat of pure lime mortar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span> These layers are repeated
    in the same order nine times and are parallel to the slopes of the
    pyramid, which would make the thickness of the superficial facing
    about sixty feet.”<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> On the southern slope, sixty-nine feet from
    the base, according to Almarez, a gallery large enough to admit a
    man crawling on hands and knees, extends inward on an incline, a
    distance of twenty-five feet, and terminates in two square wells or
    chambers, each five feet square, and one of them fifteen feet deep.
    Mr. Löwenstern, according to Mr. Bancroft, states that “the gallery
    is a hundred and fifty-seven feet long, increasing in height to over
    six feet and a half, as it penetrates the pyramid; that the well is
    over six feet square, extending apparently down to the base and up to
    the summit; and that other cross galleries are blocked up by débris!”
    It is probable that these remarkable galleries never existed, except
    in Mr. Löwenstern’s imagination, since Sr. Almarez in the report of
    the official survey pronounces the tunnel already described as simply
    excavations by treasure-hunters. The pyramid B of the plan, situated
    five hundred and seventy-five yards south of the House of the Moon, is
    called Tonatiuh Itzacual, or “House of the Sun.” This pyramid requires
    no description, except to give its dimensions, since in all other
    respects it is precisely similar <span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>to the House of the Moon. The House
    of the Sun, according to the measurement of Sr. Garcia y Cubas, which
    is the most recent, is at the base 232 metres or 761 feet by 220 metres
    or 722 feet. Its height is 66 metres or 216 feet, while the summit
    platform measures 18 by 32 metres or 59 by 105 feet. Both this pyramid
    and the preceding have each a small mound on one of their sides near
    their base. In the latter instance this mound seems connected with
    an avenue of mounds just west of it. An embankment marked <i>a</i>,
    <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, one hundred and thirty feet wide on the
    summit and twenty feet high, widening out at the extremities into
    platforms, extends around three sides of the “House of the Sun.” Across
    the Rio San Juan, and at the distance of twelve hundred and fifty yards
    southward of the “House of the Sun,” stands the Texcalpa or “citadel.”
    This is a quadrangular enclosure, measuring on its exterior twelve
    hundred and forty-six by thirteen hundred and thirty-eight feet. The
    embankments are of enormous strength, being two hundred and sixty-two
    feet thick by thirty-three feet high, except on the western side,
    which is but sixteen feet high. The enclosure is divided unequally by
    a wall as strong as that upon the sides. On the centre of this wall
    stands a pyramid ninety-two feet high. At its base are two small mounds
    besides one in the western enclosure, while fourteen others averaging
    twenty feet in height are arranged with regularity upon the summit of
    the enclosing wall. An avenue two hundred and fifty feet wide formed
    by mounds and measuring two hundred and fifty rods in length, extends
    from a point south of the “House of the Moon” to the river, as is shown
    from C to D, in the plan. The avenue is cut up into compartments by six
    cross embankments, a rather strange feature for which no explanation
    has been afforded. These mounds are mostly conical, built of fragments
    of stone and clay, and some of them reach a height of thirty feet. The
    native traditions call it Micaotli, which may indicate that they were
    designed for the purposes of sepulture. Almaraz, who excavated one of
    the multitude of mounds or <i>tlalteles</i> in the vicinity, found four
    walls meeting at right angles, though a little inclined and forming
    a small square. Connected with this were steps, at the top of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span> which
    four other walls enclosed a little room, supposed to have been a tomb.
    The natives describe the discovery of a stone box in one of the mounds
    containing a skull, with about such a collection of trinkets as is
    commonly met with in the stone graves of Tennessee. Mayer describes a
    massive stone column, ten feet long and four feet square, cut from a
    single block. This resembles the elaborate capitol of a column resting
    on a base with scarcely a shaft intervening. It is called the fainting
    stone by the natives, who believe that whoever sits on it is sure to
    faint instantly.</p>

  <p>One additional group of ruins, as yet unclassified with any of the
    types we have described, merits our attention. This group is known
    as Los Edificios of Quemada, situated in southern Zacatecas north of
    the Central plateau and probably the home of the Chichimecs.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Mr.
    Bancroft has attempted to reconstruct the unsatisfactory accounts of
    the several explorers of Quemada, but with little success. We therefore
    decline adding another comparative failure to the list of literature
    on these ruins. Some general observations, however, may not be out of
    place. The Cerro de los Edificios is a natural eminence about half a
    mile long and between one hundred and two hundred yards wide, except at
    its southern extremity where it increases to a width of five hundred
    yards. The authorities differ as to its height, one saying from two
    to three hundred feet, and another eight to nine hundred feet above
    the plain. Ancient roads well paved radiate in various directions from
    the hill, some of them <span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>extending a distance of five or six miles. The
    northern brow of the hill, where the descent is not so precipitous
    as at the other points, is guarded by a stone wall, as are all other
    points where the precipitous sides do not offer a sufficient barrier
    to an intruder from without. The surface of the hill is quite uneven,
    and these irregularities have been formed into terraces supported by
    stone walls. Foundations have thus been secured for a multitude of
    structures, some of them perfectly pyramidal and others consisting
    of quadrangular enclosures or squares, terraced and having steps
    descending to the court within, where pyramidal structures of stone are
    found. On the eastern terrace of the Cerro, a round pillar, eighteen
    feet high and nineteen feet in circumference, stands in proximity to a
    wall of as great height as the pillar. Traces of nine similar pillars
    are visible, and the probability is that they formed part of a balcony
    or perhaps a portico. Adjoining this wall is an enclosure measuring 138
    by 100 feet, in which are eleven pillars in line, each seventeen feet
    in circumference and as high as an adjacent wall, namely eighteen feet.
    The distance from the wall is twenty-three feet, and the presumption is
    that the pillars supported a roof. There are no doorways, properly so
    called, since the doorways are large quadrangular openings extending to
    the full height of the halls. No windows were discovered anywhere. The
    material is gray porphyry from hills across an intervening valley, and
    the mortar is reddish clay, mixed with straw, and is of poor quality.
    Sculpture, hieroglyphics, pottery, human remains, idols, arrow-heads,
    and obsidian fragments are totally wanting, thus presenting a strange
    contrast with all other Mexican ruins. Nevertheless, the massiveness
    of the fortifications, the height and great thickness of the walls,
    none of which are less than eight feet thick and in one instance over
    twenty, the extensive system of paved roads, besides great elevated
    stone causeways running through the city, the size of the enclosed
    squares, one of which contains six acres, all indicate that this
    might have been the capital city of a powerful people, a people whose
    architectural affinities with all others that we are acquainted with
    are very few, and whose contrasts are numerous. Certainly the type and
    execution of the masonry, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span> massive, is more primitive than found
    elsewhere in Mexico. We do not mean that it is more ancient, for such
    cannot be true, but inferior to that in other parts of Mexico and the
    Central American region. The arch of overlapping stones is entirely
    wanting, and but for the round columns without either base or capitol,
    the steps toward advancement in the art would only be those common to
    that generally vigorous and warlike period which, in the history of
    every people, has preceded a higher civilization. Mr. Bancroft has
    published Burghes’ plan of Quemada but to little purpose, since the
    descriptive matter available does not contain a reference to more than
    one-fourth of the many structures indicated.</p>

  <p>In the course of the chapter, we have indicated the principal
    resemblances and contrasts between the various styles treated. The
    pyramidal structure we have found employed by both Mayas and Nahuas,
    with certain modifications and with such resemblances as would seem to
    indicate that both peoples had been originally, or at an early day,
    near neighbors, and that the younger people, at least the more recent
    in their occupancy of Mexico and Central America, the Nahuas, may
    have copied the pyramid in its perfected form from the Mayas. We have
    noted some difference between the ancient and modern Maya styles. In
    the ancient or Chiapan, the irregularities in the face of the pyramid
    caused by constructing it of tiers of rectangular stones were filled
    with mortar, and an even surface produced. In the modern or Yucatec
    style the blocks of stone-facing are bevelled to the angle of the
    slope. Furthermore, in some instances the corners of the pyramids
    were rounded. At Palenque the superstructures were of only one story,
    while Yucatec structures were often formed of three receding stories.
    Of the Copan ruins little can be said intelligently, except that the
    pyramid combined with the terrace is all-pervading, but still is not
    unlike the Palenque style in its main features. The Nahua architecture
    offers a great variety of styles, but at the same time the pyramidal
    structure is the fundamental feature of all kinds of structures. Mitla
    offers an exception to this rule, but there are doubts as to whether
    Mitla may be classified as a Nahua<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span> ruin at all. The early writers
    devoted much of their attention to seeming old world resemblances in
    ancient American architecture, but their speculations in most cases
    were puerile and trivial. Mr. Stephens, with the experience which
    the careful study and observation of old world monuments afforded
    him, strongly denies that any such analogies are to be found among
    the Maya groups.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> M. Viollet-le-Duc considers the monuments of
    Mexico, especially those of Maya origin, to have been influenced by
    white and yellow races, the former of the Aryan from the north-east,
    the latter the Turanian from the north-west. He seems to find some
    analogy between ancient Japanese temples (and quotes a description
    from Charlevoix, <cite>Histoire du Japan</cite>, ed. 1754, tom. i, chap.
    x, p. 171) and those of ancient America. He thinks that the style of
    architecture at Uxmal indicates clearly that the first structures
    were of wood and resembled the style prevalent in Japan. However, the
    wooden structures more properly originated with the white races, while
    the use of stucco is characteristic of the Turanian or Yellow races
    of the north-west. He thinks it certain that Mitla and Palenque were
    influenced by a white race.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> Señor Garcia y Cubas has attempted
    to prove in a careful argument that the pyramids of Teotihuacan were
    built for the same purposes as were the pyramids of Egypt. He considers
    the analogy established in eleven particulars, as follows: the site
    chosen is the same; the structures are oriented with slight variation,
    the line through the centres of the pyramids is in the astronomical
    meridian; the construction in grades and steps is the same; in both
    cases the larger pyramids are dedicated to the sun; the Nile has a
    “valley of the dead,” as in Teotihuacan there is a “street of the
    dead;” some monuments of each class have the nature of fortifications;
    the smaller mounds are of the same nature and for the same purpose;
    both pyramids have a small mound joined to one of their faces; the
    openings discovered in the Pyramid of the Moon are also found in
    some Egyptian pyramids; the interior arrangement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span> of the pyramids is
    analogous.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Mr. Delafield by a less systematic argument advocates
    the same theory. However, his capability to discern analogies is not
    confined to a single structure, since in the pyramid of Cholula and
    the teocalli of the city of Mexico he finds a counterpart to the
    temple of Belus at Babylon, as described by Herodotus. The walls
    around the hill at Xochicalco explain the use of similar embankments
    at Circleville and Marietta in Ohio, while the order of the apartments
    at Mitla bears a striking analogy to the arrangements of apartments
    in the temples of upper Egypt. This and much more Mr. Delafield has
    been able to discover, but unfortunately only with certainty to
    his own mind.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> Löwenstern is equally certain that the American
    monuments were not constructed by a nation analogous to that which
    built the pyramids of Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> Ranking, on the other hand, finds
    that Teotihuacan was named after the illustrious dead buried beneath
    its pyramids, as was the custom in Egypt, but in this instance the
    name is analogous to that of Thiautcan or Khan, the name of the grand
    Khan of the Monguls and Tartars who occupied the throne of China at
    the time of Sir John Mandeville’s visit to Pekin in the fourteenth
    century; and as at Teotihuacan and among the Monguls the sun and moon
    were worshipped, so, according to Ranking, those American monuments
    are attributable to Mongul architects.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> It would be easy for us to
    continue the citation of these fancied analogies, but it is no doubt
    already apparent to the reader that they are generally of too trivial a
    character to serve the ends of science, and we therefore dismiss their
    further consideration.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

  <p><i>Sculpture and Hieroglyphics.</i>—The mound sculpture, as has been
    observed in the cuts illustrating a previous chapter of this work,
    though comparatively rude in most cases, still, in a few instances,
    is quite remarkable as affording true representations of animals
    and possibly of the human face. Considerable progress in the art of
    ornamentation in terra-cotta is displayed on many of the vases and
    burial urns exhumed from the mounds. Many of the lines, figures and
    borders traced in relief and sometimes in taglio on those vessels
    indicate not only that a sense of the beautiful was present, but that
    it had been cultivated to a considerable extent. The same remarks apply
    to the pottery of the Pueblos and Cliff-dwellers. At Palenque, however,
    the student of art meets with no mean attempts at delineating the
    human form—in fact, the success obtained in this difficult field alone
    characterized the work of the Palenque artists. It is presumed that
    nearly all of the piers separating the doorways in the eastern wall of
    the palace were ornamented with stucco bas-reliefs. Two out of six of
    the best preserved are shown in the following cuts. The most remarkable
    feature of the first (Fig. 1, reduced from Waldeck for Bancroft’s
    work) is the cranial type, deformed to a shocking degree, probably by
    artificial pressure, so generally employed by the ancient American
    races. Possibly it is but a caricature.</p>

      Fig. 2.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Fig. 2 (a photographic reduction from Waldeck) presents us with a
    subject which has called forth no little discussion. The “elephant’s
    trunk” which protrudes from the elaborate head-dress of the priest has
    been thought to indicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span> an Asiatic influence.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> We have already
    referred to the frequent occurrence of the “elephant trunk” ornament in
    Yucatan. The hieroglyphic signs at the top and on the faces of these
    reliefs no doubt hold locked up in their mysterious symbols the history
    of the scene.</p>

  <p>In all of these reliefs the flattened cranial type is present, and
    no doubt represents the ideal of beauty among those ancient people.
    The stuccoes appear to have been moulded upon the undercoating of
    cement after it had become hard. The brush of the painter was then
    employed in its final embellishment.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> Adjacent to the eastern
    stairway leading downward into the main court of the palace are great
    stone slabs, forming a surface on each side of the steps fifty feet
    long by eleven feet high. Waldeck, Stephens and Bancroft furnish
    views of gigantic human figures sculptured in low relief upon these
    surfaces. Both the attitudes and expressions portrayed indicate that
    the groups represented are either captives or possibly victims for
    sacrifice.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> On the opposite side of the court, and on the stone
    face of the balustrade of a stairway, two figures, male and female, are
    sculptured, which, according to Waldeck, are of the Caucasian type. The
    same artist has shown the beautiful grecques which adorn the panels of
    the cornice.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Waldeck and Bancroft have figured a remarkable stone
    tablet of elliptical form, in which a princely personage is represented
    as sitting cross-legged on a chair formed of a double-headed animal,
    pronounced by Stephens to resemble a leopard. Catherword’s plate, in
    Morelet’s <cite>Travels</cite>, shows an ornament suspended from the neck of
    the chief figure resembling an effigy of the sun, while in Waldeck’s
    drawing the Egyptian <span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>Tau is graven upon the ornament.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> The
    accompanying cut shows Waldeck’s drawing (employed by Mr. Bancroft).</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Sculptured Tablet in the Palace.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Four hundred yards south of the palace stands the ruins of a pyramid
    and temple, which, at the time of Dupaix’s and of Waldeck’s visits
    were in a good state of preservation, but quite dilapidated when seen
    by Charnay. The temple faces the east, and on the western wall of its
    inner apartment, itself facing the eastern light, is found (or rather
    was, for it has now entirely disappeared) the most beautiful specimen
    of stucco relief in America. M. Waldeck, with the critical insight
    of an experienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span> artist, declares it “worthy to be compared to the
    most beautiful works of the age of Augustus.” He therefore named the
    temple the Beau Relief. The above cut is a reduction from Waldeck’s
    drawing used in Mr. Bancroft’s work, and is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span> accurate. However,
    the peculiar beauty of Waldeck’s drawing is such that it must be seen
    in order to be fully appreciated.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely necessary for us to call the reader’s attention to the
    details of this picture, in which correctness of design and graceful
    outlines predominate to such an extent that we may safely pronounce
    the beautiful youth who sits enthroned on his elaborate and artistic
    throne, the American Apollo. In the original drawing the grace of the
    arms and wrists is truly matchless, and the chest muscles are displayed
    in the most perfect manner. The embroidered girdle and folded drapery
    of the figure, as well as the drapery around the leopards’ necks, are
    arranged with taste. The head-dress is not unlike a Roman helmet in
    form, with the addition of numerous plumes. The sandals of the feet are
    secured by a cord and rosette, while ornaments on the animals’ ankles
    seem secured by leather straps. The engraving does not do justice to
    the face-like ornament suspended by the string of pearls upon the
    youth’s breast. In the original drawing it is quite beautiful, and of a
    female cast.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

  <p>The next subject of interest to the student of sculpture is found in
    the Temple of the Cross, in the inmost sanctuary of all, and is known
    as the Tablet of the Cross. Three stones cover most of the surface of
    the rear wall of the sanctum sanctorum, and present an area six feet
    four inches high by ten feet eight inches wide. The central of the
    three stones bears the celebrated sculpture of the cross which has
    excited so much interest and comment, to say nothing of speculation
    as to its origin. The cut is a photographic reduction from Waldeck’s
    drawing. A priest and priestess appear to be offering an infant to an
    ugly bird which stands perched upon the cross. The infant’s face is
    completely hid by a fantastic mask or cap. The expression of pain on
    the faces of the officiating personages is very marked. The symmetry
    of proportion employed in the sculpture is conceded by all observers.
    The two lateral stones (the left-hand one being shown in our cut) are
    covered with hieroglyphics, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>which begin at the left-hand upper corner
    with a large capital letter. Some one had removed the central stone
    from its position prior to Waldeck’s visit, and conveyed it to a point
    in the forest not far distant. Stephens also found it in the same
    locality. By referring to the hieroglyphic tablet at the left of the
    cross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span> it will be observed that just below the large initial letter or
    word is a threefold hieroglyphic, while seven others in the same column
    are double. This would indicate, we should think, that the characters
    were read from the top downwards, though it is possible that the lines
    were read horizontally, each line beginning with a capital as in
    poetry.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Palenque Statue.</div>
  </div>

  <p>On either side of the doorway opening to the inner sanctuary of the
    Cross, were originally two male figures sculptured in low-relief on
    stone; one of them, which appears to represent an aged royal person,
    is beautifully clad in a leopard’s skin, while the opposite figure,
    designed probably to represent youthful manhood, is arrayed in what
    may be an elaborate military dress and plumed crest of magnificent
    character. He wears what appears to be a cuirass about his shoulders
    and chest. These tablets were removed to the village of Santo Domingo
    years ago and set up in a modern house, where they were offered to
    M. Waldeck on the sole condition that he should marry one of the
    proprietresses, though he at the time was more than sixty-four years of
    age. Stephens could have obtained them by purchasing the house in which
    they had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>been placed, but did not.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> On the slope of the pyramid of
    the Cross, M. Waldeck found two statues just alike, one of which was
    unfortunately broken; the other, subsequently sketched by Catherwood,
    is shown in the cut, a photographic reduction from Waldeck. These
    statues were ten and a half feet high, though two and a half feet of
    their length, not shown in the cut, formed a tenon by which they were
    embedded in the floor of the pyramidal surface, where Waldeck supposes
    they stood supporting a platform about twenty feet square, in front of
    the central doorway. These are the only statues ever found at Palenque;
    but it is doubted whether they can be technically called statues, since
    the back is of rough stone, and unsculptured. They probably rested
    against a wall and served as supports for an upper roof or floor, as
    indicated by Waldeck. The head-dress has been pronounced Egyptian by
    all who have seen it.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

  <p>In the temple of the Sun, in a position precisely corresponding to
    that occupied by the tablet of the cross, stands a somewhat similar
    tablet cut in low-relief on three slabs covering an area of eight by
    nine feet. The figure of the cross in this instance is displaced by
    a hideous face or mask supposed to represent the sun, supported by a
    framework resting on the shoulders of crouching men. The priest and
    priestess occupy the same positions as occupied by them in the tablet
    of the cross. Each is in the act of presenting a child with masked face
    to the sun, and each is standing upon the back of a kneeling slave.
    The lateral tablets are covered with columns or rows of hieroglyphics,
    as in the tablet of the cross.<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> The stuccoed roofs and piers of
    both the temples—Cross and Sun—may be truly pronounced works of art
    of a high order. On the former, Stephens observed busts and heads
    approaching the Greek models in symmetry of contour and perfectness
    of proportion. M. Waldeck has preserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span> in his magnificent drawings
    some of these figures, which are certainly sufficient to prove
    beyond controversy, that the ancient Palenqueans were a cultivated
    and artistic people. In passing to Uxmal the transition is from
    delineations of the human figure to the elegant and superabundant
    exterior ornamentation of edifices, and from stucco to stone as the
    material employed. The human figure, however, when it is represented,
    is in statuary of a high order. The artists of Uxmal did not improve
    upon the Palenque models so much in the design as in the execution
    of their subjects. Uxmal statuary approximates more closely to what
    properly may be called statuary, being cut more nearly “in the round”
    and having less unfinished back surface than the Palenque statue. The
    elegant square panels of grecques and frets which compose the cornice
    of the Casa del Gobernador, delineated in the works of Stephens,
    Baldwin and Bancroft, are a marvel of beauty, which must excite the
    admiration of the most indifferent student of this subject. The
    ornamentation of this great cornice, equal to one-third the height of
    the building, is cut on blocks of stone and inserted in the wall with
    the utmost precision, so that every line matches, and the graceful
    arabesques and bas-reliefs, which sometimes cover several blocks with a
    single figure, are unbroken by apparent joints. The grandest specimens
    of American ornamental sculpture are, however, to be seen on the inner
    fronts of the four buildings of the Casa de Monjas, a plan of which is
    given on <a href="#i_351">page 351</a> of this work. It will be remembered that these fronts
    face the court around which the buildings were constructed. The court
    front of the eastern building is probably one of the most tasteful and
    interesting specimens of sculpture to be met with in America.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> M.
    Waldeck considers that it presents an appearance of grandeur of which
    it would be difficult to give an idea, while Stephens considers its
    chasteness of design a great relief from the gorgeous masses of other
    façades. The cornice over the central doorway and the corners of the
    eastern court <span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>façade are ornamented with ugly masks and “elephant
    trunks” protruding from them, as in the Governor’s home.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> If the
    preceding façade is the most generally admired of those at Uxmal, “the
    most magnificent and beautiful front in America” is that of the Serpent
    Temple, or western court façade of the Nunnery, as is shown in the
    accompanying engraving, which is a photographic reduction of Waldeck’s
    drawing employed in Mr. Bancroft’s work.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The marked feature of the sculpture is the formation of square panels
    by the intertwined bodies of two huge stone serpents with monster
    heads, surmounted by plumes and enclosing between the jaws of each a
    human face. A head and tail as shown above occupy opposite extremes of
    the front. This may be a representation of the plumed serpent of the
    Central American mythology. The stone lattice-work (a feature of Uxmal
    sculpture) underlying the serpents and covering the panels <span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>formed
    by their folds, is more complicated and beautiful than any other in
    America. At regular intervals large grecques or arabesques, with their
    connecting bars lengthened to the width of the entire sculptured
    portion of the façade, are distributed. Several panels are ornamented
    with life-sized human figures, while each panel contains a human
    face, some of which are as beautiful as the Greek models. The upper
    cornice is ornamented, as are all the other cornices of the Nunnery,
    with what are supposed to be Sun symbols, one of which is shown in the
    cut, reduced photographically from Waldeck’s drawing. The appended
    “feathers” are almost Assyrian in their type, while the double triangle
    within the circle is certainly an ancient symbol in the old world.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The “elephant trunks” and rude masks employed as ornaments above
    the doorways of the other fronts, are also numerous here. Since
    M. Waldeck’s visit portions of this wonderful example of ancient
    decorative art have fallen.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> The northern building of the court
    offers no sculptured contrasts with the other buildings, except that
    above the upper cornice, thirteen turrets, each seventeen feet high
    and ten feet wide, are distributed at regular intervals, and are
    also covered with sculpture resembling the grecques of the Serpent
    temple. Most of the sculptures at Uxmal were probably painted, as
    traces of various colors were observed in sheltered localities. The
    rich sculptures of the prophet’s house were painted blue, red, yellow
    and white, according to M. Waldeck. The Mayas no doubt employed the
    brush freely, and in some instances with skill. In the gymnasium at
    Chichen-Itza, Stephens grew enthusiastic <span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>over the exceedingly fine
    series of paintings in bright colors, which cover the walls of one
    of the chambers. Many of the pictures have been destroyed by the
    falling of the plaster upon which they were painted. In this series of
    pictures, battles, processions, houses, trees and a variety of objects
    are represented—blue, red, yellow and green are the colors employed,
    though the human figures are painted reddish brown.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> At Chichen, as
    elsewhere, the favorite subject for the Maya sculpture was the serpent.
    A colossal serpent balustrade is one of the wonders of this interesting
    place.</p>

  <p>Dr. Augustus Le Plongeon, during the last quarter of the year 1875,
    made an extensive exploration of Chichen-Itza. The reports of his
    discoveries seem at first well-nigh fabulous, though their authenticity
    is so well attested as to leave no room for doubt. Mr. Stephen
    Salisbury, Jr., of Worcester, Massachusetts, has in several memoirs
    of intense interest and unusual scientific value, communicated the
    progress and results of Dr. Le Plongeon’s exploration in Yucatan to
    the American Antiquarian Society. Mr. Salisbury has also presented
    the explorer’s original memoirs, accompanied by photographs made at
    Chichen-Itza and on the Islands of Cozumel and Mugeres. These valuable
    documents have reached the public in Mr. Salisbury’s publications
    entitled, (1.) <cite>The Mayas, the Sources of their History</cite>
    (Worcester, 1877, with heliotype reproductions of the photos); (2.)
    <cite>Maya Archæology</cite> (Worcester, 1879, with heliotype reproductions
    of photos and drawings).<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> In these pages we are impressed with
    the fact that the darkness which has so long enveloped the antiquity
    of Yucatan is soon to be displaced by the noon-day of scientific
    investigation. Still we cannot refrain from expressing the regret that
    Dr. Le Plongeon’s enthusiasm is so apparent in his reports. A judicial
    frame of mind, as well as the calmness which accompanies it, are
    requisites both for scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span> work and the inspiration of confidence
    in the reader. Notwithstanding this, our views have been most happily
    expressed by the committee of the American Antiquarian Society, to
    whom was entrusted the publication of Dr. Le Plongeon’s memoirs. Their
    statement is as follows: “The successes of Du Chaillu, Schliemann, and
    of Stanley, are remarkable instances of triumphant results in cases
    where enthusiasm had been supposed to lack the guidance of wisdom.
    If earnest men are willing to take the risks of personal research in
    hazardous regions, or exercise their ingenuity and their scholarship in
    attempting to solve historical or archæological problems, we may accept
    thankfully the information they give, without first demanding in all
    cases unquestionable evidence or absolute demonstration.”</p>

  <p>Dr. Le Plongeon says of the columns at Chichen, “the base is formed by
    the head of Cukulcan, the shaft by the body of the serpent, with its
    feathers beautifully carved to the very chapter. On the chapters of
    the columns that support the portico, at the entrance of the castle
    in Chichen-Itza, may be seen the carved figures of long bearded men,
    with upraised hands, in the act of worshipping sacred trees. They
    forcibly recall to mind the same worship in Assyria.” In consequence
    of the successful interpretation of certain hieroglyphic inscriptions
    at Chichen, the explorer and his wife (who accompanied him in his
    perilous enterprise), learned that the statue of Chaac Mol, or Balam,
    (the tiger king), the greatest of the Itza monarchs, had been buried
    below the surface of the ground at a certain point, distant four
    hundred yards from the palace. The first result of excavation in
    the locality indicated was the discovery of a sculptured tiger of
    colossal size, having a human head, which, unfortunately, was broken
    off. Several slabs bearing sculptures of tigers and birds of prey in
    relief were unearthed. A pedestal supporting the sculptured tiger
    apparently had once occupied the spot, and its destruction had left a
    mound of débris. Seven metres below the surface of this mound a rough
    stone urn containing a little dust was secured, and upon it an earthen
    cover. This was near the head of the statue of Chaac Mol, which was
    next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span> disclosed. The statue is of a white calcareous stone, one metre
    fifty-five centimetres long, one metre fifteen centimetres in height,
    and eighty centimetres wide, and weighed fifty kilos. The statue
    represents the reclining figure of a man, who is naked except that he
    is adorned with a head-dress, with bracelets, garters of feathers,
    and sandals similar to those found upon the mummies of the ancient
    Guanchies of the Canary Islands.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Sculptured Slab found at Chichen-Itza.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The statue of Chaac Mol was seized by Mexican officials and sent to the
    capital. Our friend, the Rev. John W. Butler, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span> the city of Mexico,
    writes to us (letter received October 10, 1878) concerning the statue:
    “It is just as represented. It may be seen in the National Museum,
    just opposite its exact duplicate, which was found under the Plaza of
    the city of Mexico, some years ago. What is the meaning of this? The
    tribe whose king (or god) it was, must have <em>migrated southward</em>,
    for the one excavated in Mexico shows <em>greater age</em> than the one
    from Yucatan.” In reply we would say that the evidences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span> are sufficient
    that the Maya civilization once extended farther north than the city of
    Mexico, but the conquests of the Nahuas drove that ancient people no
    doubt to abandon their northern territory and to confine themselves to
    their lands farther south.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Statue of Chaac Mol.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Dr. Le Plongeon, in speaking of the historical value of the statue,
    says Chaac Mol was one of the three brothers whom tradition declares
    were the co-rulers of Yucatan at a very ancient period. Chaac Mol and
    his beautiful queen Kinich-Kakmó were the powerful sovereigns of the
    kingdom of Chichen-Itza. Aac, one of the brothers, becoming enamored of
    his sister-in-law Kinich-Kakmó, slew Chaac Mol that he might make her
    his wife. The funeral-chamber, the mural paintings, the statues, and
    the monument of the murdered king found by the explorer, were memorials
    of the sad event which the faithful queen caused to be executed by the
    artisans and artists of the royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span> city. Dr. Le Plongeon remarks: “In
    the funeral-chamber, the terrible altercation between Aac and Chaac
    Mol, which had its termination in the murder of the latter by his
    brother, is represented by large figures, three-fourths life size.
    There Aac is painted holding three spears in his hands, typical of the
    three wounds he inflicted on the back of his brother. These wounds are
    indicated on the statue of the dying tiger (symbol of Chaac Mol) by two
    holes near the lumbar region, and one under the left scapula, proving
    that the blow was aimed at the heart from behind. The two wounds are
    also marked by two holes near each other in the lumbar region, on the
    <i>bas-relief</i> of the tiger eating a human heart that adorned the
    Chaac Mol mausoleum (see sculptured slab on <a href="#i_398">page 398</a>).”<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

  <p>Mr. Stephen Salisbury, Jr., in his <cite>Maya Archæology</cite>, has
    reproduced one of Dr. and Mrs. Le Plongeon’s tracings of a mural
    painting in the funeral-chamber of the Chaac Mol monument at
    Chichen-Itza. Through the courtesy of Mr. Salisbury we have been
    permitted to copy it for this work. The Doctor interprets it as
    representing the queen Kinich-Kakmó when a child consulting an
    <em>H-Men</em>, one of the Maya wise men or astrologers, in order to know
    her destiny. The prediction is based upon the lines produced by fire on
    the shell of an armadillo or turtle, and is expressed in the colors of
    the elaborate scroll proceeding from the throat of the <em>H-Men</em>.
    Referring to his tracings of mural paintings at Chichen-Itza, Dr. Le
    Plongeon says “they represent war scenes with javelins flying in all
    directions, warriors fighting, shouting, assuming all sorts of athletic
    positions, scenes from domestic life, marriage ceremonies, temples
    with complete domes, proving that the Itza architects were acquainted
    with the circular arch, but made use of the triangular probably
    because it was the custom and style of architecture of the time and
    country.”<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Besides the sculptures of long-bearded men seen by the
    explorer at Chichen-Itza mentioned on a preceding <span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>page, were tall
    figures of people with small heads, thick lips, and curly short hair or
    wool, regarded as negroes. “We always see them as standard or parasol
    bearers, but never engaged in actual warfare.”<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> He pronounces the
    features of the long-bearded men pictured on the walls of the queen’s
    chambers to be Assyrian in their type. On the Isla Mugeres (in the
    latter part of the year 1876), Dr. Le Plongeon exhumed portions of a
    female figure in terra-cotta, which indicate an advanced state of art
    among the ancient Mayas. The fragments of the statue, consisting of
    the head and feet, were probably attached to the front of a brasero or
    incense-burner used at the shrine of the Maya Venus, located on the
    southern extremity of the island. It was immediately in front of this
    shrine, visited by Cordova in 1516,<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> that the remains of the statue
    were found buried in the sand. The expression of the face is cruel and
    savage, the nostrils are perforated and also the pupils of the eyes.
    The teeth are filed as those of the statue Chaac Mol are said to be.
    The head is surmounted by a head-dress eight inches high. The fragments
    of this statue are now in the possession of Mr. Salisbury.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

    <div class="caption smcap">The Cara Gigantesca.</div>
  </div>

  <p>At Izamel, the burial-place of the culture-hero Zamna, a remarkable
    example of aboriginal sculpture is found upon the side of a mound now
    enclosed in a private court-yard. This specimen of art, known as the
    Cara gigantesca, or gigantic face, measures seven feet in width and
    seven feet eight inches in height. “The features were first rudely
    formed by small rough stones, fixed in the side of the mound by means
    of mortar, and afterwards perfected with a stucco so hard that it has
    successfully resisted for centuries the action of air and water.”
    The accompanying cut from Mr. Bancroft’s work will show the type of
    features.</p>

  <p>The subject of Maya sculpture is almost a limitless one, but we trust
    that the above-cited examples may give the reader a comprehensive
    acquaintance with the existing types. The sculpture of Copan is no
    less remarkable than its architecture. In fact, every object bore the
    skillful marks of the graver’s chisel. The great number of sculptured
    obelisks, pillars and idols have been the wonder of every reader of Mr.
    Stephens’ description. Since his work is so generally known, we refrain
    from presenting more than one example of Copan art. In the accompanying
    cut employed in Mr. Bancroft’s work the elaborateness of the sculpture
    will be observed, and may well be pronounced a marvel of aboriginal art.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Copan Statue.</div>
  </div>

  <p>But for the perfectly horizontal position of the eyes, the aspect of
    some of the faces represented by Stephens would strike us as having
    a Mongolian cast. The magnificently sculptured hieroglyphics which
    cover the sides and backs of these huge idols, no doubt could tell
    the sealed story of Copan’s greatness and the attributes of its many
    gods, were the key once discovered. Everything is covered with these
    significant symbols, differing slightly from those at Palenque; but who
    will read them? In the court of the temple, a solid block of stone six
    feet square and four feet high, resting on four globular stones was
    sketched by Catherwood, and pronounced an altar by Stephens. Sixteen
    figures in profile, with turbaned heads, breast-plates, and each
    seated cross-legged on hieroglyphic-like cushions, are sculptured in
    low-relief, four figures being on each side of the block. The top of
    the altar is covered with thirty-six squares of hieroglyphics, shown
    in a cut on a future page. Besides numbers of masks, effigies and rows
    of death’s heads at Copan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span> there are sculptures of the face which we
    may believe to have been portraits. The Copan sculpture is generally
    admitted to be of a high order, and Stephens thinks it unsurpassed in
    Egypt. The receding forehead of most of the portraits have excited
    general interest, and are believed to be delineations of the priestly
    or aristocratic type. No weapons are sculptured at Copan, but on the
    contrary altars abound in considerable numbers, especially in front
    of the sculptured obelisks or idols. The presumption is therefore
    strong that this was a religious centre, unmolested by any enemy, and
    undisturbed by the alarm of war.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Nahua Sculpture.</i>—The Nahua sculpture is not of as high an order
    nor of as frequent occurrence as that of the Mayas. At Monte Alban in
    Oajaca, in a gallery within a mound, Castañeda sketched the sculptured
    profile shown in the accompanying cut, employed in Mr. Bancroft’s work.
    It is cut upon the face of a granite block about three feet square, and
    is interesting because of the Chinese-like queue which hangs from the
    figure’s head. At Mitla the grecques and arabesques which cover the
    façades of the several edifices are not sculptured, except in cases
    where large stones serve as lintels over doorways. On them the running
    borders are sculptured in low-relief, while the remainder of the
    profuse ornamentation is of the nature of mosaic work, being built into
    the wall.</p>

  <p>Several minor objects of sculpture found in the States of Oajaca and
    Vera Cruz might be cited, but their interest for the reader would be
    too insignificant to justify a description.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> One <span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>of the principal
    objects of this class and much superior to any of the others is a
    grotesque fountain cut in the living rock at Tusapan. The statue is
    that of a woman in a kneeling posture, and measures nineteen feet in
    height. The waters of a neighboring spring formerly ran into a basin
    formed among the plumes of the female’s head-dress, from which it
    found its way through the entire length of the figure, and flowed
    forth from beneath her skirts.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> At Panuco the traditional point
    of the arrival of the Nahuas, several rude limestone statues were
    found, some of which have been figured in the <cite>Journal of the
    London Geographical Society</cite>, by Mr. Vetch, one of which is copied
    by Mr. Bancroft.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> The marked features of these statues is the
    elaborateness of the style of head-dress worn. We cannot see that they
    are far removed in their style from similar statues dug from mounds
    in the Mississippi Valley. In the State of Puebla, at various points,
    especially at Tepexe el Viejo, at Tepeaca, and at Quanhquelchula,
    minor sculptures of animals, birds, reptiles, monsters, etc., were
    observed by Dupaix.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> Rattlesnakes were found plentiful both in
    sculptures and in a state of nature. At Cuernavaca, in the State of
    Mexico, numerous boulder-sculptures, finely executed in low-relief,
    exist. Dupaix has figured and Bancroft copied one in particular,
    showing a beautiful coat-of-arms, sculptured on the smooth face of a
    huge boulder. A circle of arrows and Maltese cross which compose them,
    are all symbolical of power.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> Similar coats-of-arms were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>observed
    in the State of Puebla. Probably the most remarkable sculpture found
    in the country occupied by the Nahuas, is that upon the walls of the
    pyramid of Xochicalco, illustrated on a preceding page.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> Most of
    the sculptures are of colossal dragons’ heads, which occur at each of
    the corners. Human figures, seated cross-legged and holding something
    like the Assyrian sun symbol in the left are found on the frieze,
    though some observers have considered this figure to be that of a
    curved cross-hilted sword, a weapon never employed by the Nahuas.
    The elaborate head-dresses and strings of enormous pearls worn by
    the seated figures bear a striking resemblance to the stuccoes of
    Palenque. At Xochimilco on the western shore of Lake Chalco, Dupaix
    found several interesting specimens of ancient sculpture.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> The
    most celebrated article of Aztec sculpture, unquestionably, is the
    calendar-stone, which, together with the so-called sacrificial stone
    and the idol Teoyaomiqui, was in December, 1790, dug up in the Plaza
    Mayor, in the city of Mexico, on the supposed site of the great
    teocalli, destroyed by the conquerors. The calendar-stone, now built
    into the wall of the cathedral, where it can be seen by all passers-by,
    is a rectangular block of porphyry, thirteen feet one inch square and
    three feet three inches thick, and of the enormous estimated weight of
    twenty-four tons. The sculptured portion of the block, on the exposed
    face, is contained in a circle, eleven feet one inch and four-fifths
    of an inch in diameter. The regularity and geometrical precision with
    which the figures are executed called forth enthusiastic admiration
    from Humboldt, and has been the source of equal wonderment to many
    later observers. Our cut is a reproduction of Charnay’s photograph,
    by means of the photo-engraving process, and may be relied upon as
    absolutely correct. Prescott considers that the original weight of the
    block before it was mutilated must have been nearly fifty tons; and
    as no similar stone is found within a radius of twenty-five miles of
    Mexico, that it must have been brought from the mountains beyond Lake
    Chalco.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> Some remarks upon the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>Aztec calendar will be found in
    the following chapter. The sacrificial stone is a cylindrical block of
    porphyry, nine feet ten inches in diameter and three feet seven inches
    thick, and is now lying in the courtyard of the University of Mexico.
    If the reader will imagine the border of the calendar-stone outside of
    the eight triangular points removed entirely, will substitute a concave
    basin in the place of the central face or sun, also instead of all the
    calendar signs intervening between the face and the circle, upon which
    the base of the four principal triangular figures rest, will imagine
    the existence of several concentric <span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>circles not unlike strings of
    beads, he will have a general idea of the top of the stone. We should
    not omit to state that a groove or channel leads from the central
    basin to the outer circumference. The use of the stone is a matter of
    controversy, Humboldt considering it the gladiatorial stone, Gama a
    calendar-stone, and Tylor that it was an altar on which animals were
    sacrificed. Fifteen groups of two human figures, each dressed in the
    insignia of royalty, are sculptured around its circumference. Bancroft,
    as well as several others, give cuts of the stone and sculptures.
    The horrid monster Teoyaomiqui—goddess of death—is sculptured in
    high-relief on a block of porphyry ten feet high and six feet wide
    and thick. Probably no mythology nor all the mythologies of the world
    besides could produce so hideous and unsightly a combination of
    reptile, human and infernal forms, as make up the three sides of this
    idol.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> Mr. Bancroft first figured the beautiful earthen burial
    vase dug up in the Plaza Tlatelulco and sketched by Col. Mayer. It is
    twenty-two inches high and fifteen and a half inches in diameter; a
    closely fitting lid most chastely sculptured covered it, as will be
    seen in the accompanying cut.</p>

  <p>Among the elegant sculptures upon one of its sides is a comely face
    surmounted by a crown, from each side of which project wings of
    the same character as were employed to symbolize the sun among the
    Assyrians.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> The original is pronounced one of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>finest relics
    preserved in the Mexican Museum. M. Waldeck has figured many beautiful
    examples of Mexican ceramic art preserved in the above collection as
    well as in others. The finest specimens of ancient terra-cotta work of
    which we have any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span> knowledge are shown in the cut, photographically
    reduced from Waldeck’s plate.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

  <p>No description can convey any idea of their beauty. The upper left-hand
    vase, it will be observed, is supported on three feet, each perforated
    by a perfect Maltese Cross. The central lower vase, of remarkable
    symmetry, is distinguished by the perfect <i lang="la">crux ansata</i> which
    adorns its side. The lower right and left hand figures are different
    views of a swinging lamp. These vases cannot but command the admiration
    of all who see them. M. Waldeck has delineated with remarkable artistic
    skill three specimens of Mexican mosaic work now in the Christy
    collection in London. One of these beautiful relics is shown in the
    cut, reduced from Waldeck’s colored plate for Mr. Bancroft’s work.</p>

  <p>However, the cut conveys but a faint idea of its beauty, especially
    of the handle. The blade is of semi-translucent chalcedony from the
    volcanic regions of Mexico, while the handle is a most artistic mosaic
    of bright green turquoise, malachite, and white and red shells. The
    blade is of a light straw-colored tint, and is mortised in the handle,
    which is wrapped nearest to the blade with what appears to be a golden
    braid. Mr. Bancroft remarks “it is certainly most extraordinary to
    find a people still in the stone age, as is proved by the blade, able
    to execute so perfect a piece of work as the handle exhibits.”<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
    Among the few <span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>relics recovered at Tula, the ancient Toltec capital
    Tollan, the column shown in the cut (from Mr. Bancroft’s work) is very
    interesting, both for its sculpture and for the exhibition it affords
    of the manner in which the Toltecs formed their columns, namely, by
    fastening the sections together by means of circular tenons. The
    largest block measures four feet long by two and a half in diameter.</p>

  <p>Our National Museum at Washington contains numerous fine specimens of
    Mexican terra-cotta ware, some of which have been figured recently
    in Dr. Charles Rau’s “Archæological Collection of the U. S. National
    Museum.”<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Two large vases in particular demand attention. These
    were brought to the United States by General Alfred Gibbs at the close
    of the Mexican war, and are shown in the cut.</p>

  <p>The upper vase, which is thirteen and a half inches high, is very
    elaborately wrought, being surrounded with ten female figures in
    relief, each alternate figure bearing a child on the left arm. It is
    noticeable that the head-dresses of the figures holding the children
    are more elaborate than those of the remaining figures. The second or
    lower vase, Dr. Rau considers equal to many Etruscan or Greek vases
    in gracefulness of outline. “The vessel may be compared to a pitcher
    with two handles, standing opposite each other, and with two mouths
    projecting between them.” Among the terra-cotta images of Mexican
    origin in the National Museum the two shown in the cut are of interest.
    The left-hand figure is that of a woman pressing her hands upon her
    ears. The face represents an aged <span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>individual. The Museum possesses
    almost an exact duplicate of this image. The right-hand figure is
    much smaller and is hollow, enclosing a clay ball, and was probably
    used as a rattle. It is scarcely necessary for us to remark that the
    seeming analogies between the Maya (Central American) sculpture and
    that of Egypt have often been noted. Juarros, in speaking of Palenque
    art, says: “The hieroglyphics, symbols and emblems which have been
    discovered in the temples, bear so strong a resemblance to those of
    the Egyptians, as to encourage the supposition that a colony of that
    nation may have founded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span> city of Palenque or Culhuacan.”<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
    Giordan found, as he thought, the most striking analogies between the
    Central American remains, as well as those of Mexico, and those of
    the Egyptians. The idols and monuments he considers of the same form
    in both countries, while the hieroglyphics of Palenque do not differ
    from those of ancient Thebes.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Señor Melgar, in a communication
    to the Mexican Geographical Society, has called attention to the
    frequent occurrence of the (Τ) <i>tau</i> at Palenque, and has more
    studiously advocated the early relationship of the Palenqueans to
    Egypt than any other reliable writer.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> He cites Dupaix’s <cite>Third
    Expedition</cite>, page 77 and plates 26 and 27, where in the first figure
    is a goddess with a necklace supporting a <i>tau</i> like medallion to
    which the explorer adds the remark that such is “the symbol in Egypt
    of reproduction or abundance.” In the second plate he finds an altar
    dedicated expressly to the <i>tau</i>. He considers that the cultus
    of this, the symbol of the active principle in nature, prevailed in
    Mexico in many places. Señor Melgar also refers to two idols found
    south of the city of Mexico, “in one of which two symbols were united,
    namely, the Cosmogonic egg, symbolical of creation, and two faces,
    symbols of the generative principle. The other symbolized creation
    in the bursting forth of an egg. These symbols are not found in the
    Aztec mythology, but belong to the Indian, Egyptian, Greek, Persian,
    Japanese and other cosmogonies.” This, the Señor considers proof that
    these peoples were the primitive colonists of that region, and seeks
    to sustain his views by references to the Dharma Sastra of Manou and
    the Zend Avesta. The reader has no doubt been surprised at the frequent
    occurrence of the [Τ]-shaped niches in the Palenque palace, and has
    observed the same symbol employed on some of the hieroglyphics of
    the Tablet of the Cross. The Egyptian tau, one of the members of the
    <i lang="la">Crux ansata</i>, is certainly present at Palenque, but whether it
    was derived from any one of the Mediterranean peoples who <span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>employed it,
    cannot be ascertained. Among the Egyptians it signified “life,” as is
    shown by the best Egyptologists.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> The tau was usually surmounted
    by a roundlet, though such was not always the case. On a stele from
    Korasabad, an eagle-headed man is depicted as holding the oval in one
    hand and the cross in the other.<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> M. Mariette recently, while
    exploring the ancient temple of Denderah, discovered the sacred symbol
    in a niche of the holy of holies. It is probable that this emblem was
    the central object of interest in these inner precincts of the temple,
    as it was preserved with scrupulous care as the hidden wisdom.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
    Macrobius tells us that the <i lang="la">crux ansata</i> was the hieroglyphic
    sign of Osiris or the Sun,<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> but other writers inform us that it
    was an ancient symbol of majesty and divinity, and so employed in
    a modified form in the hands of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> The
    associations of the tau in Central America are such as to lead us to
    believe that it may have had a significance analogous to that which
    it possessed on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Nile, and the
    Ganges. The Palenque Cross tablet is a most singular work of American
    antiquity, and though Mr. Stephens attempted to prove that no analogy
    exists between it and Egyptian sculptures, still Mr. Bancroft has
    shown that the former was unfortunate in his selection of Egyptian
    specimens for the purpose of comparison, since marked analogies between
    the sculpture of the Vocal Memnon of Thebes and the top of the fallen
    obelisk at Carnac and the Palenque Tablets exist.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

  <p>It has been argued that the Egyptian and Palenque sculpture resemble
    each other in that both are generally in profile; but the trivialness
    of the reasoning will be at once apparent. On the contrary, Mr.
    Bancroft remarks, “Sculpture in Egypt is for the most part in intaglio,
    in America it is usually in relief.” Notwithstanding the oft-repeated
    assertion that a resemblance between Egyptian and Maya hieroglyphics
    exist, no one of the Egyptologists so successful in their chosen field
    have been able to decipher the Maya writing. It is not improbable
    that the Palenque and Copan civilization received its first impulse
    from some of the peoples of the southern or eastern shores of the
    Mediterranean, but from which it would be impossible to say even if we
    were certain that such was the case. Whatever of a foreign character
    it may have had at first has been mostly lost in the independent
    development of new and original characteristics, the natural outgrowth
    of new wants and new conditions, arising through the lapse of many
    centuries. The latter remark we think may be applied with even more
    certainty to the Nahua civilization as displayed in its sculpture.
    All through Mexico the favorite subject for the Toltec or Aztec
    sculptor was the serpent, generally the rattlesnake. Mr. Bancroft in
    his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>fourth volume has given numerous examples of this fact. Serpent
    sculpture was also common among the Mayas, but to a less extent, and
    it is not improbable that the symbol entered into their art through
    the Quichés—a mixed people composed of Mayas and Nahuas. We have
    already observed the same disposition to sculpture the rattlesnake
    among the Mound-builders. In the great serpent upwards of a thousand
    feet in length on Brush Creek, Adams County, Ohio, we find a striking
    analogy to the tendency of Mexican art. Furthermore, the great serpent
    grasps in its jaws (if they may be so called) an immense oval figure
    of precisely the shape of an egg, and “the combined figure is regarded
    as a symbolical illustration of the Oriental cosmological idea of the
    serpent and the egg.” We have seen in the remarks of Señor Melgar that
    two examples of the egg possessing precisely the same significance
    which is attached to it in Eastern Asia were found near the City of
    Mexico. The part which the serpent symbol plays in the south and east
    Asiatic sculpture and mythology is probably well known to the reader;
    and if not, a perusal of Maurace’s <cite>Indian Antiquities</cite> or Moor’s
    <cite>Hindu Pantheon</cite> will satisfy him that it occupied a place equally
    important among Nahuas and Hindoos. The great serpent in Ohio may be a
    connecting link between the art of both Mexicans and Asiatics. In the
    course of independent development which the Nahuas underwent during
    thousands of years, the cosmological symbol of the egg may have been
    lost and supplanted by that of the serpent alone, the emblem of the
    life principle in both America and Asia. However, we may safely close
    these speculations with the conclusion that though the Mayas and Nahuas
    were probably descendants of foreign stock, their civilization, so far
    as we are able to judge from their arts, was indigenous—developed upon
    our soil, and offering but few analogies to any other.</p>

  <p><i>Hieroglyphics.</i>—No well authenticated Mound-builder hieroglyphics
    have as yet come to light. The Grave Creek Mound tablet we believe is
    now shown unquestionably to be an archæological fraud. The Cincinnati
    tablet figured in our first chapter seems to bear some symbolic signs
    upon its face, but no resemblance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span> can be traced between them and any
    other known hieroglyphic signs. The Davenport tablet if genuine is
    of great interest in that it abounds in hieroglyphics, some of which
    are not unlike some of the signs employed by the Aztecs; besides, the
    element of picture-writing so common to that people plays a prominent
    part on both sides of that mysterious stone. Col. Charles Whittlesey,
    in the second chapter of his <cite>Report to the Centennial Commission
    of Ohio</cite> (already cited), has figured and described rock sculpture
    near Barnesville, Newark, Independence, Amherst and Wellsville, most of
    which are of the lowest grade of savage art, and we think can only be
    attributed to the red Indian.</p>

  <p>Mr. W. H. Holmes has furnished specimens of picture-writing of a
    rude character found engraven in the rocks of the cañon of the Rio
    Mancos and San Juan, but there is no evidence that they are or are not
    the work of the Cliff-dwellers whose works abound upon neighboring
    rocks.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> We have already called attention to the tablets of
    hieroglyphics at Palenque, Copan and in Yucatan, a specimen of which is
    shown in a cut on <a href="#i_390">page 390</a>. The accompanying cut, employed by Stevens,
    Baldwin and Bancroft, show the thirty-six squares of hieroglyphics
    engraven upon the top of a Copan altar.</p>

  <p>In addition to these stone and stucco records, the Mayas had books,
    which Bishop Landa describes as written on a large leaf doubled in
    folds and enclosed between two boards which they ornamented; they wrote
    on both sides of the paper, in columns accommodated to the folds;
    the paper they made from the roots of trees, and coated it with a
    white varnish on which one could write well. These books were called
    <i>Analtees</i>, a word which, according to Villagutierre, signifies
    the same as history.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> Bishop Landa confesses to having burned
    a great number of the Maya books because they contained nothing in
    which were not superstitions and falsities of the devil.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> Bancroft
    has quoted from Peter Martyr a description of these books, which
    conveys the additional <span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>information that they were written on many
    leaves joined together but folded so that when opened two pages are
    presented to view.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> Three of the Maya manuscripts are known to
    have escaped the vandalism of the early Fathers. These are, first, the
    Mexican MS. No. 2 of the Imperial Library at Paris, called by Rosny
    the <cite>Codex Peresianus</cite>, which has been photographed by order of
    the French government, but we believe is still unedited. The second,
    the <cite>Dresden Codex</cite>, in the Royal Library at Dresden, a complete
    copy of which was published by Lord Kingsborough. It is a Maya, and not
    an Aztec MS., as is proven by its marked resemblance to the tablets
    of Palenque and Copan, a fact pointed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>out by Mr. Stephens, though at
    the date of his exploration everything was pronounced Aztec.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> The
    third, the <cite>Manuscript Troano</cite>, found by Brasseur de Bourbourg at
    Madrid in 1865 in the possession of Señor Tro y Ortolano, from whom
    it derives its name, is a Maya MS. of unknown origin and history. The
    French government and the Commission Scientifique du Mexique reproduced
    it in fac-simile by means of chromo-lithography, and Brasseur, with
    the expenditure of great labor, attempted to translate part of it,
    which he has published; but in a subsequent work he confesses that
    he began his reading at the wrong end of the manuscript, which, as
    Mr. Bancroft humorously remarks, was a “trifling error perhaps in the
    opinion of the enthusiastic Abbé, but a somewhat serious one as it
    appears to scientific men.”<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> Mr. Bancroft has reproduced a page
    of the MS. Troano in his work, and accompanied it with a condensed
    account from the Abbé’s description as follows: “The original is
    written on a strip of maguey paper about fourteen feet long and nine
    inches wide, the surface of which is covered with a whitish varnish,
    on which the figures are painted in black, red, blue and brown. It is
    folded fan-like in thirty-five folds, presenting when shut much the
    appearance of a modern large octavo volume. The hieroglyphics cover
    both sides of the paper, and the writing is consequently divided into
    seventy pages, each about five by nine inches, having been apparently
    executed after the paper was folded, so that the folding does not
    interfere with the written matter. * * * The regular lines of written
    characters are uniformly in black, while the pictorial portions, of
    what may perhaps be considered representative signs, are in red and
    brown, chiefly the former, and the blue appears for the most part as
    a background in some of the pages.”<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Notwithstanding the bigoted
    spirit exhibited by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>Bishop Landa in his destruction of the native Maya
    books in the presence of their sorrowful and helpless owners, he did
    one act of service for the antiquarian, which will ever entitle him to
    the gratitude of every student of ancient American civilization. That
    act was the record which he made of the Maya hieroglyphic alphabet. The
    Bishop has left us scarcely two and a half octavo pages (of his work as
    edited by Brasseur de Bourbourg) upon this important subject, yet it is
    the only known key to the mysteries of Palenque, Copan and the numerous
    inscriptions found in Yucatan. His explanation of the manner in which
    letters are combined into words is not clear, and though Mr. Bancroft
    has translated it literally and introduced parenthetic explanations,
    still the sense is not very apparent. Brasseur de Bourbourg in his
    French translation has not succeeded much better, and complains of
    Landa’s style as being untranslatable. One important fact, however,
    is deducible from the Bishop’s remarks and example, namely, that the
    Maya letters were formed into words in much the same order as in the
    English and other languages which read from the left to the right.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
    Landa’s alphabet is given in the accompanying cut which is an exact
    photographic reproduction of the original.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Hieroglyphics on the Copan Altar.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Landa adds nothing after this table except the remark: “Of the letters
    which here fail, this language is wanting and has others added of
    ours, for other things of which they have need, and already they do
    not use these characters of theirs, especially <span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>the young people who
    have learned ours.”<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> Landa has left us other hieroglyphic signs,
    relating to the Maya months and days, which will be given in the
    next chapter. Many of the hieroglyphics in his alphabet are plainly
    recognizable in the three Maya MSS. which we have named, though it is
    quite certain that other signs, which are wanting in his list, are
    found not only in the MSS. but also among the inscriptions of the
    several localities we have already described. Besides the attempts
    made by Brasseur de Bourbourg to decipher the Maya writing, three
    Américanistes in particular have bestowed labor upon the subject. These
    are Mr. Wm. Bollaert,<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> M. Hyacinthe de Charencey,<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> and M. Leon

  <p>By means of Landa’s key, Mr. Bollaert obtained encouraging results
    from hieroglyphics figured in Stephens’ works. In that author’s
    <cite>Yucatan</cite>, vol. ii, page 292, is seen a sculptured figure with
    hieroglyphics represented on the upper part of the door called Akatzeeb
    at Chichen-Itza. This tablet is examined by Mr. Bollaert with the
    following result: “The figure (male) is nude; the cap is like those on
    the figures at Kabab, and has an ornament round the neck; the large
    crucible-form before him contains fire, in which some small animal
    is being burnt or sacrificed. Comparing the hieroglyphs on either
    side of the figure with the Maya key, I get the following words:
    <i>Ahau</i>, ‘king’; <i>oc</i>, ‘leg’; <i>Muluc</i>, ‘to unite’;
    <i>ik</i>, ‘courage’; <i>cib</i>, ‘copal’; <i>eznab</i>, ‘magician’;
    <i>no</i>, ‘frog’; which may mean that the magician has in the crucible
    a frog to be sacrificed, in which copal as incense is used. The two
    lines of hieroglyphs give something like the following: Kings must
    die—they have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>courage, and after death are united to those who went
    before them. The king is with his fathers; the chief and his family
    burn copal and mourn for his death.”<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> On the tablet of the cross
    at Palenque, Mr. Bollaert found in squares <i>eznab</i>, “magician”;
    <i>dz</i>, “a hand”; the “aspiration sign” ⋃; and a part
    of <i>zip</i>, “tree.” Among the hieroglyphs he traced <i>ahau</i>,
    “king”; <i>zip</i>, “tree”; <i>akbal</i>, “a plant”; <i>pax</i>,
    “a musical instrument.” Mr. Bollaert has attempted to read several
    other inscriptions with no more satisfactory results.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> One or
    two of the same scholar’s attempts with the <cite>Dresden Codex</cite>
    yield the following: <em>We come to thy presence to implore. The young
    female implores before the deity, she weeps but has courage.</em> In
    a group representing a king and a young female, he reads: <em>She has
    made a vow about the king to the magician, the king is happy.</em>
    Again: <em>The sacred bird chel is sacrificed, there is weeping; the
    bride weeps for the bird, she makes a vow or prays for the king, she
    offers a tortoise, a great feast is given.</em><a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> M. de Charencey
    translates the hieroglyph found just above the child which is being
    offered to the bird on the tablet of the cross at Palenque, by the
    word <i>Hunabku</i>, “the only holy one.” He also finds the name of
    <i>Kukulcan</i> and <i>eznab</i>, “magician,” the name of a month.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
    M. de Rosny in his able essay on the decipherment of the hieratic
    writings of Central America has undertaken the solution of this
    interesting and perplexing problem in a scientific manner, and we have
    the fullest confidence that his system constructed on Landa’s key
    will open to us the books and inscriptions of the Mayas. But two of
    the four parts which constitute the work have been published, still
    we think sufficient data has been placed at the hands of scholars
    by M. de Rosny to justify the opinion that if the remainder of his
    essay should never appear, the work of interpreting some of the Maya
    writings might be carried on with reasonable certainty. Landa’s key
    contains seventy-one signs (twenty for the days, eighteen for the
    months, and thirty-three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span> in the alphabet.) M. de Rosny, by a careful
    examination of all the hieratic texts of the Mayas which are known,
    has discovered more than seven hundred different signs. Of this number
    he has deciphered and classified four hundred and thirty-nine as
    follows: Alphabetic signs, including Landa’s (of which all the others
    are but varieties), two hundred and sixty-two; signs of the days, one
    hundred and fifty-nine; and the eighteen signs of the months given by
    Landa. All these signs are classified in a double folio plate (Pl.
    XIII) which we believe deserves to be regarded as the larger portion
    of the much-sought-for Maya Rosetta stone. Considerable difference of
    opinion has existed as to the direction in which the hieroglyphics
    should be read. Brasseur held the view that the proper order was from
    right to left, and that the beginning of a book was where our books
    end. This mistake brought down the ridicule of scholars upon the Abbé’s
    head, when it was discovered that he had begun at the wrong end to
    translate the <cite>Troano MS.</cite> Mr. Bollaert says, “I have read from
    the bottom upwards and from right to left.”<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> Dr. Brinton<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> has
    suggested some such order as the following arrangement of the word
    <em>marvellous</em>:</p>

  <div class="center">
    o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ll &nbsp;&nbsp;m<br>
    u&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a<br>
    s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r</div>

  <p>M. de Rosny has shown that the statement of Landa and the fact that the
    human faces shown in the hieroglyphs look toward the left, indicate
    that the signs should be read from left to right.<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> In rare cases
    this order is reversed, as is seen on a couple of leaves of the
    <cite>Codex Peresianus</cite>. There are, no doubt, numerous instances in
    which the signs are arranged in perpendicular columns, and the order in
    which such columns are to be read is not the same in all manuscripts.
    In the Maya inscriptions and manuscripts, the “illustrations” or
    pictorial figures are interwoven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span> with the alphabetic signs forming
    an important part of the writing. In many cases a page of MS. (as
    shown in Rosny’s plates) is divided into sections or squares, in which
    the hieroglyphics are inseparably connected with grotesque figures
    which accompany them and form a part of the writing. M. de Rosny has
    undertaken the classification and interpretation of all these figures
    which are found in the existing Maya MSS. This doubtless will prove
    an important auxiliary to the table of signs already alluded to. We
    may reasonably expect that since M. de Rosny has shown the extensive
    character of the Maya phonetic and symbolic alphabet, he will furnish
    us examples of its application in the practical interpretation of
    the hieroglyphics, in the latter part of his work. Recently Dr. Ph.
    Valentini has pronounced the Landa alphabet a Spanish fabrication, of
    later date than the conquest. See <cite>Proceedings of Amer. Antiquarian
    Soc.</cite> for April, 1880.</p>

  <p>We do not deem it necessary to assure the reader that while the Aztec
    picture-writing was not as far advanced in the scale of graphic
    development as the system employed by the Mayas, still it was an
    accurate means of communication and of recording events. The “scribes”
    of the Mexicans were an educated class of men, who with strictest
    accuracy painted in hieroglyphic symbols the record of national,
    historic and traditional affairs, as well as the tribute rolls, the
    calendar with its feast days, the stated services of the gods, the
    genealogical tables of noble and royal personages, and even the
    customs of the humble classes. No doubt many educated persons who did
    not belong to the priestly and lettered class, were acquainted with
    the system employed, and many others understood it sufficiently to
    recognize calendar and feast signs. The Aztec books were painted mostly
    on cotton cloth, prepared skins and maguey paper, and when not rolled
    were folded fan-like and bound with thin wooden covers, like the Maya
    books. The priests who accompanied the conquerors and immediately
    followed them, mistook the pictured figures painted in these books to
    be representations of heathen deities, and consequently inaugurated a
    system of wholesale destruction of all the picture-writing. Las Casas
    informs us that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span> actuated by the fear that in matters of
    religion the existence of these books would be injurious. The infamous
    crime committed against the cause of knowledge and the irreparable
    injury done to the natives, their successors, and to students of
    history for all time, by the destruction of those valuable MSS., must
    ever remain an unerasable blot upon the name of the early church in
    Mexico, and must be ranked with the worst deeds of Goths and Vandals.
    Juan de Zumárraga, the chief of these sacrilegious destroyers who
    committed the annals of the Mexican States publicly to the flames
    in his tour of the principal cities of the country, will ever be
    remembered with proper contempt. Fortunately, many of the MSS. were
    hidden by their owners and have since come to light; the greater
    number of these, however, were tribute rolls, which, down to the last
    century, played an important part in the Mexican courts of justice.
    Prescott informs us that “until late in the last century, there was
    a professor in the University of Mexico especially devoted to the
    study of the national picture-writing. But as this was with a view to
    legal proceedings, his information probably was limited to deciphering
    titles.” In the course of time the priests became acquainted with the
    harmless nature of the hieroglyphics, through their use by the natives
    in their making confessions and in recording the Lord’s prayer. Many
    documents written since the conquest were provided by their authors
    with a Spanish translation or with an explanation in Aztec written
    with Spanish letters. Many of these are in existence, and with a few
    authentic documents, written previous to the conquest, are preserved
    in public and private libraries of Europe and this country, the finest
    collection of which is that of the National Museum of the University
    of Mexico. The reader is no doubt already familiar with the splendid
    fac-similes of several Mexican MSS. published in Lord Kingsborough’s
    work. Mr. Bancroft has concisely narrated the events and vicissitudes
    which have attended the transmission of some of these documents through
    the hands of successive owners to their present depositories.<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>Several writers on hieroglyphic systems, and the above author among
    them, have classified the progressive steps of picture-writing into
    <em>representative</em>, <em>symbolic</em>, and <em>phonetic</em>. Of these,
    the first is by far the simplest, and has invariably preceded the
    others in the development of the graphic art. It was natural for the
    savage to represent an object by a picture, in which that object was
    surrounded with certain conditions; at first the entire object was
    pictured, but subsequently only a portion of the object, as in the
    case of a bird, the head or foot or wing in the more advanced stages
    of art, would be substituted for the object itself. In symbolic
    picture-writing, we find an attempt at representing abstract ideas and
    actions. Some quality or attribute of a person is portrayed by means of
    the representative process, by symbols which would naturally seem to
    suggest the distinguishing characteristic of the person or occasion. A
    certain Aztec festival might be symbolized by the conventional calendar
    sign, an altar, a flint knife held by a human hand, and a smoking human
    heart. Phonetic picture-writing is, of course, dependent upon the
    sounds of the language for which it is designed. Its province is to
    represent those sounds by pictures of objects in whose names the sounds
    occur. Words, syllables and elementary sounds which are represented
    by alphabets, are thus gradually evolved in the progression which
    follows. Mr. Bancroft, by a most ingenious example, has illustrated
    this principle as applied to our own language. “According to this
    system,” he says, “the <img class="iglyph-a" src="The%20North%20Americans%20of%20Antiquity,%20by%20John%20T.%20Short_files/hand.png" alt="hand pointing up"> signifies successively
    the word ‘hand,’ the syllable ‘hand’ in handsome, the sound ‘ha’ in
    happy, the aspiration ‘h’ in head, and finally, by simplifying its
    form or writing it rapidly, the <img class="iglyph-a" src="The%20North%20Americans%20of%20Antiquity,%20by%20John%20T.%20Short_files/hand.png" alt="hand pointing up">
    becomes <img class="iglyph-a" src="The%20North%20Americans%20of%20Antiquity,%20by%20John%20T.%20Short_files/hand2.png" alt="hand outline"> and then the ‘h’ of the alphabet.”<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> The
    Aztecs never reached the last stage of phonetic development, namely,
    the alphabet. They, however, employed the system in the syllabic
    formation of words to a very considerable extent. The priests soon
    found the natives applying their art of writing to the record of the
    standard expressions employed in teaching the new faith. Amen was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>expressed by the sign of water, <i>atl</i> associated with a maguey
    plant, <i>metl</i> which united gave the word <i>atl-metl</i>, or after
    the ever present Aztec termination <i>tl</i> is stricken off, we have
    <i>a-me</i>, an approximation to our word Amen. Mr. Bancroft gives also
    the following example of the manner in which the name Teocaltitlan was
    expressed by this syllabic-phonetic writing: “It is written in one of
    the manuscripts of the Boturini collection by a pictured pair of lips,
    <i>tentli</i>, for the syllable <i>te</i>; footsteps, symbolic of a
    road, <i>otli</i> for <i>o</i>; a house, <i>calli</i> for <i>cal</i>;
    and teeth, <i>tlantli</i> for <i>tlanti</i>, being a common connective
    syllable.” We think the reader will find a clearer illustration in the
    word Chapultepec, which literally means “hill of the grasshopper.”
    By reference to the Aztec migration map which has been published by
    several authors<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> (the most correct copy accessible to the general
    reader is that by Bancroft).<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> A hill surmounted by a grasshopper
    will be observed among the figures. The same representation in
    different form will be seen in Boturini’s picture-map of the migration.
    Chapultepec is well known as the royal hill, a short distance west of
    the city of Mexico, celebrated as the country residence of Montezuma.
    Numerous similar examples might be selected from the migration maps
    of this combination of the three methods employed. Proper names were
    always expressed in a similar manner. An example of the representative
    and symbolic stages of the picture-writing of the Aztecs has been given
    by Mr. Bancroft from the <cite>Codex Mendoza</cite> in Kingsborough.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> We
    here reproduce the plate used in the <cite>Native Races</cite>. It describes
    four steps or periods in the education of children; each period is
    supposed to refer to a particular year. In the upper left-hand group
    we see a father (fig. 3) punishing his son by holding him over the
    fumes of burning chile (fig. 5); in the right-hand group the mother
    threatens her daughter with similar punishment. In the second group
    (figs. 12–13), a father punishes his son by exposing him <span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>bound hand
    and foot on the damp ground. A bad boy twelve years of age, according
    to Aztec custom was always punished in this way, and his punishment
    lasted during an entire day. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span> disobedient girl of the same age was
    obliged to rise in the night and sweep the whole house, as is shown
    in the right-hand group, or, as no tear is seen in her eye, she may
    be learning. At the age of eight years children were only shown the
    instrument of punishment; at ten they were pricked with maguey thorns,
    or if still unruly, were whipped. The above groups show the methods
    employed during the eleventh and twelfth years, after which age a child
    was supposed to be pretty well disciplined. In the third group a father
    directs his boys (fig. 21) how to transport wood, both upon the back
    and in the canoe, while the mother teaches the daughter (fig. 23) to
    make tortillas and use the mealing stone and other utensils (figs. 25,
    26, 28); the tortillas are also represented (fig. 27). In the fourth
    group the son learns the use of the fish-net and the daughter that of
    the loom. The allowance of tortillas apportioned to the children at the
    ages represented are shown in figs. 2, 8, 11, 16, 20, 24, 30 and 34.
    The remaining figures are not representative, but symbolic. The small
    circles (figs. 1, 10, 19, 29) are numerals indicating that the child
    was successively eleven, twelve, thirteen and fourteen years of age. A
    circle or dot was always used for a unit. The comma-like figure issuing
    from the mouth of the parent is the symbol of speech. The tears in the
    children’s eyes need no explanation. The singular figure (17) above
    the girl in the second group is said to be symbolical of night, and to
    indicate that the sweeping was required in the night.</p>

    they are to be found correctly reproduced. Mr. Delafield sought to
    find an analogy between the Aztec and Egyptian hieroglyphic systems
    on no other ground than that both were representative, symbolic and
    phonetic, a most wonderful discovery indeed.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> Notwithstanding this
    fact, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>and many similar efforts, no marked analogy between the Aztec

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="smcap">Map of Yucatan.</span>—We have found it impossible in this
      chapter to convey any adequate idea of the number and extent of the
      ruins scattered over Central America and Mexico. Only by reference
      to an accurately prepared map, having distinctness and detail, can
      a proper understanding of this interesting field be reached. Maps
      of Northern and Central Mexico alone, meeting the requirements,
      have for some time been accessible, but a reliable map of Yucatan
      and of neighboring States has long been a desideratum. This great
      want has recently been supplied by the publication in New York of
      a rare specimen of cartography, bearing the title, <cite>Mapa de la
      Peninsula de Yucatan, compilado por Joaquin Hübbe y Andres Azuar
      Perez y revisado y aumentado con datos importantes por C. Hermann
      Berendt</cite>, 1878—size, 28 × 36 inches. Stephens, in his work on
      <cite>Yucatan</cite>, indicated the sites of many remains discovered by
      him; but Señor Perez has for the first time brought before us a
      view of the whole field, including Yucatan and Campeachy, together
      with the greater part of Tabasco and Belize, and portions of
      Guatemala and Chiapas, showing, by means of appropriate symbols,
      the great number of known ruins. The map has met with merited

  <p><i>Chronology and Calendar Systems.</i>—No tablet or relic of
    Mound-builder origin has yet been discovered, which can be said to
    give any clue to the system of chronology employed by that people.
    Several supposed calendar stones have been found, such, for instance,
    as the Cincinnati Tablet referred to in Chapter I, and the Tablet
    from Mississippi in the possession of Wm. Marshall Anderson, Esq.,
    of Circleville, Ohio. However, their character is only a matter of
    conjecture, since no progress whatever has been made toward evolving
    any system from them. Farther south, on the soil where a higher
    civilization flourished, we meet with two calendar systems, which,
    while they have several points of resemblance, are quite distinct from
    each other.</p>

  <p>The first of these, the Maya, is probably the most ancient. Bishop
    Landa is our chief authority in this field, though Don Juan Pio
    Perez, a more recent writer, also familiar with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span> Maya language,
    has furnished us some material.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> Bishop Landa informs us that the
    Mayas had a year of 365 days and 6 hours divided into months (a month
    being called a <i>U</i>) in two ways, first into months of thirty days
    each, and second, into eighteen months of twenty days each. As the
    Bishop makes no explanation of the former statement, we are unable
    to determine whether the months of thirty days each were employed in
    Yucatan prior to the conquest, or not, but we are rather inclined to
    the opinion that they were not.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp84" id="i_436">
    <img src="The%20North%20Americans%20of%20Antiquity,%20by%20John%20T.%20Short_files/i_436.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="caption smcap">The Maya Days.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The month of twenty days was called the <i>Uinal-Hun-ekeh</i>, and
    might commence on any of the days represented by the hieroglyphics in
    the left-hand column of the table of days. These months were eighteen
    in number, thus making a year of 360 days. The Mayas, however,
    corrected the error by adding five intercalary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span> days and six hours to
    the 360 days; and once every four years, Landa informs us, they counted
    366 days a year. The five supplementary days were considered unlucky,
    and were known as the “nameless days” because they were never called
    by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span> particular designation. The accompanying cut is a photographic
    reproduction of Landa’s plate, and shows accurately the Maya days in
    their proper order.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>
    (<a href="#i_436">Page 436</a>.)</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">The Maya Months.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Though the intercalary days were “nameless” and characterized as
    the “bed or chamber of the year,” “the mother of the year,” “bed of
    creation,” “travail of the year,” “lying days,” or “bad days,” etc.,
    still five of the above twenty were reckoned for them in regular order.</p>

  <p>The year began on a day corresponding to our 16th of July—“a date,” as
    Mr. Bancroft observes, “which varies only forty-four hours from the
    time when the sun passes the zenith—an approximation as accurate as

  <p>Though these translations may seem uninteresting by themselves, they
    are of great value when taken in connection with Landa’s alphabet and

    attempts to translate the inscriptions and codices.</p>

  <p>Another division of time among the Mayas of a complicated character
    was the Katun or Cycle of 52 years. The Katun was composed of four
    periods (indictions or weeks) of 13 years each, enumerated by a system
    of reckoning kept simultaneously with the current reckoning of days,
    months and years. The mode of computing the Katunes was, according to
    Landa and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
    Perez, briefly as follows:<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> The year was divided into twenty-eight
    periods of thirteen days each. These periods for convenience have
    been called weeks, and the number of days of which each is composed
    may have been suggested by the number of days embraced in the moon’s
    <em>increase</em>, and <em>decrease</em>, twenty-six days constituting
    about the actual time in which the moon is seen above the horizon
    during each lunation.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> The weeks were divided off by counting
    thirteen days from the beginning of the list of days shown on <a href="#i_436">page
    436</a>, Kan constituting the first day of the first week and according to
    usage applying its name to the weeks. The week was consequently called
    by the name of the day on which it began. Caban being the fourteenth
    day of the current month, became the first day of another week; but
    as not enough days remain to complete it, the enumeration is begun
    again and continued down to Muluc, the sixth day of the next month.
    Oc, the seventh day, then becomes the starting point for another week,
    which assumes its name, and thus the computation is carried on <i>ad
    infinitum</i>. A numeral preceded each day designating its position in
    the week. The people of Yucatan painted a small circle in which they
    placed the four hieroglyphics of the initial days which constitute
    the left-hand column of signs given on <a href="#i_436">page 436</a>. Kan was placed in
    the east, Muluc in the north, Ix in the west and Cauac in the south.
    These signs were termed the “carriers of the years” because no month or
    year could begin on any of the twenty days, but on one of these. Since
    twenty days constitute a current month, it is apparent that every month
    in a given year must begin with the same day. However, the introduction
    of the five intercalary days at the end of the year, changed the
    initial day on which the months of the different years began. In
    reckoning the Katun it is further observed that the numeral which
    indicates the day of the week (of thirteen days) which falls upon the
    first of a given month, varies. Supposing the month to begin on Kan and
    the numeral of the first day to be 1, the numerals indicative <span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>of the
    days of the week (composed of thirteen days) falling on Kan throughout
    the eighteen months, would be, 8, 9, 3, 10, 4, 11, 5, 12, 6, 13, 7, 1,
    8, 2, 9, 3.</p>

  <p>The Katun year consisted, as we have seen, of twenty-eight weeks of
    thirteen days each, and <em>one additional day</em>, making in all 365
    days. If the year commenced with number one of the week, the additional
    day (the 365th) caused it to end on the same number. The ensuing year
    would then begin with number two, and so on through the thirteen
    numbers of the week, as follows: 1. Kan, 2. Muluc, 3. Ix, 4. Cauac,
    5. Kan, 6. Muluc, 7. Ix, 8. Cauac, 9. Kan, 10. Muluc, 11. Ix, 12.
    Cauac, 13. Kan, thus completing an indiction or week of years. The same
    combination of names and numerals can only occur after the lapse of the
    Katun or cycle comprising four of these indictions or fifty-two years.
    Not only the years of the week, but also the indictions themselves were
    named by the four initial symbols. The first indiction of each Katun
    being named Kan, the second Muluc, the third Ix, and the fourth Cauac.
    The completion of a Katun or fifty-two years was celebrated with feasts
    and rejoicings as an event of great moment. A monument was reared as a
    memorial of the event. It is not impossible that the great number of
    pillars, observed by Stephens at Chichen-Itza were of this character,
    serving as landmarks to Maya chronology.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

  <p>A third division of time employed by the Mayas was the great cycle of
    312 years, composed, according to Señor Perez,<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> of thirteen periods
    of time, each embracing twenty-four years. Each of these thirteen
    periods was called an Ahau Katun, and was divided into two parts.
    The first part, embracing twenty years, was enclosed in a square and
    called <i>Amaytum lamayte</i>, or <i>lamaytum</i>; and the other part
    of four years, which formed as it were a pedestal for the first, was
    called <i>Chek oc Katun</i>, or <i>lath oc Katun</i>, meaning “stool”
    or “pedestal.” He affirms that the latter were intercalated, therefore
    believed to be unfortunate as were the five supplementary days of the
    year. This may account <span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>for their not being reckoned with the Ahau
    Katun by any other writer. Just here lies the discrepancy which has
    created most of the confusion in the investigation of this subject.
    However, if we accept the statement of Señor Perez, that the Ahau Katun
    embraced twenty-four years instead of the testimony of every other
    writer that it included but twenty years, we shall have moderately
    fair sailing until we split upon the rock of his inaccuracies as to
    dates. He tells us that these periods took their name from Ahau, the
    second of those years that began in Cauac, and from the order of the
    numerals accompanying those days would succeed each other according
    to the numbers 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2. The Indians
    established the number 13 Ahau as the first, because some great event
    happened in that year. If the 13 Ahau Katun began on a second day of
    the year, it must have been the year which began on 12 Cauac, and the
    12th of the indiction. The next or the 11 Ahau would commence in the
    year 10 Cauac, which combination in its rotation would happen after a
    lapse of twenty-four years. The third or 9 Ahau would begin in 8 Cauac
    twenty-four years later, in illustration of which we follow out the
    rotation of the four names of the years, Kan, Muluc, Ix and Cauac,
    through the indictions of thirteen years each, until we have noted the
    numerals accompanying them during twenty-four years. Our starting point
    will be the commencement of the second Ahau Katun on the second day of
    10 Cauac.</p>

  <p>As above stated the new Ahau Katun begins in the year 8 Cauac, and as
    it invariably began on the second day of the year, that day would be
    9 Ahau, as Ahau is the next letter in the alphabet after Cauac. An
    extension of the table will show that the next period will begin in 6
    Cauac on 7 Ahau, and so on in the order of the numerals given above.
    Thirteen Ahau Katunes, as previously stated, constituted a great cycle
    of three hundred and twelve years. Sr. Perez states that according to
    all sources of information, confirmed by the testimony of Don Cosme de
    Burgos, one of the conquerors and a writer (but whose observations have
    been lost), the year 1392 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> corresponded to the Maya year
    7 Cauac, and as the second day of that year was the beginning of an era
    of twenty-four years, it must have been 8 Ahau Katun. By dividing off
    the time between that date and the beginning of the present century
    into periods of twenty-four years each, and extending a table of the
    rotation of the four names of the years, the reader will observe
    that 13 Ahau will fall in the year 1800; 11 Ahau in 1824; 9 Ahau in
    1848; 7 Ahau in 1872, and 5 Ahau in 1896, three hundred and twelve
    years intervening before this, and any similar combination of Ahau
    Katunes either have occurred or can be repeated. This would be highly
    satisfactory if Sr. Perez could be relied upon in this particular,
    which is doubtful. We are sorry to say that he is certainly chargeable
    with inaccuracies, which impair the value of his whole system. Most
    conspicuous of these is one pointed out by Mr. Bancroft, to which we
    refer the reader below. Señor Perez sets about the verification of his
    system by citing the death of a notable personage named Ahpula. He
    states that Ahpula died in the sixth year of 13 Ahau, when the first
    day of the year was 4 Kan, on the day 9 Imix, the eighteenth of the
    month Zip. It is seen that 13 Ahau is the second day of the year 12
    Cauac which falls in the year 1488, also that the year 1493 is the
    sixth from the beginning of 13 Ahau, and that its first day is 4 Kan,
    which is the title of the year. The day is the eighteenth of the month
    Zip, corresponding to the eleventh of September. The statement is also
    made that this date fell on 9 Imix. This is tested as follows:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span> The
    first month of that year commenced on 4 Kan, which combination names
    the year. The number (of the week of thirteen days) is found by adding
    seven to the number of the first day of each month successively. The
    number of the first day of the first month, Pop, in this case being 4,
    the number of the first day of the second month (Uo) would be 4 + 7 =
    11, and that of the first day of the third month (Zip) would be 11 + 7
    = 18, but as the week consists of but thirteen days, that number must
    be substracted, leaving 5 Kan as the first day of Zip. If Zip begins on
    the twenty-fifth of August, the day 9 Imix will be found to correspond
    both with the eighteenth of Zip and the eleventh of September, if the
    Katun week of thirteen days is counted off regularly, beginning with 5
    Kan. Sr. Perez is correct enough in his calculations, but unfortunately
    his system of twenty-four years to the Ahau Katun or his informant
    as to the correspondence of the Ahau Katunes with our chronology (no
    doubt the latter) is incorrect, since the Maya manuscript furnished
    and translated by Perez and published in the works of Stephens and
    Landa, states explicitly that Ahpula died in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1536,
    instead of 1493 (incorrectly printed 1403 in Bancroft’s work), a
    date which is irreconcilable with the system of twenty-four years to
    the Ahau, reckoned from 1392 as a starting point. Neither will the
    statement of Landa that the year 1541 corresponded with the beginning
    of 11 Ahau relieve the difficulty, but rather increases it, since it
    will neither harmonize with the date of Ahpula’s death given in the
    MS. nor with the system by Perez. Furthermore, while Landa gives the
    same succession of numerals for the recurrence of the Ahaus, he states
    that they embraced but twenty years each, thus making it impossible
    for the combinations of names and numerals to correspond to the order
    which he lays down for their succession. Landa is no doubt incorrect
    in his statement. Sr. Perez is at least consistent in his adaptation
    of the length of the Ahau Katun to the order of numerals given by
    Landa and others. Recently, M. Delaporte, a member of the Société
    Américaine de France, has, by a series of extended calculations,
    vindicated the correctness of the statement of Sr. Perez,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span> that the
    Ahau Katun embraced twenty-four years. M. de Rosny agrees with M.
    Delaporte in his conclusions. The fault of Perez, probably, lies in
    his adaptation of the Ahaus to our chronology, and in carelessness.
    Amidst these discrepancies it is impossible to fix accurately the
    dates of the Maya history, though they can be approximated.<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Señor
    Perez cites Boturini as stating that the day introduced every four
    years to compensate for the annual loss of six hours, was observed by
    counting the symbol for the three hundred and sixty-fifth day twice,
    as the Romans did with their bissextile days, thus leaving the order
    undisturbed.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

  <p><i>The Nahua Calendar</i> system closely resembles that of the Mayas, a
    fact which adds to the abundant proof that both civilizations had grown
    up under nearly the same influences, and that they had largely affected
    each other. If the trifling differences of a few writers concerning
    some of the details of the Aztec calendar be overlooked, and the best
    authorities (together with a little exercise of judgment) be followed,
    the system becomes comparatively simple. Sahagun, Leon y Gama,

  <p><i>The Mexican Calendar</i> contains divisions as follows: The age,
    called <i>huehuetiliztli</i>, embraced two cycles of fifty-two years
    each, thus equalizing one hundred and four years. The cycle of
    fifty-two years was named <i>xiuhmolpilli</i>, <i>xiuhmolpia</i>,
    and <i>xiuhtlalpilli</i>, signifying the “binding up of the years”
    and consisted of four periods of thirteen years each. These periods
    or indictions were called “knots,” while the single years were
    called <i>xihuitl</i> or “new grass,” because anciently, before the
    invention of the calendar, the Nahuas were only able to distinguish the
    revolution of the years by the annual appearance of fresh vegetation
    and new grass. The age was but little used, the cycle being the common
    measure for long periods. The years in a given cycle were designated
    as among the Mayas, by means of the consecutive rotation of four
    signs, each accompanied with a numeral. The signs were <i>tochtli</i>,
    “rabbit”; <i>acatl</i>, “cane”; <i>tecpatl</i>, “flint,” and
    <i>calli</i>, “house.” The following table illustrates the rotation
    occurring in one cycle:</p>

  <p>As in the Maya rotation of years no confusion could occur, so with the
    Mexican, as the same combination could be made only once in fifty-two
    years. The cycles themselves were distinguished by numbers. Confusion
    is liable to arise in studying the early writers, since the Toltecs
    and Aztecs began their reckoning on different signs, the former on
    Tecpatl, and the latter on Tochtli. The year consisted of eighteen
    months of twenty days each, to which were added five days called
    <i>nemontemi</i> or “unlucky days.” Every superstition seemed to centre
    in the <i>nemontemi</i>, for no business of importance nor enterprise
    of the most insignificant character would be undertaken upon these
    days. Both the names of the months and the particular month which
    served to begin the year, as well as the date of the first day of the
    year, have been fruitful subjects of controversy between authors. Mr.
    Bancroft has tabulated the names given by twenty-one writers, and shown
    the disagreements existing between them.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> The dates for the first
    day of the year range between the ninth of January and the tenth of
    April. Gama, Humboldt and Gallatin, by careful calculations, have shown
    that the first year of a Nahua cycle commenced on the thirty-first day
    of December, old style, or on the ninth day of January, new style, with
    the month Titill and the day Cipactli.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

  <p>The names and order of the months, together with their etymologies,
    as adopted by Mr. Bancroft, are as follows: 1. Titill, meaning “our
    mother,” according to Boturini, or “fire,” according to Cabrera; 2.
    Itzcalli, translated “regeneration” by Boturini, “skill” by the Codex
    Vaticanus, and the “sprouting of the grass” by Veytia; 3. Atlcahualco,
    meaning the “abating of the waters.” Another name (Quahuillehua)
    applied to this month signified “burning of the mountains,” referring
    to the forests; 4. Tlacaxipehualiztli, is translated “the flaying of
    the people.” Another name applied to this month, Cohuailhuitl, means
    the “feast of the snake”; 5. Tozoztontli is rendered “small fast”
    or “penance”; 6. Hueytozoztli, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>means “great fast” or “penance”; 7.
    Toxcatl, a “necklace”; 8. Etzalqualiztli, “bean stew” or “maize gruel”;
    9. Tecuilhuitzintli, “small feast of the Lord”; 10. Hueytecuilhuitl,
    “great feast of the Lord”; 11. Miccailhuitzintli, translated “small
    feast of the dead”; 12. Hueymiccailhuitl, “great feast of the
    dead”; 13. Ochpaniztli, “cleaning of the streets”; 14. Teotleco,
    “arrival of the gods.” The names Pachtli, “moss hanging from trees,”
    and Pachtontli, “humiliation,” were often applied to this month;
    15. Hueypachtli, “great feast of humiliation,” sometimes called
    Tepeilhuitl, “feast of the mountains”; 16. Quecholli, “peacock”; 17.
    Panquetzuliztli, “the raising of flags and banners”; 18. Atemoztli,
    means the “drying up of the waters.”</p>

  <p>The month, consisting of twenty days, was divided into four weeks
    of five days each. Mr. Bancroft states that each of the weeks began
    with one of the four signs—Tochtli, Calli, Tecpatl or Acatl, used
    to designate the years; but his own engraving of the Aztec month,
    and the order of the days on the Calendar-Stone, contradict this
    statement.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> The following are the days in their proper order, with
    their translations affixed: 1. Cipactli, “sea-animal,” “sword-fish,”
    or “serpent with harpoons.” 2. Ehacatl, “wind.” 3. Calli, “house.” 4.
    Cuetzpalin, “lizard.” 5. Coatl, “snake.” 6. Miquiztli, “death.” 7.
    Mazatl, “deer.” 8. Tochtli, “rabbit.” 9. Atl, “water.” 10. Itzcuintli,
    “dog.” 11. Ozomatli, “monkey.” 12. Mollinalli, “brushwood” or “tangled
    grass.” 13. Acatl, “cane.” 14. Ocelotl, “tiger.” 15. Quanhtli, “eagle.”
    16. Cozcaquauhtli, “vulture.” 17. Ollin, “movement.” 18. Tecpatl,
    “flint.” 19. Quahuitl, “rain.” 20. Xochitl, “flower.”</p>

  <p>The day was divided into sixteen hours.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Sahagun and several
    authors state that the loss of six hours in each Aztec year was
    counterbalanced by the addition of a day every four years. Gama
    demonstrates this to be a mistake, and states that they added twelve
    and a half days at the close of every cycle of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>fifty-two years. Mr.
    Bancroft cites this fact, and states the time added to have been
    thirteen days.<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

  <p>The Nahuas had also a ritual calendar, for the purpose of reckoning
    their religious feasts, which was altogether different from the civil
    system, except that it employed the twenty days, the year of 365
    days, and at the end of a cycle added the thirteen days to compensate
    for the time lost during that period.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> The year consisted of two
    parts, the first composed of twenty weeks of thirteen days each (for
    there were no months in the ritual year) making 260 altogether. This
    portion of the year was called <i>Meztli pohualli</i> or the “lunar
    computation,” from the fact that half of the time during which the
    moon is visible is thirteen days. The smaller part, composed of 105
    days reckoned by a continuation of the periods of thirteen days, was
    called <i>Toualpohualli</i> or “solar computation.”<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> The days were
    numbered from one up to thirteen, the fourteenth day of the first solar
    month being counted the first of another lunar week, and thus the
    reckoning continued. However, it will be observed that the same number
    would fall twice on one name in the course of a year; accordingly
    accompanying signs were provided for the regular names of days. The
    duplication could not occur if the second division embraced 104 days
    instead of 105.</p>

  <p>The distinguishing signs were nine in number, called <i>quecholli</i>,
    “lords of the night.” They were as follows: Tletl, “fire”; Tecpatl,
    “flint”; Xochitl, “flower”; Centeotl, “goddess of maize”; Miquiztli,
    “death”; Atl, “water”; Tlazolteotl, “goddess of love”; Tepeyollotli, “a
    mountain deity”; Quiahuitl, “rain,” the god Tlaloc. The lords of the
    night, though reckoned from the first of the year, were not mentioned
    except in connection with the 105 days of the second division.</p>

  <p>The reader will more clearly understand the relation of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>two
    systems to each other by constructing a table of four parallel columns.
    In the left-hand column place the months of one year, numbering the
    days of each month in order, but beginning on the ninth day of January.
    In the second column place the names of the Mexican months, numbering
    the days of each month from one to twenty in regular order. In the
    third column place the <em>names</em> of the Mexican days, twenty in
    number, repeating them in their regular rotation throughout the year,
    but in addition prefix to the names such numerals as will fall opposite
    to each in the process of dividing them off into thirteens. These
    divisions into thirteens represent the ritual weeks. Acatl being the
    13th day of the month will end the first week of the year, and Ocelotl
    being the 14th day of the month will constitute the 1st day of the
    second week. In the fourth column place the nine signs of the “lords
    of the night” in regular order. Divide the year into periods of nines,
    and it will be found that the same combination of days of the month
    (twenty days), of days of the week (thirteen days), and the “lords of
    the night,” will not recur for a considerable period.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable embodiment of this complex system is found in the
    symbols and concentric zones graven upon the face of the Calendar
    Stone, described in the last chapter. The interpretation of its
    mysterious disk was partly accomplished by the learned antiquarian Leon
    y Gama; Gallatin, and after him Bancroft presented those investigations
    to the public. In 1875 (Nov.), Don Alfredo Chevero, of the Liceo
    Hidalgo of Mexico, published his <cite>Calendario Azteca</cite>, in which
    it was shown that many of Gama’s interpretations would have to be
    abandoned. It was proven that the “Calendar Stone” was a sun-disk or
    stone of sacrifice, and that Gama had pursued his investigations with
    a mistaken view of its character. Chevero’s account of the history of
    the stone is full and satisfactory, Duran being the authority cited. An
    interpretation of some of the concentric zones, two in particular, is
    attempted with a result somewhat different from that obtained by any
    other investigator. Recently, Prof. Ph. Valentini, by the light of his
    extensive researches into Nahua literature, has compelled the sun-disk
    to give up its secrets. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span> illustration on the preceding page is a
    reproduction of a pen-and-ink drawing made by the Professor from the
    most recent and correct photograph which has been made of the Calendar
    Stone. It was kindly furnished for this work. The same conclusion
    concerning the character of the stone was reached independently by
    both Chevero and Valentini. The latter’s account of the stone and
    its history is drawn from Tezozomoc, and though agreeing in the main
    facts with Duran’s account as rendered by Chevero, bears the evidence
    upon its face of independent research.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> The originality of Prof.
    Valentini is vindicated in his masterly interpretation of all the zones
    of the Calendar Stone. Whether the interpretation will ever give way to
    some other is a question of the future, though it is probable that it
    will not.</p>

  <p>We are indebted to Professor Valentini for a communication on the
    History of the Calendar Stone, condensed from his unpublished MS.
    <cite>Description and Interpretation of the Mexican Calendar Stone</cite>.
    An extract from the communication is as follows: “King Axayacatl of
    Mexico, 1466–1480, the builder of the large pyramid, at the approach
    of the last year of the national cycle (1479), ordered the altar
    standing on the platform of the pyramid to be covered with a stone
    disk, the surface of which was to be sculptured with the image of the
    Sun-god, and, as the text says, ‘to be surrounded by all the national
    deities’ (see Alvaro de Tezozomoc, 1598, <cite>Chronica Mexicana</cite>,
    Ternaux-Compans, vol. i, chap. xlvii, pp. 249 <i>et seq.</i>). A large
    slab, carried for the purpose from the quarries of Cuyoacan, when
    rolled over the bridge of Xoloc, crushed this structure, fell to the
    bottom of the lake and remained there. Another slab was broken and a
    new bridge built, and 50,000 Indians succeeded in transporting the
    slab to the foot of the pyramid, where the sculptor accomplished his
    task to the satisfaction of the king. The cyclical festival of the sun
    (1479) was celebrated, and on the disk which now had been inserted
    into the surface of the sacrificial altar, thousands of captives were
    slaughtered. The king is said to have overworked <span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>himself, slaying one
    hundred of the victims, and feasting upon their flesh and blood—that
    very soon after he died in consequence of these exertions. In the year
    1512, Montezuma II, for reasons unknown, expressed the wish to replace
    the altar cover, which his father had consecrated, by a new and still
    larger one. The people, horrified and out of patience with the bloody
    proceedings connected with these consecration festivals of sacrificial
    disks, contrived to let the slab, brought expressly for the purpose,
    fall into the lake again, pretending as an excuse, that the stone
    had spoken and said that it was to go back to the quarry. Montezuma,
    superstitious as he was, took the accident for a bad augury, desisted
    from his plan, and left the stone in its place. We may thus infer that
    it was <em>our</em> disk on which, in the year 1520, those Spaniards
    of Cortes’ troops which were made captives had been immolated, and
    the screams and cries of whom reached the ears of their comrades, and
    as Bernal Diaz narrates, ‘filled their hearts with the most awful
    forebodings.’ Cortez demolished the pyramid, and with its débris filled
    the canals of the city. The disk was preserved, for we know from Duran,
    who wrote a <cite>Historia de la N. España</cite>, 1588, that he and many of
    his fellow-citizens had often been standing before this disk admiring
    it, until the Archbishop Montufar, scandalized by the existence of such
    a barbarous relic, caused it to be buried in the immediate neighborhood
    of the Metropolitan cathedral in the year 1551. This procedure was
    forgotten; so much so, that when this disk was disinterred in the year
    1790, even Gama the archæologist and its later interpreter, had not the
    remotest idea what purpose it could have served, for the manuscript
    chronicles of Duran and Tezozomoc still slumbered in the dust of the
    archives. The viceroy, Reviellagigedo, ordered the disk to be fitted
    into the outer wall of one of the towers of the cathedral. There it is
    to this day.”</p>

  <p>We now ask your attention to the stone itself. The central circle
    contains the face of the Sun-god bedecked with ornaments, earrings,
    and jeweled lip. In the next zone we observe four large parallelograms
    containing hieroglyphic signs: Nahui Ocelotl, Nahui Ehecatl, Nahui
    Quahuitl and Nahui Atl. Between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span> upper and lower enclosures on both
    sides of the central disk are circular figures containing hieroglyphics
    resembling claws, said to represent two ancient astrologers, man and
    wife, who, according to the early writers, invented the calendar.
    These four signs are identical with the days on which, according to
    the traditions, the world was destroyed at four different times.
    These destructions mark four ages represented by the signs of the day
    on which they occurred. These ages were also called suns. The first
    destruction occurred in Ce Acatl, and is represented by the sign
    Nahui Ocelotl, or 4 Tigre, seen in the upper right-hand tablet. The
    small figure above and towards the left is the sign for 1. Tecpatl, a
    feast-day kept by the Aztecs in memory of the first destruction. The
    second tablet bears the symbol for Ehecatl or Wind, in memory of the
    destruction of the world by hurricane, which occurred in the year Ce
    Tecpatl or Nahui (4) Ehecatl. Between the tablet and the triangular
    figure to the right is a sculpture in which a broken wall with
    towers appears. The sign 1. Calli is associated with it, indicating
    a ritualistic feast-day kept on that sign. The third tablet bears
    the symbol of the rain-god Tlaloc, in memory of the destruction of
    the world from frequent rains. The last tablet represents the fourth
    destruction by a flood on Nahui Atl in the year Ce Calli.</p>

  <p>The faces of Cox-Cox, the Mexican Noah, and his wife are delineated in
    the picture. The symbol for water is seen immediately below the faces.
    Between the two lower tablets, two small quadrilateral enclosures will
    be observed, each containing five round points, supposed to mean 10
    Ollin (the sun being called <i>ollin tonatiuh</i>). Below the lower
    tablets and almost in contact with the next concentric circle are the
    hieroglyphics 1. Quiahuitl and 2. Ozomatli. The first, namely 10 Ollin,
    corresponds with our twenty-second of September in the first year of
    a cycle, and its hieroglyphic on this astronomical disk represents
    the autumnal equinox. At the extreme top of the Calendar Stone is a
    central figure, well known to be the hieroglyphic for 13 Acatl. This
    fact known, the interpretation of the two remaining symbols is easy.
    In the year 13 Acatl, the day 1. Quiahuitl would correspond to our
    twenty-second of March,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span> and represent the vernal equinox. In the same
    year 2. Ozomatli would correspond with our twenty-second of June, or
    summer solstice. Thus it is that the stone speaks and testifies to
    the astronomical knowledge of the Aztecs, the accuracy of which casts
    into the shade the imperfect Julian Calendar in use by Europeans at
    the time of the conquest. In the next zone, encircling that which
    contains the tablets of the cosmological ages, are twenty enclosures,
    containing the symbols of the twenty days. The triangular pointer
    which extends upwards from the crest of the sun-face indicates the
    dividing line between the first and last days of the month. Cipactli,
    whose hieroglyphic stands at the left of the pointer is unquestionably
    distinguished as the first day of the month. The second symbol to the
    left is that of the second day Ehecatl, wind, the third Calli, house,
    the fourth Cuetzpalin, lizard, the fifth snake, and so on to the end
    of the list. In the next zone we find a succession of small squares,
    each enclosing five round points. The circle is divided into four parts
    by four large triangular pointers or gnomons. In each division of the
    zone are ten squares containing five points each, or in the four,
    we have 200 points. Gama states that the space for sixty additional
    points is occupied by the feet or curves of the large indices. By
    experiment it is found that the mean of the space occupied by the
    feet of the pointers is equal to the width of one and a half of the
    square enclosures. Eight times this space gives us twelve squares with
    sixty points. Thus we have the ritualistic division or lunar reckoning
    (Metzli pohualli) of 260 days. In the next zone the symbols of the
    remaining 105 days or solar reckoning of the ritualistic year is found.
    Eight pointers divide the circle; the six upper divisions of which
    contain each ten figures resembling a grain of maize, while the two
    lower divisions have but five figures in each. This gives us seventy
    figures. Under each limb of the pointers is space for one and a half of
    the figures, giving twenty-four more or ninety-four in all. The space
    of ten additional figures is occupied by the helm-plumes of the heads
    which are figured at the lower margin of the stone. This gives us 104
    figures, or one less than the required number. It will be remembered
    that the five intercalary days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span> called the nemontemi, or unlucky
    days, though reckoned in regular order at the close of each year,
    were considered separate and apart from it. The artist who executed
    the Calendar Stone has carried out this custom in placing the figures
    of the nemontemi between the tablets of the two last destructions of
    nature, where they will be found by themselves. It will be observed
    that four of the signs correspond to those wanting under the lower
    pointer and the adjacent plumes, with this further departure from the
    general plan of the design, that the central figure or maize grain
    corresponds to the space between the limbs of the great pointer below.
    Here, then, we have the missing symbol, and are able to find the 105
    hieroglyphics of days for the lesser division of the year. The two
    zones consequently represent the complete year of 365 days.</p>

  <p>The most conspicuous of the remaining zones is the outer, and last of
    all. The attention is asked to one of the twenty-four quadrangular
    figures composing it. The Mexican Codices in the Kingsborough
    collection furnish similar symbols for the cycle of 52 years.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> The
    ancient Mexicans had a superstition that in the last night of the 52d
    year of their cycle the sun would destroy the world. Consequently, at
    every recurrence of the eventful night, all fires were extinguished,
    the people clothed themselves in mourning, and forming a long
    procession, repaired to a neighboring mountain, where at midnight a
    priest sacrificed a man in their presence. A second priest placed a
    round block of dry wood over the ghastly wound from which the heart
    had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>been torn; while a third, kneeling over the corpse, rested a hard
    shaft or stick upon the block, revolving it between his two hands
    with pressure until the friction produced fire. This was considered
    a promise from the god that the destruction of the world would be
    postponed until another cycle had elapsed.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> A moment’s observation
    will disclose the fire symbol in the hieroglyphics for the cycle
    as delineated on the stone; the perpendicular shaft with handles,
    surrounded by flames and smoke, rising from a hole below. In the same
    zone, above, we have two groups of pleats or bow-like figures, which
    are clearly proven to be the symbol for the binding of two 52-year
    cycles into an age.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

  <p>The zone immediately within the one we have been considering, contains
    the symbols of the rain-god Tlaloc. No writer has as yet given a
    satisfactory explanation of the plumed head at the bottom of the stone.
    It will be readily seen that the two serpent heads, plumed, and with
    extended jaws, armed above and below with great fangs, enclose two
    human faces. These are but the heads of the serpents whose bodies
    constitute the outer zone of the disk and terminate in the triangular
    points above.</p>

  <p>If the reader will but turn to our cut of the serpent temple at Uxmal
    (p. 394), the same symbol of Cukulcan or Quetzalcoatl, the feathered
    serpent, will be seen. Dr. Le Plongeon, in his recent researches, is
    convinced that Uxmal was built, or more properly rebuilt, by Nahua
    invaders, who afterwards became amalgamated with the Mayas.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Most
    of the Mexican historians represent Quetzalcoatl as the founder of
    the Nahua civilization. Torquemada states that he was their leader
    when they first arrived in Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> If the “Feathered Serpent”
    was the founder <span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>of their institutions, it was not inappropriate for
    the Aztec artist to place the hero’s face at the bottom of the stone,
    and represent the symbols of the cycles as huge scales upon his body,
    since the influence of the civilization which he established had been
    felt throughout their entire history. To return to Prof. Valentini’s
    investigations, it will be observed that there are twenty-four of the
    cycle symbols, two of which are nearly hidden under the helm-plumes.
    The product of 24 and 52 gives us a period of 1248 years. But what have
    we to do with this result? The triangular-shaped figures which point to
    the central tablet cut at the top of the stone, indicate that we must
    make a calculation, and it remains for us to interpret that symbol. It
    is recognizable as the sign Acatl accompanied by the number thirteen; a
    year which, according to the authentic tables of reduction, corresponds
    to the year 1479 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; a date which is confirmed as being the
    year in which the Calendar Stone was finished and set up in the great
    pyramid of Mexico by the statement of the native writer Tezozomoc,
    that its author, King Axayacatl, became ill from his exertions at the
    tragic celebrations of the completion of the temple and lived scarcely
    a year, at the same time fixing the date of his death in 1480. If we
    subtract 1248 years from the known date 1479 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, we have
    the year 231 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; a date which no doubt marks the beginning
    of the national era of the Nahuas, and probably designates the year of
    their arrival in Mexico by the ports of Tampico, Xicalanco and Bacalar.
    Thus it is that the uncertainty of the traditions relating to the
    obscure events of early Nahua history is removed, and we are enabled to
    settle upon the third century of our era as the period when the great
    migration took place. We will say more than Professor Valentini or his
    predecessor; we believe this to be the date of the migration from Hue
    hue Tlapalan, the country of the Mound-builders of the Mississippi
    valley, and we further think we are sustained in this view both by the
    early writers and by the condition of the mounds and shell-heaps of the
    United States. At first thought, it would seem that the year 231 might
    be the date in which the astrologers assembled in Hue hue Tlapalan for
    the correction of the calendar (a fact to which we have previously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
    referred), but it is distinctly stated that the assembly convened in
    the year 1 Tecpatl; a date which, according to the received reduction
    tables, corresponds to the year 29 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span></p>

  <p>Humboldt by an elaborate discussion has satisfactorily shown the
    relative likeness of the Nahua Calendar to that of Asia. He cites the
    fact that the Chinese, Japanese, Calmouks, Mongols, Mantchoux and
    other hordes of Tartars have cycles of sixty years duration, divided
    into five brief periods of twelve years each. The method of citing
    a date by means of signs and numbers is quite similar with Asiatics
    and Mexicans.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> He further shows satisfactorily that the majority
    of the names of the twenty days employed by the Aztecs are those of
    a zodiac used since the most remote antiquity among the peoples of
    Eastern Asia.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Cabrera thinks he finds analogies between the
    Mexican and Egyptian calendars. Adopting the view of several writers
    (Acosta, Clavigero and others) that the Mexican year began on the 26th
    of February, he finds the date to correspond to the beginning of the
    Egyptian year. He also observes that both peoples intercalated five
    days at the close of their year.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> M. Jomard, quoted by Delafield,
    denies that the Egyptians intercalated, but believes sufficient
    analogies exist to prove a common origin for the Theban and Mexican
    calendars;<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> his argument, however, is worthless, as are many others
    of a similar character.</p>

  <p><i>Religious Analogies.</i>—In contrast with the obscure subject of the
    calendar requiring such close attention, we present to the reader a few
    of the analogies supposed to exist between Mexican and other religious
    systems. The majority of our references will be made more with a
    view to satisfying curiosity than for the establishment of a theory.
    Argument from analogy is at best unscientific—it proves nothing. It
    is a matter of surprise how much has been written to establish the
    theory that the Mexicans <span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>were descendants of the Jews both in race
    and religion. Mr. Bancroft has collected many of Lord Kingsborough’s
    arguments in proof of the theory to which he devoted his fortune and
    sacrificed his life. We have done a similar work with a somewhat
    different arrangement, and call the attention of the reader to some of
    the fanciful and we must add mirth-provoking analogies to which the
    great Americanist attached so much importance. “The Mexicans spoke
    of their god as the <em>invisible and incorporeal Unity</em>, and they
    furthermore believed man to be created in his image.”<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> He states
    further that the doctrine of the trinity was also held by them.<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> He
    considers that Eden and the temptation were portrayed by the American
    artists. “The Toltecs had paintings of a garden with a single tree
    standing in the midst, one especially drawn on coarse paper of the
    Aloe, round the root of which tree is entwined a serpent, whose head
    appearing above the foliage displays the features and countenance of a
    woman. * * * Torquemada admits the existence of this tradition amongst
    them, and agrees with the Indian historians who affirm this was the
    first woman in the world who had children, and from whom all mankind
    are descended.”<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>

  <p>Lord Kingsborough is no doubt warranted in holding that the Nahuas
    were of old world origin at a very remote period prior to their having
    developed any special tribal characteristics, because of their singular
    and we think certain knowledge of the Mosaic deluge; but he is not
    justified in claiming for them any particular relationship to the
    Jewish or any Shemitic people.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span></p>

  <p>In a preceding chapter we have given the deluge tradition from
    Ixtlilxochitl, who states that the waters rose <em>fifteen cubits</em>
    (caxtolmoletltli) above the highest mountains, and that a few escaped
    in a close chest (toptlipetlacali), and after men had multiplied, they
    erected a very high <i>zacuali</i> or tower, in order to take refuge
    in it should the world be again destroyed. He further states that then
    their speech was confused, so that they could not understand each
    other, and that they dispersed to different parts of the earth.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>
    Whether the native historian of Tezcuco who gives us this account,
    so remarkable for its similarity to the Mosaic, was influenced by
    Spanish priests and warped from the truth, we are not prepared to
    affirm at this distant day, since such an assumption would strike the
    very keystone from the arch upon which all historical evidence rests.
    Much of the aversion to the view that the Mexican deluge legends
    are authentic and of old world origin, has been generated by the
    unscientific and presumptuous style of most of its advocates. Lord
    Kingsborough himself is ever ready to catch at a straw, and out of
    customs the most remote to evolve an analogy. Nevertheless, we are
    not at liberty to reject the Mexican deluge legend as a fable without
    assuming the burden of proof.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> Remarkable parallels (?) in the
    history of both Jews and Mexicans are thought to be discovered by
    the sanguine Kingsborough. Of a number, two or three specimens will
    suffice. Hue hue Tlapalan is claimed to have been situated on the
    Californian coast since the Gulf of California until a late period was
    called the <i>red river</i> or <i>gulf</i>, a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>name they brought with
    them.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> Again: “As the Israelites were conducted from Egypt by Moses
    and Aaron who were accompanied by their sister Miriam, so the Aztecs
    departed from Aztlan under the guidance of Huitziton and Tecpalzin, the
    former of whom is named by Acosta and Herrera, Mixi, attended likewise
    by their sister Quilaztli, or as she is otherwise named Chimalman or
    Malinatli, both of which names have some resemblance to Miriam as Mixi
    has to Moses.”<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> “The destruction of the rebellious Kohra (Gen.
    xvi) is repeated after the arrival of the Mexicans at Tulan, who,
    enchanted with the land, were unwilling to go further in search of
    their promised land. They murmured at Huitzilopochtli, and suffered a
    dreadful punishment at his hands that night by the death of every one
    who had rebelled against his will.”<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

  <p>Lord Kingsborough discovers in a Mexican painting in the Bodleian
    library, a symbol resembling the jaw-bone of an ass, from the side
    of which water flows forth. This, of course, commemorated the story
    of Sampson.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> Among the conspicuous doctrines held by both Jews
    and Mexicans, we note that the latter believed their children to be
    the gift of Tezcatlipoca as the former ascribed them to the favor
    of Jehovah.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> The doctrine of sin and atonement was held by
    the Mexicans. Confession and sacrifice of atonement were common,
    for “half the offerings represented in the Mexican paintings were
    trespass-offerings, or sacrifices for the commission of sins.”<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>
    “The Mexicans, like the Jews, were accustomed to do penance by sitting
    on the ground, in which posture their priests are often represented
    in the Mexican paintings.”<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> “The Mexicans were as punctilious
    about washings and ablutions as the Jews.”<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> Baptism was considered
    the means of regeneration in Yucatan,<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> and was practised by the
    Mexicans as a religious ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> Both peoples had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>devils and the
    leprosy,<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> both considered women who died in child-bed as worthy
    of honor as soldiers who fall in battle.<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> The doctrine of hell,
    according to the most orthodox theology, was held by the Mexicans.<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>
    Both Jews and Mexicans believed in the resurrection of the body and the
    immortality of the soul.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> The latter people sprinkled the face of
    a corpse with water as a baptism after death.<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> Numerous analogies
    are found to exist between the Mosaic and the religious code of the
    Mexicans, as in profanity, sabbath-keeping, disobedience to parents,
    the smiting of a servant to death, and in the punishment by stoning of
    persons guilty of fornication and adultery.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> Kingsborough maintains
    that circumcision was performed on the eighth day, declaring it to
    have “prevailed thousands of leagues along the coast of the Atlantic,
    amongst nations very remote from each other, and who spoke very
    different languages.”<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> Both peoples had a mutual disgust for swine
    flesh, and refused to eat the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>blood of any animal.<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> The latter
    statement is altogether unwarranted in fact. The ceremonial of both
    peoples have many features in common. As the Jews killed the paschal
    lamb in the evening, so the Mexicans offered up their sacrifices at
    night.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> The Jews in Mexico substituted llamas for sheep in their
    sacrifices.<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Both Jews and Mexicans worshipped toward the east, or
    toward their chief temples, and both called the <em>south</em> by the
    designation of “right-hand of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> Both burned incense
    toward the four corners of the earth.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> As David leaped and danced
    before the ark of the Lord, so did the Mexican monarchs before their
    idols.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> Both peoples had an ark, and Duran states that in the ark
    of the Aztecs which figured so prominently in their migration, was
    the image of their invisible god.<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> Numerous analogies relating
    to astrology, omens, witchcraft, dreams, etc., are recorded.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>
    References to prophecy are not wanting: Quetzalcoatl predicted the
    destruction of the temple of Cholula, furnishing a parallel to Christ’s
    prophecy of the destruction of the temple.<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> In the Mexican
    mythology, by means of an active imagination, he finds an allusion to
    the “stone which was carved without hands.”<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> A tiger represented
    in the Bologna MS. he supposes to be the lion of the tribe of Juda—the
    Jews of the New World having metamorphosed it into a tiger.<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
    Kingsborough supposes that the crosses found in Mexico may have been
    carried there by Irish monks, “especially,” he adds, “as M. de Humboldt
    informs us that the first Spanish monks and missionaries gravely
    discussed the question of whether Quetzalcoatl was an Irishman.”<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>
    The fanaticism of the eminent Americanist, however, reaches its
    culmination in his supposed discovery of analogies to Christ in Mexican
    mythology. The story of the virgin, the annunciation, and the identity
    of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>Christ and Quetzalcoatl, are clearly discernible to his practised
    eye.<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> Christ stilled the tempest, and, like Quetzalcoatl, was god
    of the air.<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> In Yucatan, in the priestly fable of Bacab, he finds a
    complete and true account of the trinity.<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> It is hardly necessary
    for us to remark that these ingenious comparisons, tinged with a
    coloring of fanaticism and yet so full of interest, are useless to the
    cause of science and prove nothing. With the single exception of the
    remarkable tradition of the deluge and its literal correspondence in
    detail to the Mosaic account, we must dismiss the multitude of supposed
    analogies between Mexican and Hebrew traditions, customs and religion,
    which Kingsborough and others have discovered, as either imaginary or
    accidental.<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

  <p>The hypothesis that the Nahua religion may have received some of its
    characteristics from India is altogether plausible and not without
    support in resemblances. The cosmological conception of the egg and
    serpent is found, as previously stated, on Brush Creek, in Adams
    County, Ohio. It certainly comes to us from Asiatic India. Serpent
    worship, not only among the people of the mounds but especially of
    Mexico, is the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>most patent fact revealed to us in ancient American
    sculpture. “Humboldt thinks he sees in the snake cut in pieces, the
    famous serpent Kaliya or Kalinaga, conquered by Vishnu, when he took
    the form of Krishna, and in the Mexican Toua-tiuh, the Hindu Krushna,
    sung of in the Bhagavata-Purana.”<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> Count Stolberg and Tschudi have
    both made arguments in favor of this view.<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> Humboldt characterizes
    Quetzalcoatl as the Buddha of the Mexicans, the founder of the monastic
    establishments resembling those of Thibet and Western Asia.<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> He
    further considers the flood of which they speak, identical with that
    of which traditions are preserved by the Hindoos, the Chinese, and the
    Shemitic peoples.</p>

  <p>Advocates of Scandinavian analogies in religion are not wanting.
    Although Viollet-le-Duc finds parallels existing between the
    Brahmanistic ideas of divinity and passages of the <cite>Popol Vuh</cite>,
    still he is of the opinion that the strongest resemblances have been
    found to exist between the religious customs of the Scandinavians and
    those recorded in the <cite>Popol Vuh</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> Humboldt remarks, “we have
    fixed the special attention of our readers upon this Votan or Wodan,
    an American who appears of the same family with the Wods or Odins of
    the Goths and of the peoples of Celtic origin. Since, according to the
    learned researches of Sir William Jones, Odin and Buddha are probably
    the same person, it is curious to see the names of <i>Bondvar</i>,
    <i>Wodansdag</i> and <i>Votan</i> designating in India, Scandinavia,
    and in Mexico, the day of a brief period.”<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

  <p>Lafitau, in his <cite>Mœurs des Sauvages</cite>, is as enthusiastic in
    his advocacy of the theory that the ancient Americans derived their
    religion from the Greeks, as Kingsborough is certain that it was of
    Jewish origin. He devotes his fourth chapter, and furnishes numerous
    illustrations, in support of his view.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Our limited space precludes
    the possibility of presenting in full the analogies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span> discovered
    by the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg between the Mexican deities and
    those of Greece and Egypt. If we hesitate sometimes in accepting his
    conclusions, we cannot but wonder at his erudition and his zeal in
    research. He calls attention to the fact that the cult of Pan and
    Hermes were identical in Greece, and refers to Maia, a personification
    of the earth, and the mother of the Hermes having been the consort
    of Zeus or Pan himself. So in Mexico he finds Pan in the person of
    <i>Cipactoual</i>, who, under the name of <i>Cuextecatl</i>, has
    for his consort <i>Maia</i> or <i>Maiaoel</i>. This god was adored
    in all parts of Mexico and Central America, and at <i>Panuco</i> or
    <i>Panco</i>, literally <i>Panopolis</i>, the Spaniards found upon
    their entrance into Mexico, superb temples and images of Pan.<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>
    The names of both Pan and Maia enter extensively into the Maya
    vocabulary, <i>Maia</i> being the same as <i>Maya</i>, the principal
    name of the peninsula, and <i>pan</i>, making Mayapan, the ancient
    capital. In the Nahua language <i>pan</i> or <i>pani</i> signifies
    “equality to that which is above,” and <i>Pantecatl</i> was the
    progenitor of all beings. The Abbé has little difficulty in proving
    the identity of Zamna, Hunab-ku and other Maya deities, with the
    gods of Greece.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> In the name of the Egyptian god Horus, he finds
    the significance of hurricane, or in the dialects of the Antilles,
    <i>huracan</i> or <i>urogan</i>, the god Hurakan of the Quichés. Also
    in the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol which Salvolini found equivalent
    to the phonetic K, namely, the singular reptile <i>Uraeus</i>, which
    resembles a serpent in an erect position with an enlarged body, and
    employed extensively as a decoration in hair of the Egyptian deities
    and the Pharaohs; he sees the emblem of Quetzalcoatl (Ketzalcohuatl)
    the feathered-serpent, called Gukumatz in Quiché, and Kukulcan in
    Maya. The same symbol is represented on the Egyptian monuments with
    a feather rising from the serpent’s crest.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> It would be easy to
    pursue these ingenious comparisons through a number of pages, but we
    question their value in throwing any light on the subject in hand. The
    reader will find them <span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>scattered in profusion through the voluminous
    writings of the learned Abbé. It is sufficient to say that most of the
    seeming analogies between the new and old world religions cannot be
    other than accidental, since it is probable that the aborigines entered
    our continent at a very remote antiquity, long before the religions
    with which theirs have been so persistently compared, took on their
    distinctive features. If after they were separated from the rest of
    the world by seas and mountains, the Americans developed religious
    systems presenting analogies to those of other lands, it furnishes
    us but another proof of the common parentage and brotherhood of the
    race, of the universal outgoing of the human mind after the deity, and
    the sameness of mental operations and processes under the same given
    conditions.<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

  <p class="drop-cap">LANGUAGE in aboriginal America may be pronounced a mystery of mysteries
    and a Babel of Babels. Mr. Bancroft has catalogued nearly six hundred
    distinct languages, existing between northern Alaska and the Isthmus
    of Panama. Many of these, however, scarcely deserve to be called more
    than dialects; while each has its individuality, it is true that all
    have certain characteristics in common, a fact which by some has been
    considered sufficient ground for belief in the unity of the American
    race, a hypothesis which is by no means tenable. The geographical
    division and intermixture of languages, for instance, in California,
    is without a parallel elsewhere in the world. By the accidents
    attendant upon savage life, resulting from ceaseless hostilities and
    the frequent inroads of tribes upon their neighbors, a nation has often
    been scattered in fragments, and its refugees, separated into small
    bands, have taken up their residence in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span> midst of other tribes at
    localities far removed from their central home. In a generation or
    two a modification of the parent speech has been brought about by the
    surrounding influences, all of which vary in the several localities in
    which the refugees have found their new homes. New tribes thus formed,
    soon become unintelligible to their brothers, who have developed a
    dialect under different influences from theirs. When we consider that
    for thousands of years this wholesale division and subdivision of
    tribes and languages has been going on, as the result of ceaseless
    hostilities, we can easily account for the multitude of languages
    and dialects on the one hand, and the existence of a thread of unity
    or similarity on the other, said to run through them all. Supposing
    the continent to have received its population from several different
    quarters, the natural expectation would be that in the course of time
    this process of general intermixture would result in developing in
    each language much that was common to the others—hence the foundation
    for the hypothesis of their unity of origin. In the study of American
    languages it has often been a matter of surprise that their structure
    and expressiveness indicates a degree of perfection far in advance of
    the civilization out of which they had sprung. This superiority, we
    think, can be accounted for on the principle, first, that the evolution
    of languages on this continent has been more active and constant
    here than elsewhere, though unfortunately not always operating under
    favorable conditions; and second, that in the frequent catastrophes
    which have resulted from inter-tribal warfare, even in language, the
    law of the survival of the fittest is apparent, in the preservation
    of those etymological forms and principles of structure which are
    most useful. We by no means agree with the eminent philologist Dr.
    W. Farrar, F.R.S., chaplain to the Queen, and others who, taking
    but a partial and second-hand view of American languages, pronounce
    their elaborateness a childish excess, and their vaunted wealth a
    concealment of their poverty.<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> An examination of the poems of
    Nezahualcoyotl, king of Tezcuco, recorded by Ixtlilxochitl, will afford
    sufficient <span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>proof of the expressiveness and richness of the Aztec
    language.<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> The song on the “Mutability of Life” and the ode on the
    tyrant Tezozomoc have often been translated and admired.<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> One of
    the leading characteristics of American language, it has been said,
    is “<i>agglutination</i>,” but we must add that the term employed is
    not sufficiently comprehensive. “Agglutination,” says Farrar, “may be
    described as that principle of linguistic structure which consists
    in the mere placing of unaltered roots side by side; as when to
    express ‘discipline’ the Chinese say ‘law-soldier,’ or for ‘elders’
    ‘father-mother,’ or for ‘enjoyment’ ‘luxury-play-food-clothes.’”<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

  <p>The term <em>polysynthesis</em>, the synthesis of many words into
    one, with a little explanation will describe the characteristic, so
    prominent, to which we allude. In their polysynthesis, the syllables or
    words which are compressed into one long word, no longer retain their
    individual forms, but are clipped and altered so as to be scarcely
    recognizable. A sentence by this process of fusion is compressed into
    a single long word. Dr. Farrar cites the following example from the
    Aztec: <i>achichillacachocan</i>, means “the place where people weep
    because the water is red.” The component parts are: <i>atl</i> “water,”
    <i>chichiltic</i> “red,” <i>tlacatl</i> “man,” <i>chorea</i> “weep,”
    all of which have nearly lost their identity in the inflection and
    contraction necessary in the synthesis.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> As in the Aryan and other
    families, Grimm’s system of <i>Lautverschiebung</i>—sound changing, or
    shunting—better known by Prof. Max Müller’s designation as “Grimm’s
    law” prevails, so there are groups or families in northern Mexico
    pointed out by Buschmann to which this law is clearly applicable.
    No doubt the number of relationships already established between
    aboriginal languages, as the result of classification, will be greatly
    augmented when, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>if ever, the subject receives special attention.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>
    Mr. Bancroft classifies the languages in his catalogue under three
    great families, namely, the Tinneh, Aztec and Maya. The first, which
    covers the territory around the northern extremity of the Rocky
    Mountains, and sends its offshoots as far south as northern Mexico,
    only concerns us incidentally in treating the ancient languages of
    North America.<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> The two families (and their far-reaching branches)
    in which we are interested, are the Maya and the Aztec, the latter the
    survivor of the speech of the Nahuas.</p>

  <p>To the Maya, or rather, the Maya-Quiché stock, no doubt belongs the
    greatest antiquity assignable to any language or languages on the
    continent. The mother tongue, the Maya, prevails throughout all of
    Yucatan, and together with its dialects extends itself over Tabasco,
    Chiapas and Guatemala, and is even present in the states of Tamaulipas
    and Vera Cruz, in the Huastic and Totonac languages. Numerous
    catalogues of the branches of this family have been made, but the most
    recent, and we think the most complete, is one constructed in 1876 on
    Señor Pimentel’s classification by the Mexican scholar, Señor Garcia y
    Cubas. It is as follows: 1. Yucateco or Maya; 2. Punctunc; 3. Lacandon
    or Xochinel; 4. Peten or Itzae; 5. Chañabal, Comiteco, Jocolobal; 6.
    Chol or Mopan; 7. Chorti or Chorte. 8. Cakchi, Caichi, Cachi or Cakgi;
    9. Ixil, Izil; 10. Coxoh; 11. Quiché, Utlatec; 12. Zutuhil, Zutugil,
    Atiteca, Zacapula; 13. Cachiquel, Cachiquil; 14. Tzotzil, Zotzil,
    Tzinanteco, Cinanteco; 15. Tzendal, Zendal; 16. Mame, Mem, Zaklohpakap;
    17. Poconchi, Pocoman; 18. Atche, Atchi; 19. Huastic, and probably
    20. the Haytian, Quizqueja or Itis, with their affinities, the Cuban,
    Boriguan and Jamaican languages.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span></p>

  <p>The author of the above list has compensated us for its length by
    giving each of the names with its variation in orthography according
    to different writers. The classification is altogether superior to any
    other. The Maya is of peculiar interest to us, especially since within
    the territory over which it extends are found the most celebrated
    architectural remains known to Central American archæology. The
    majority of the sculptured tablets which are preserved are no doubt
    in the Maya or some of its dialects. What is most satisfactory to us,
    is the probability that the language is spoken to-day by the mass of
    the native population of Yucatan as it was anciently, for says Señor
    Pimentel, “the Indians have preserved this idiom with such tenacity
    that to this day they will speak no other,” and he adds that it is
    necessary for the whites to address them in their own tongue in order
    to communicate with them.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

  <p>Señor Orozco y Berra furnishes us evidence that little change has
    taken place in the language since the earliest times, in the statement
    that all the geographical names of the peninsula are Maya, which
    is considered proof in his judgment that the Mayas were the first
    occupants of the country.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> It is but a reasonable expectation,
    therefore, that at no distant day, by the aid of Landa’s alphabet, the
    inscriptions will be compelled to reveal their mysterious contents.
    The Tzendal, the language in which Votan is said to have written a
    history of the foundation of his city, and still spoken near the ruins
    of Palenque, is said to have been the oldest of American languages,
    but linguistic investigations have proven that it is an offshoot from
    the Maya, the mother tongue.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> It is probable that the Maya was
    first planted at some point in the territory which it now occupies, and
    gradually extended its domain until its colonies reached northern Vera
    Cruz and southern Nicaragua. Whether at any time it was the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>language
    of a people inhabiting central and southern Mexico at a date anterior
    to the arrival of the Nahuas, is unknown though probable. Señor Orozco
    y Berra has shown by linguistic studies that probably the Mayas
    occupied the Atlantic seaboard of the United States, having in their
    migration passed from the Floridian peninsula to Cuba and thence to the
    other Caribbean isles, and to Yucatan. He states that the Mayas possess
    traditions of a northern home from which they passed by means of the
    islands of the Gulf to Yucatan. Both he and Señor Pimentel agree that
    the languages of the West Indies belong to the Maya family.<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

  <p>The characteristics of the Maya-Quiché languages are; flexibility,
    expressiveness, vigor, approximating harshness, yet on the contrary
    rich and musical in sound. The Maya itself has more than once been
    compared to the Greek, and even said to be derived from it. Dr. Le
    Plongeon, who for four years has been exploring the ruins of Yucatan
    and especially of Chichen-Itza, writes thus in connection with the
    discovery of a well-sculptured bear’s head at Uxmal: “When did bears
    inhabit the peninsula? Strange to say, the Maya does not furnish the
    name for bear. Yet one-third of this tongue is pure Greek. Who brought
    the dialect of Homer to America? Or who took to Greece that of the
    Mayas? Greek is the offspring of the Sanscrit. Is Maya? Or are they
    coeval? A clue for ethnologists to follow the migrations of the human
    family on this old continent. Did the bearded men whose portraits
    are carved on the massive pillars of the fortress at Chichen-Itza,
    belong to the Mayan nations? The Maya is not devoid of words from the
    Assyrian.”<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> He does not hesitate to say that “the Maya, containing
    words from almost every language, ancient or modern, is well worth
    the attention of philologists,” a statement which might with but
    little breach of propriety be made as well concerning almost any
    other language. In referring to its antiquity, the writer says, “I
    must <span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>speak of that language which has survived unaltered through the
    vicissitudes of the nations that spoke it thousands of years ago, and
    is yet the general tongue in Yucatan—the Maya. There can be no doubt
    that this is one of the most ancient languages on earth. It was used by
    a people that lived at least 6000 years ago, as proved by the Katuns,
    to record the history of their rulers, the dogmas of their religion, on
    the walls of their palaces, on the façades of their temples.”<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> The
    Mexican scholar, Señor Melgar, is convinced that he sees resemblances
    between the names employed by the Chiapenecs in their calendar, and
    the Hebrew, and furnishes comparative lists to sustain his hopeless
    theory.<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span></p>

  <p>The speculations of the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg are none the
    less remarkable and about equally as plausible as those of Dr. Le
    Plongeon or Señor Melgar. The Abbé after years of study among the
    peoples of Central America, was convinced beyond a doubt that a marked
    relationship existed between the Quiché-Cakchiquel and Zutugil and the
    languages of the north of Europe. He considers the evidence sufficient
    that peoples speaking the Germanic and Scandinavian languages migrated
    to Central America and infused their idioms into the Maya.<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

  <p>With Mr. Bancroft we agree that no value can be attached to these
    speculations, until impartial comparisons are made by scholars who
    have no theories to substantiate. It is worthy of note that several
    eminent scholars have observed the remarkable similarity of grammatical
    structure between the Central American and certain transatlantic
    languages, especially the Basque<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>and some of the languages of
    Western Africa.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> Dr. Le Plongeon, after several years spent amid
    the antiquities of Peru and in the study of the Quichua language,
    says, “The Quichua contains many words that seem closely allied to the
    dialects spoken by the nations inhabiting the regions called to-day
    Central America, and the Maya tongue.” In referring to the mural
    paintings at Chichen-Itza, he further remarks, “By comparing them with
    those of the Quichuas, I cannot but believe that Manco’s ancestors
    emigrated from Xilbalba or Mayapan, carrying with them the notions of
    the northern country.”<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> Interesting as these speculations are, they
    must be received with allowance and viewed with doubt, until thorough
    linguistic researches test their value.</p>

  <p>The most important features of Maya grammar are as follows: The letters
    of the alphabet are, a b c ɔ e, ch, c<i>h</i>, h, i, k, l, m, n, o,
    p, <i>p</i>, ó, pp, t, th, tz, u, x, y, <i>y</i>, z. The letter ɔ is
    pronounced like the English <i>dj</i>, <i>h</i> is not aspirated,
    <i>th</i> is hard, and the <i>k</i> guttural. Much of the beauty of the
    pronunciation depends on the elision of certain vowels and consonants,
    as for instance instead of <i>ma in kati</i> they say <i>min kati</i>,
    or instead of <i>ti ca otoch</i> they would say <i>ti c otoch</i>. The
    plural is distinguished from the singular by the addition of <i>ob</i>
    (those). Verbs ending in <i>an</i> take <i>tac</i> in the plural. The
    masculine of rational beings <span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>is denoted by the prefix <i>ab</i>,
    the feminine by <i>ix</i>. The words <i>xibil</i> and <i>chupul</i>,
    signifying male and female respectively, are used to express the gender
    of animals. The case of nouns is determined by their position in the
    sentence and their relation to the prepositions, the most frequent
    of the latter being <i>ti</i>, which has various significations.
    Adjectives accompanying substantives always precede them, but the
    number is only expressed by the substantive. The comparative is formed
    by adding <i>l</i> to the adjective, sometimes <i>il</i>, and prefixing
    <i>u</i> or <i>y</i> the pronoun of the third person. The superlative
    is formed by prefixing <i>hach</i> to the positive.</p>

  <p>In the state of Oajaca and occupying the western portion of the Isthmus
    of Tehuantepec, in a position intermediate between the Maya on the
    one hand and the Nahua on the other, is found the ancient family of
    languages known as the Mizteco-Zapotec, the various dialects of which
    are spoken to this day by the natives occupying those regions. No
    tradition throws any light on the origin of this group, nor do any
    affiliations in vocabulary or grammmatical structure seem to exist
    between them and any other family, American or foreign. The Miztec
    language is exceedingly difficult to acquire, being characterized by
    words of extraordinary length. The Zapotec on the contrary, with its
    several dialects, is elegant, sonorous, and <em>less</em> difficult.<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

  <p>The language pre-eminent above all others in Mexico for its territorial
    extent, for the refinement and civilization which it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>represented, and
    its own inherent beauty and elegance, is known as the Nahua or Aztec,
    or more modernly the Mexican. It was the language of the Toltecs and
    of their advanced civilization, and after them of the seven tribes of
    <i>Nahuatlacas</i>, that in the year 1196 established themselves in
    the Mexican plateau. The Aztecs, one of these tribes, in the course of
    events gaining the ascendency, gave their name to the language which
    their conquests speedily extended over a territory four hundred leagues
    in length, and in width from the Gulf to the Pacific, in the latitude
    of the capital. The Aztec tongue prevailed continuously from a point
    on the Gulf of California, under the twenty-sixth parallel of latitude
    south-easterly to Rios Goatzacoalco and Tobasco; and southward to the
    fifteenth parallel, extending along the coast of San Salvador and
    appearing in the interior of Nicaragua. Its dialectical extension north
    of Mexico we will consider on a future page. Twenty languages besides
    the Aztec are said to have been spoken throughout Montezuma’s empire,
    but the Aztec alone was recognized as the official and classic tongue.
    The Chichimecs are said to have spoken a language of their own, until
    the ruler Techotlalatzin commanded them to learn the Mexican.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> Mr.
    Bancroft is of the opinion that the Nahua was the original language of
    the Chichimecs, and consequently does not agree with Señor Pimentel
    who advocates the opposite view, and, we think, sustains it.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> The
    copiousness and grace of the Aztec has furnished a theme for many
    Spanish writers whose praises have found an echo in the works of our
    most able scholars and historians. If the Maya has been compared to the
    Greek, the Aztec has often been likened to the Latin, not in structure
    or vocabulary, but in its relation to ancient American civilization,
    in its expressiveness, politeness, its capacity for the sublime, and
    for the romantic coloring with which it is able to clothe that which is
    humble and even insignificant. “It was the court language,” says Mr.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>Bancroft, “of American civilization, the Latin of medieval and the
    French of modern times.”<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

  <p>The Nahua attained its highest development during the century preceding
    the conquest in the schools of oratory, poetry and history, established
    at Tezcuco, to which the sons of nobles were sent, as much to acquire
    the purity of the idiom as the science which they taught.<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> Señor
    Orozco y Berra says that the difference existing between the ancient
    Nahua and the modern, may be compared to that difference observed
    between the Castilian of the Romance of the Cid and that of the present
    day.<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

  <p>The outlines of the Aztec grammar are briefly as follows: The alphabet
    contains the letters a, ch, e, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, t, tl, tz, u, v,
    x, y, z, but lacks our consonants b, d, f, r, g, s. No word commences
    with l. The <i>a</i> is clear; <i>ch</i> before a vowel is pronounced
    as in Spanish, but before a consonant or when final it differs
    somewhat; <i>e</i> is clear; <i>h</i> is moderately aspirated and soft,
    but strong when it precedes <i>u</i>; <i>t</i> is omitted except when
    it comes between two <i>l’s</i>. The <i>tl</i> in the middle of a word
    is soft as in Spanish, but at the end is pronounced <i>tle</i>, the
    <i>e</i> being half mute. The pronunciation of <i>tz</i> is similar
    to the Spanish <i>s</i>, but stronger. The <i>v</i> is pronounced by
    the women as in Spanish and French, but by the men like <i>hu</i> in
    Spanish; <i>x</i>, soft like the English <i>sh</i>, and <i>z</i> like
    the Spanish <i>s</i>, but not quite so hissing.<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span></p>

  <p>By composition, words containing sixteen syllables are formed,
    though many simple words are quite long. We have already explained
    the process of polysynthesis or compounding by means of clipping the
    syllables and words with a view to brevity and euphony. The following
    example furnished by Pimentel and copied by Mr. Bancroft, further
    illustrates the principle: <i>tlazotli</i>, esteemed or loved;
    <i>maviztik</i>, honored or reverenced; <i>teopixki</i>, priest;
    <i>tatli</i>, father, and <i>no</i>, mine, furnishes as a result:
    <i>notlazomaviztcopixkatatzin</i>, “my esteemed father and reverend
    priest.” An example of the termination <i>tzin</i>, signifying respect,
    is presented in this word. Several illustrations of the same principle
    are furnished by Señor Pimentel, showing that often a sentence is
    compounded into a single word. Indeed a great many of the component
    parts of these long words, though words in themselves, are incapable of
    being used separately. In composition the verb succeeds the nominative
    and is placed at the end of the sentence. The adverb precedes the verb,
    as does the adjective the substantive.</p>

  <p>The Aztec is rich in terminations for the formation of the plural.
    Generally no change is required for inanimate objects, as multiplicity
    is expressed by means of numerals or the adverb <i>miek</i> (much),
    e. g., <i>ze tetl</i>, one stone; <i>yei tetl</i>, three stones;
    <i>miek tetl</i>, many stones, though often the terminations used for
    the plural of persons is applied to inanimate objects, particularly
    when they are connected with persons, as <i>zoquitl</i>, mud;
    <i>tizoquime</i>, we are earth; however, there are exceptions to the
    rule, as in the Aztec words for the heavens, the mountains and the
    stars. Furthermore, the first syllable is often doubled in order to
    form the plural of inanimate things. Señor Pimentel has embraced the
    entire subject of the formation of the plural in six rules.</p>

  <p>1. Primitive words form their plural in <i>me tin</i> or <i>ke</i>, as
    <i>ichkatl</i>, a ewe, a sheep; <i>ichkame</i>, sheep; <i>zolin</i>, a
    quail; <i>zoltin</i>, quail; <i>kokoxki</i>, sick; <i>kokoxke</i>, sick
    (plural).</p>

  <p>2. Derivatives form their plural as follows: the so-called
    “reverentials” in <i>tzintli</i>, have the plural in <i>tzitzintin</i>;
    the diminutives in <i>tontli</i> form the plural <i>totontin</i>,
    and the diminutives in <i>ton</i> and <i>pil</i>, augmentatives in
    <i>pol</i> and reverentials in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span> <i>tzin</i> double the final syllable;
    as, <i>tlakatzintli</i>, person; <i>tlakatzitzintin</i>, persons, etc.</p>

  <p>3. Words either primitive or derived into which the possessive
    pronouns enter, form the plural in <i>van</i> (<i>huan</i> according
    to the common orthography); as, <i>noichkavan</i>, my sheep,
    <i>noichkatotonvan</i>, my little sheep.</p>

  <p>4. The words <i>tlakatl</i>, person; <i>zivatl</i>, woman; terms of
    gentilitious character or expressive of office and profession, form
    their plural by the omission of the final letters, as <i>Mexicatl</i>,
    a Mexican; <i>Mexika</i>, Mexicans; in which case the final vowel is
    accented.</p>

  <p>5. Some words form the plural by omitting the terminals and by doubling
    the first syllable, while others double the first syllable without
    omitting the terminal; as, <i>teotl</i>, god; <i>teteo</i>, gods;
    <i>zolin</i>, quail; <i>zozoltin</i>, quails; <i>telpochtli</i> and
    <i>ichpochtli</i>, double the syllable <i>po</i>.</p>

  <p>6. Some adjectives have various plurals, as <i>miek</i>, much; whose
    plural is <i>miektin</i>, <i>miekintin</i> or <i>miekin</i>.</p>

  <p>In most cases the adjective and its substantive agree in number. The
    only means of expressing gender is by adding the words <i>okichtli</i>,
    male, and <i>zivatl</i>, female.</p>

  <p>In the absence of a regular declension the cases are formed as
    follows: The genitive is indicated by the possessive pronoun or by
    the juxtaposition of the words, the dative by means of verbs called
    applicatives, the accusative by certain particles accompanying the verb
    or by juxtaposition, the vocative by adding e to the nominative or by
    the change of <i>i</i> into <i>e</i> in words ending in <i>tli</i>
    or <i>li</i> and the <i>in</i> into <i>e</i> in words ending in
    <i>tzin</i>.</p>

  <p>The ablative is indicated by various particles and prepositions. The
    language surpasses the Italian in the number of its augmentatives
    and diminutives. The former take the syllable <i>pol</i>, the latter
    <i>tontli</i> and <i>ton</i>. The Aztec is richer in verbal nouns
    than any other language. Those derived from active, neuter, passive,
    reflective and impersonal verbs, terminate in <i>ni</i>, <i>oni</i>,
    <i>ya</i>, <i>ia</i>, <i>yan</i>, <i>kan</i> or <i>ian</i>, <i>tli</i>,
    <i>li</i>, <i>liztli</i>, <i>oka</i>, <i>ka</i>, <i>ki</i>, <i>k</i>,
    <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>tl</i>.</p>

  <p>There is no infinitive in the conjugation, it being expressed by the
    future indicative. Only verbs in <i>liztli</i> have this mode. The
    passive voice, save in a few exceptional cases, is formed as follows:
    <i>lo</i> is added to the present indicative of the active voice. In
    the perfect tense, <i>k</i> is added to the previously affixed <i>o</i>
    in the singular and <i>ke</i> in the plural. The other modes and tenses
    form their passive voice by adding to the present indicative passive
    their own final termination, as, for instance, we have <i>nichiva</i>,
    I make, <i>nichivalo</i>, I am made, <i>onichivalok</i>, I was made,
    <i>onichivaloka</i>, that I should be made, etc. The Aztec contains
    only six irregular verbs.</p>

  <p>Language has ever been an important factor in determining the original
    home and the migrations of peoples. With this view the Aztec has
    received the attention of some of the best scholars of both continents.
    The most prominent results merit attention. The Nahua language is
    unquestionably spoken far to the south, in Guatemala, Honduras and
    Nicaragua, and this fact has been persistently cited as conclusive
    proof of the southern origin of the Nahuas; but even Mr. Bancroft, the
    most eminent of the advocates of this hypothesis, admits that there
    “it is dialectic rather than aboriginal in appearance, so that the
    testimony of language is all in favor of the plateau of Anahuac having
    been the primal centre of the Aztec tongue.”<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

  <p>The reports of several of the adventurers into the unexplored north,
    were to the effect that the aborigines whom they encountered spoke
    Aztec. Father Roque of Oñate’s expedition into New Mexico at the close
    of the sixteenth century, and Father Gerónimo de Zárate subsequently
    at the Rio del Tizon, are authority for the most positive statements
    that the Mexican was encountered. Mr. Anderson, a companion of Captain
    Cook in 1778, discovered the Aztec terminal <i>l</i> <i>tl</i> or
    <i>z</i> of frequent occurrence among the Nootkas of the North-west
    coast. With this data and the traditions of the Aztecs, which all point
    to the north as their ancient home, sufficient basis was found for a
    general belief that the Mexican peoples had migrated down the coast
    of California and left an unbroken linguistic line along the entire
    route of their wanderings. At the beginning of the present century, the
    great German philologist, Vater, sought to establish this line by his
    extensive investigations, published in his <cite>Mithridates</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
    Unfortunately for his labors, later researches have shown his
    generalizations too sweeping. Wilhelm von Humboldt considered the Cora,
    under the twenty-second degree of latitude <span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>on the Rio de Santiago,
    to be a mixture of Aztec and some older and rougher language.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> In
    1855–59, Dr. Buschmann of Berlin issued two celebrated works,<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> in
    which the subject was critically examined, and as far as possible,
    with the data at hand, the true proportion of Aztec elements entering
    into all the languages spoken north of the Mexican plateau, was
    indicated. The researches were systematically made, beginning with
    the North Mexican, languages and proceeding northward in the supposed
    line of the Aztec migration. In four languages of North-western Mexico
    in particular, did Dr. Buschmann find the conspicuous presence of
    Aztec elements. These are the Cora of Jalisco, referred to above;
    the Tepehuana of northern Sinaloa, Durango and southern Chihuahua,
    spoken between the twenty-third and twenty-seventh parallels, in a
    crescent-shaped territory the points of which touch the Aztec on
    the west, intervening between it and the Gulf of California; the
    Tarahumara, spoken in the Sierra Madre, of the State of Chihuahua and
    Sonora, and fourthly, the Cahita occupying the east coast of the Gulf
    of California between the twenty-sixth and twenty-eighth parallels.
    By a liberty in classification, Buschmann calls this group the Sonora
    family, although the languages are entirely different from each other,
    with the exception that they are all pervaded by the Aztec element.
    This is their only bond of union. They contain about two hundred
    Aztec words, and about eight hundred words derived from the Aztec in
    the several idioms.<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> “The Aztec <i>tl</i>, and <i>tli</i> in the
    Cora, are found changed in <i>ti</i>, <i>te</i> and <i>t</i>; in the
    Tepehuana into <i>de</i>, <i>re</i> and <i>sci</i>; in the Tarahumara
    into <i>ki</i>, <i>ke</i>, <i>ca</i> and <i>la</i>, and in the Cahita,
    into <i>ri</i>. In all four of the languages substantive endings are
    dropped, first, in composition when the substantive is united with
    the possessive pronoun; secondly, before an affix; thirdly, in the
    Cora alone, before the ending of the plural and before affixes in the
    formation of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>words.”<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> North-east of the Tarahumara and reaching
    to the Rio Grande is the Cnocho, and directly to the east of the
    Cnocho, is the territory of the Toboso, also bounded on the north
    by the Rio Grande. It is uncertain whether the Aztec was ever the
    language of these large districts, though testimony is not wanting
    that it was understood by both peoples.<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> In fact throughout all
    northern Mexico, the Aztec was understood, and, in some instances,
    entered prominently into the languages of the north-western tribes.
    Grimm’s law of <i>Lautveränderung</i>, sound changing or shifting,
    is as conspicuous in its application to the Aztec-Sonora family of
    Buschmann as it is to the members of the Aryan family, and often far
    more so. Occupying the north-western extremity of Mexico are the
    Pima-Alto and Bajo, and the Opata, the principal dialect of the latter
    being the Eudeve. Here again the Aztec appears both in the identity
    of words and the similarity of grammatical structure. These languages
    are recognized as branches of the Aztec-Sonora family, so much so
    that Orozco y Berra has classified them together under the name of
    the Opata-Tarahumar-Pima. He accounts for the presence of the Aztec
    element upon the supposition that the language and civilization of
    Mexico once extended over this region, but were subverted and displaced
    by the incursions of northern peoples toward the close of the twelfth
    century.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> Not only is this probable, but, on the other hand, it
    would be a matter of surprise if traces of the Aztec were not found
    in languages bordering upon so vast and powerful an empire as that of
    Montezuma. Still this fact alone is scarcely sufficient to account for
    the prominence of the Aztec element in the northern languages, while it
    is almost totally wanting in others more central and southern. Crossing
    into the United States territory, we first encounter the Moqui of the
    pueblo towns of Arizona; to the west in south-eastern California, we
    meet the Cahuillo, Chemehuevi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span> Kizh, Netela and Kechi; at the other
    extreme on the east, we have the Comanche of New Mexico and Texas,
    while to the north, in Utah, Nevada, Idaho and Oregon, we have the
    great Shoshone and Utah families. But why group these languages in
    such a wholesale manner? Is it because of inter-linguistic affinities?
    No. Simply because of the Aztec element (though insignificant it is
    true), which unquestionably pervades them all.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> Six of the Moqui
    towns speak the language which bears their name. But, strange to say,
    Harno the Seventh uses the Tequa, a language of one of the New Mexican
    Pueblos. The Moqui language contains much that is Aztec, and because of
    its substantive endings in <i>pe</i> and <i>be</i>, etc., is considered
    by Buschmann a branch of his Shoshone-Comanche family of the Sonora
    idiom.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> Coupling this fact with the traditions of the Moquis (see
    <a href="#Page_302">pages 302–304</a>) descriptive of their migrations from the North under the
    pressure of the hordes of savages who deprived them of their cultivated
    lands and slaughtered their families, we are at a loss to account for
    this infusion of Aztec elements, except on the hypothesis that at a
    remote day large numbers of Nahuas came in contact with the ancestors
    of this people in their ancient home. Equally conspicuous is the Aztec
    element in south-east California languages and the great Shoshone and
    Utah families, which occupy the great central basin and stretch away
    into Idaho and Oregon. Grimm’s law of sound-shifting is seen in their
    adjective and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>substantive endings, <i>p</i>, <i>pa</i>, <i>pe</i>,
    <i>pi</i>, <i>be</i>, <i>wa</i>, <i>ph</i>, <i>pee</i>, <i>rp</i>, and
    <i>rpe</i>. The Shoshone and Utah still retain <i>ts</i>, <i>tse</i>,
    and <i>tsi</i>, all of which are but variations of the Aztec <i>tl</i>,
    <i>tli</i>, according to the law above-named. Buschmann pronounces
    this group the capstone of his Sonora edifice.<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> In Western Oregon,
    from the source to the mouth of the Willamette River, the Yamkally and
    Calapooya languages preserve traces of the Aztec both in words and
    terminal sounds.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> The same is even more evident concerning the
    Chinook, of the lower Columbia River, in which the Aztec <i>thl</i>
    and <i>tl</i> is a regular termination.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> Throughout the entire
    region drained by the Columbia and its tributaries, Dr. Buschmann
    found well-marked Aztec elements. The Clallum and Lummi languages of
    the great Salish or Flathead family, which touches the coast opposite
    Vancouver’s Island and extends into the interior, have the <i>tl</i>
    termination and other phonetic resemblances to the Aztec.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
    Furthermore, Mr. Gibbs has discovered that the cardinals employed by
    the Clallam and Lummi in their system of enumeration are of a threefold
    character, and, as Mr. Gallatin has shown, are similar to those of the
    Mexicans and Mayas.<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span></p>

  <p>Whether the Aztec is represented in the language of the Nootkas
    on Vancouver’s Island is uncertain. Certainly strong marks of
    similarity are observable. Buschmann, while admitting the existence
    of resemblances, thinks that hardly enough of them exist to warrant
    relationship.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> The inquiry naturally arises, how came this Aztec
    element which, three and a half centuries <span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>after the overthrow of the
    Aztec empire, we observe in faint, though unbroken lines running from
    the centre of Mexico to the vicinity of Vancouver’s Island to find its
    way into a multitude of languages, some of which are separated from
    others by a vast region more than two thousand miles in width? How
    did it come to be the only bond of union between so many languages
    in all other respects so dissimilar? It has been suggested that this
    wide-spread dissemination of the Aztec is owing to the trade probably
    carried on between Mexico and the North. However, this is merely
    conjecture and is incapable of proof. It will be observed that the
    linguistic line is faintest in the central basin among the Shoshones
    and Utahs, where the relationship is established mainly by the
    sound-shifting of the terminals according to Grimm’s law, but in the
    languages of the Columbia River and its tributaries, and especially of
    the Salish or Flathead family bordering on the strait of Juan de Fuca,
    the Aztec terminal is actually present and in constant use. The most
    critical researches have established this as an incontestable fact. In
    this connection it is worthy of note (as shown in our first chapter)
    that the works of the Mound-builders abound in this region in great
    numbers, extending into the interior, appearing upon the upper Missouri
    and its tributaries, and continuing to the Mississippi Valley and
    thence into Mexico instead of following the coast or the central basin
    at the west. Whether the Nahua was the language of the Mound-builders
    of the United States, we are unable to determine, but the probabilities
    that it was are considerable; because (1) the people of the mounds
    built structures similar to those which prevail all over Mexico,
    though in a less degree of perfection; (2) they carried obsidian
    from Mexico to the North Mississippi Valley, showing both regions
    to have enjoyed intimate commercial relations. This is no evidence
    that the Mound-builders were colonists sent out from Mexico, since it
    is improbable that colonists would have penetrated into the extreme
    North-west by way of the Missouri River. Furthermore we have the
    valuable argument of Baron von Hellwald made at the Luxembourg session
    of the Congrès International des Américanistes in favor of a migration
    from north to south, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span> his reply to Mr. Robert S. Robertson’s paper
    on “the Mound-builders,” namely, that no evidence exists of the
    Mexicans or Central Americans having worked copper mines anterior to
    the conquest; hence it follows that since copper was employed by both
    Mexicans and Mound-builders, it must have been carried southward by the
    latter.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> (3) We have testimony of the early writers that the Nahuas
    came from the North-east; Sahagun says from the direction of Florida,
    which then embraced the Mississippi Valley. (4) We have the statements
    of Acosta and Sahagun that the Apalaches occupying the region east of
    the Mississippi extended their colonies far into Mexico. According to
    Acosta the Mexicans called them Apalaches, Tlautuics or Mountaineers.
    “Sahagun speaking of them says: ‘They are Nahuas and speak the Mexican
    language.’ This is by no means improbable, as the Aztec is found
    eastward in the present states of Tamaulipas and Coahuila, and thence
    the distance to the Mississippi is not so far.”<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> In their search
    for the Aztec element in the North, every investigator—Buschmann
    among the rest—has made a great oversight. They have expected to
    find resemblances to the Aztec as it was spoken at the time of the
    conquest after centuries of culture had been bestowed upon it in the
    schools of Mexico and Tezcuco. It appears never to have occurred to
    these scholars, that if Mexican similarities exist at the North they
    are with the ancient form of the Nahua, which Orozco y Berra tells us
    “differs as much from the modern Nahua or Aztec as the Spanish of the
    Romance of the Cid from the Spanish of to-day,” or coming nearer home,
    we may say that it probably differed as much as the Anglo-Saxon of
    King Alfred and the English of the present. The linguistic researches
    referred to have certainly been made over a wide chasm of time and
    change, as viewed in this light, and when we consider the instability
    of language in America, the wonder is that any <span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>Nahua traces exist
    at the North-west at this late date.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> This phenomenon can only
    be accounted for on the supposition that, at a remote period, large
    numbers of Nahua-speaking people resided for a considerable length of
    time in those regions. The presence of the mounds in such numbers in
    Washington and the British possessions north of it, leads to this view,
    provided it can be established that the Mound-builders were Nahuas.
    The fact that the line of mounds is toward the interior precludes the
    expectation that the Nahua is to be found prominently present west of
    the Rocky Mountains. It is plausible to consider the Moquis a branch
    from the Nahuas, separating from them at an early day and establishing
    themselves in Southern Oregon and Utah, whence, according to their
    tradition, they were driven by the Utes. In the course of time, their
    language, which contains a Nahua element, may have become changed and
    lost much of its original character. To their residence, migration, and
    the possible captivity of many of their number, the traces of Aztec
    found in the Shoshone and Utah tongues may be due.</p>

  <p>Analogies between the Nahua and all the other languages of the world
    have been assiduously sought for, and supposed affiliations advocated
    by theorists, but in the present unsatisfactory state of philological
    science it would be presumptuous for us to pretend that any claim for
    linguistic analogies with the old world could be sustained. There is no
    doubt that strong analogies are observable between the Otomi and the
    Chinese. Señor Najera, to whom the former is vernacular, has appended
    to his excellent grammar of the Otomi a comparative table of Chinese
    and Otomi words, which while it shows strong resemblances, is not
    sufficient in itself to establish relationship.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span></p>

  <p>Warden has treated the grammatical resemblances, which in many respects
    are striking.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> It is one of the most singular phenomena met with
    in the whole range of ethnography and philology, that a monosyllabic
    language should be found in the very heart of Mexico surrounded by
    the most remarkable poly-syllabism in the world, touching the capital
    on the south-east and extending north-west into San Luis Potosi and
    over portions of Queretaro and Guanajuato. It is no doubt a language
    of great antiquity, and whether Chinese in origin is not fully
    determined.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> Numerous claims have been set forth that some of the
    Californian languages bear a striking resemblance to the Chinese, and
    that Indians and Chinese in some cases have found so much in common in
    their respective languages as to be able to hold conversations with
    each other. These claims have in most instances been supported by
    persons having little knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span> of the principles of philology, and
    who are scarcely aware of the difficulty of comparing two monosyllabic
    languages in which the finest shade of pronunciation carries with
    it the greatest significance.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> Japanese claims have been urged
    with some reason by ethnologists no less eminent than Latham, who is
    confident that the “Kamskadale, Koriak, Aino-Japanese and the Korean
    are the Asiatic languages most like those of America.”<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

  <p>Comparisons of the Indian languages with those of the old world
    have often been made, most frequently in a haphazard manner and
    to little purpose. Recently, however, Herr Forchhammer of Leipzig
    published a truly scientific comparison of the grammatical structure
    of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Muskogee and Seminole languages, with the
    Ural-Altaic tongues, in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>which he has developed many interesting points
    of resemblance.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> Prof. Valentini has called attention to the fact
    that Ptolemy (Geography, Asia Minor, Chapter X, Armenia Major) gives
    in his list of cities belonging to the Roman province in his time
    (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 140), the names of five cities situated in the region
    of the historic Ararat, which have nearly their counterpart in five
    proper names applied to localities in Mexico by its ancient colonists.
    The cities of Armenia Major, according to Ptolemy, are: Chol, Colua,
    Zuivana, Cholima, Zalissa. “The first name <i>Chol</i> is contained
    in <i>Cholula</i>; the second, <i>Colua</i>, in <i>Coluacan</i>;
    the third, <i>Zu vana</i>, in <i>Zuivan</i>, which is the ancient
    name of the Yucatanic province of Bacalab (see Perez in Stephens’
    <cite>Yucatan</cite>, Appendix, vol. ii, <cite>Chronology of Yucatan</cite>).
    <i>Cholima</i> is to-day written <i>Colima</i>, <i>Zalissa</i> is
    contained in <i>Xalisco</i>, the Spanish <i>x</i> sounding in the
    Nahua language like the English <i>sh</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Generally we have
    been disposed to pronounce all such coincidences accidental, as most
    of them certainly are. In this case we leave the decision to the
    reader. In this chapter we have noticed two prominent families of
    languages, (1) the Maya-Quiché, having such transatlantic affinities
    as to furnish presumptive evidence that if it did not originate from,
    it was at least influenced by the West European or African languages.
    (2) The great Nahua family, which linguistic researches, together
    with the circumstantial evidence furnished by architectural remains,
    commercial intercourse and the testimony of early writers, assign to at
    least a temporary occupancy of the Columbian region on the North-west
    coast. Concede this fact, and you must look elsewhere, possibly to the
    opposite continent, for the early beginnings of a language so ancient
    and polished.</p>

  <p>While the proof is not conclusive, yet we think it is presumptive that
    both of these families, as well as some other American languages, are
    of old world origin.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">WE have observed that traditional and linguistic evidence seems to
    point to a trans-Atlantic origin for some of the American peoples. In a
    preceding chapter (iii), we quoted the story of the Platonic Atlantis,
    as recorded in the <cite>Critias</cite>, and alluded to the advocacy by
    the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg of the hypothesis that the submerged
    continent of Egyptian tradition was a reality. In support of this
    view, the Abbé has cited the opinions of geologists and the remarkable
    traditions preserved by the Central Americans, the Mexicans, and the
    Haytians, concerning the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions which
    submerged beneath the ocean a continent, of which the Antilles are but
    its mountain summits. Attach as little importance as we may to these
    ancient legends, which no doubt refer to some extraordinary cataclysm,
    the memory of which was preserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span> for ages by periodic feasts and
    religious celebrations,<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> in which the gods were besought by princes
    and people for security against a similar calamity, still our minds
    naturally associate them with the story of the Platonic Atlantis.<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span></p>

  <p>Until recently the mere expression of belief in the former existence
    of an Atlantic continent has been the signal for criticism, and has
    called forth the smile of pity, if not of contempt. Such, however, is
    no longer true, since scientific investigation, consisting chiefly in
    deep-sea soundings and the study of the fauna and flora of the opposite
    shores of the Atlantic, call for the respectful attention of all who
    are interested in the ancient history of this continent. Prominent
    among the men of science who have expressed confidence in this
    hypothesis is Prof. Andres Retzius of Stockholm, who was convinced from
    a study of comparative craniology, that the primitive dolichocephalic
    skulls of America, especially of the ancient Caribs of the Antilles,
    were nearly related to the <i>Guanches</i> of the Canary Islands.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

  <p>Dr. Le Plongeon observed that the sandals upon the feet of the
    statue of Chaacmol, discovered at Chichen-Itza, and of the statue
    of a priestess found on the island of Mugeres, “are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>exact
    representations of those found on the feet of the <i>Guanches</i>,
    the early inhabitants of the Canary Islands, whose mummies are yet
    occasionally met with in the caves of Teneriffe and the other isles
    of the group.”<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> The great number of American plant-types in the
    Miocene flora of Switzerland, led Prof. Unger to espouse the view
    that a continent formerly existed in the present Atlantic ocean.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>
    Professor Heer, the celebrated botanist of Zurich, for the same
    reasons promulgated this hypothesis, and in his <cite>Flora Tertiaria
    Helvetiæ</cite>, defines the location of the continent, which he believes
    to have been as wide as Europe.<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> In opposition to this view, it
    is urged by Professors Oliver and Asa Gray, that the flora of America
    and Europe are united by means of a former overland communication at
    Behring’s Straits.<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> The conformation of the ocean-bed is the next
    matter of importance in examining the subject. The deep-sea soundings
    taken for the submarine cable between Newfoundland and Ireland, led
    to the impression that the Atlantic floor was comparatively a level,
    forming but one great trough between the continents. The United States
    exploring ship <cite>Dolphin</cite>, however, subsequently dispelled this
    illusion, by revealing the fact that a great submarine plateau or
    mountain chain which has been denominated the “Dolphin Rise,” divided
    the North Atlantic into two longitudinal troughs running north and
    south. This is described as a seal-shaped ridge with its tail joining
    a connecting ridge at the south in 15° North Lat. and 45° West Long.,
    while its body widens as it runs towards the north, reaching its
    maximum width under the forty-fifth parallel, and finally tapering to
    a narrow isthmus at 52° North Lat. and 30° West Long., which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>connects
    the ridge with the great northern submarine table-land.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

  <p>This work was prosecuted further by the German frigate <cite>Gazelle</cite>,
    and by H. M. ships <cite>Lightning</cite> and <cite>Porcupine</cite>, with
    confirmatory results.<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> The most thorough and satisfactory work
    of this character, however, was performed during the cruise of H. M.
    ship <cite>Challenger</cite>, from December 30, 1872, until May 24, 1876,
    inclusive. Sir C. Wyville Thomson, the director of the expedition, in
    his excellent work, <cite>The Atlantic</cite>, has contributed much exact
    information relative to the contour of the sea-bed. The frontispiece
    to his second volume is a chart illustrative of the relative depths of
    different localities in the Atlantic ocean. Almost its entire length
    from north to south, the great chain whose loftiest summits tower above
    the sea in the Azores Islands, St. Paul’s Rocks, Ascension and St.
    Helena Islands, is indicated by a white irregular belt representing
    a depth of one thousand fathoms, but shading off into the blue,
    indicative of the depths on either hand. Professor Thomson says,
    “Combining our own observations with reliable data which have been
    previously or subsequently acquired, we find the mean depth of the
    Atlantic is a little over 2000 fathoms. An elevated ridge rising to
    an average height of about 1900 fathoms below the surface, traverses
    the basin of the North and South Atlantic, in a meridional direction
    from Cape Farewell, probably as far south, at least, as Gough Island,
    following roughly the outlines of the coasts of the old and new worlds.
    A branch of this elevation strikes off to the south-westward, about the
    parallel of 10° North, and connects it with the coast of South America
    at Cape Orange; and another branch across the eastern trough, joining
    the continent of Africa, probably about the parallel of 25° South.”<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span></p>

  <p>The width of the great land ridge as well as its relation to the
    North Atlantic islands is indicated in the following: “One of the
    most remarkable differences between the Azores and Bermuda is, that
    while Bermuda springs up an isolated peak from a great depth, the
    Azores seem to be simply the highest points of a great plateau-like
    elevation, which extends for upwards of a thousand miles from west
    to east, and appears to be continuous with a belt of shallow water
    stretching to Iceland in the north and connected probably with the
    ‘Dolphin Rise’ to the southward, a plateau which in fact divides the
    North Atlantic longitudinally into two great valleys, an eastern and a
    western.”<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> A member of the <cite>Challenger</cite> staff, in a lecture
    delivered in London soon after the termination of the expedition,
    expressed the fullest confidence that the great submarine plateau is
    the remains of the “lost Atlantis,” citing as proof the fact that the
    inequalities, the mountains and valleys of its surface, could never
    have been produced in accordance with any laws for the deposition of
    sediment nor by submarine elevation, but, on the contrary, must have
    been carved by agencies acting above the water level.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> The volcanic
    character of the Azores and Philippines, together with the prevalence
    of volcanic deposits found upon the entire ridge by the officers of
    the <cite>Challenger</cite>, lend probability to the Egyptian and American
    legends of a tremendous catastrophe in which a continent was submerged
    beneath the waves.<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

  <p>Sir C. Wyville Thomson found that the fauna of the coast of Brazil
    brought up in his dredging machine, were similar to that of the western
    coast of South Europe.<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> This is of particular interest, since
    at a short distance north of the Amazon an arm of the central ridge
    connects the sunken plateau with the coast of South America. Mr. J.
    Starke Gardner, the eminent English geologist, is of the opinion that
    in the Eocene period a great extension of land existed to the west of
    Cornwall. The extraordinary mingling of American, Asiatic, Australian
    and African <span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>genera in all European floras of the Tertiary period leads
    him to the conviction that at a remote time they were all connected.
    Referring to the locations of the <cite>Dolphin</cite> and <cite>Challenger</cite>
    ridges, he asserts that a great tract of land formerly existed where
    the sea now is, and that Cornwall, the Scilly and Channel islands,
    Ireland and Brittany are the remains of its highest summits.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> The
    question at once arises, “What ground have we for believing that the
    great Atlantic ridges ever occupied a higher altitude than at present?”
    The answer is found in the comparison of facts with the following
    theory set forth by Prof. Joseph Le Conte: “Any increase in the height
    and extent of the whole amount of land on the globe must be attended
    with a corresponding depression of the sea-bottoms, and therefore an
    actual subsidence of the sea-level everywhere. Hence if it be true, as
    is generally believed, that the continents have been, on the whole,
    increasing in extent and in height, in the course of geological
    history, then it is true also that the seas have been subsiding, and
    that therefore the relative changes are the sum of the two.”<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> It
    cannot be denied that the processes of elevation and depression are now
    actively going on along the eastern coast of both the Americas. The
    coast of Greenland is sinking along a distance of 600 miles so markedly
    that ancient buildings on low rock-islands are now submerged, and the
    Greenlander has learned by experience never to build near the water’s
    edge.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> The subsidence along our Atlantic seaboard is slowly going
    on, being most marked on the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, while
    on the other hand the elevation of the eastern coast of South America
    has been accomplished by the hidden forces, volcanic or otherwise,
    on a stupendous scale. “Raised beaches” have been traced 1180 miles
    down the eastern shore and 2075 miles along the western, ranging from
    100 to 1300 feet above the sea, and Alexander Agassiz has recently
    identified them at a height of 3000 feet above the present sea-level
    by means of corals found adhering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span> to the rocks.<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> In view of these
    facts, so familiar to any student of geology, it is not difficult to
    conceive of the former existence of Atlantis where the <cite>Dolphin</cite>
    and <cite>Challenger</cite> locate the mid-Atlantic ridge, described as
    1000 miles in width in the latitude of the Azores. Supposing the
    existence of an Atlantic continent in the Tertiary period conceded,
    we have no means at present of determining the approximate time of
    its subsidence, unless we associate it with the dim and uncertain
    legends of the Egyptian priests and the ancient Americans. Whether the
    Atlantidæ who threatened to overthrow the earliest Greek and Egyptian
    states, but who were swallowed up by the sea in the engulfment of
    their island continent, were the inhabitants of the <cite>Dolphin</cite> and
    <cite>Challenger</cite> ridges and the colonists of Eastern America, must for
    the present at least remain in doubt, though strong probabilities point
    to the conclusion that they were.<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

  <p>The colonization of America by transatlantic peoples, it seems to us,
    did not depend upon the existence of a land bridge at a remote period,
    but could have been accomplished without the aid of the compass, either
    intentionally or accidentally, through the agency of the equatorial
    current and the trade-winds, two mighty forces perpetually tending
    toward the shores of the new world. The return current of the Gulf
    Stream which describes a semicircle in the east Atlantic washes in
    its sweep the Azores, the Madeira, the Canary and Cape Verde Islands,
    approaching in its southern course the shores of Portugal, Morocco, and
    the Sahara Desert, and finally uniting with the stronger equatorial
    current which rushes up the coast of Africa, crosses the Atlantic under
    the equator, and skirts the coast of South America until it reaches the
    Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> The north-east trade-winds
    blowing perpetually from the coast of Europe in a belt from eighteen to
    twenty degrees in width (or from 1245 to 1275 miles) reach the coasts
    of the American continent over an area which extends from the mouth of
    the Amazon to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>the northern boundary of Florida. Through the agency
    of these mild but almost unvarying forces Columbus was steadily borne
    on to the accomplishment of the greatest event of modern history. The
    companions of the Admiral were dismayed by the persistency with which
    they were wafted beyond the bounds of the known world, and ascribed the
    unceasing east wind, which they supposed offered them no hope of return
    to their homes, to a device of the devil. In one of the houses on the
    island of Guadaloupe Columbus on his second voyage saw the stern-post
    of a vessel, supposed to have been the fragment of some ship that had
    drifted across the Atlantic and been cast, together with the crew, upon
    unknown shores. How often and how long this same process had operated
    it is impossible to conjecture.<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> The accidental discovery of Brazil
    by Cabral furnishes an additional reason for believing that anciently
    vessels may have reached the new world. Pedro Alvarez de Cabral was
    dispatched by the Portuguese on the 9th of March 1500, with a fleet of
    thirteen vessels on a voyage around the Cape of Good Hope, to Calicut.
    After passing the Cape Verde Islands he bore away to the west, in
    order to avoid the calms prevailing on the Guinea coast. On the 25th
    of April, to his surprise he discovered what proved to be the South
    American continent, at a point which he named Porto Securo.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> When
    we consider that the distance from the coast of Africa to Cape Frio,
    Brazil, is but 1530 miles, and realize that twelve centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.
    C.</span> the Phœnicians and probably other maritime peoples of the
    Mediterranean visited Britain at the north and coasted Africa to the
    south, the probabilities are strong that, through the natural agency
    of the Atlantic currents and the trade-winds, some ancient mariners
    reached the American coast.<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span></p>

  <p>Brasseur de Bourbourg, on the authority of Baron de Eckstein and his
    own researches, points to the fact that the Barbarians who are alluded
    to by Homer and Thucydides, are a race of ancient navigators and
    pirates called <i>Cares</i> or <i>Carians</i>, who occupied the islands
    of Greece and a part of the coast of the Peloponnesus, Arcanania and
    Illyria, before the Pelasgi. They ruled in Phrygia and other states
    of Asia Minor, antedating the Phœnicians in their sovereignty of the
    sea and the Indo-European peoples in their domination of the land.
    The same people extended their borders into Nubia and Libya and
    became the ancestors of the nations of the Barbary States. The Abbé,
    to all appearances, easily identifies them with <i>Caracars</i> or
    <i>Caribs</i> of the Antilles, the <i>Caras</i> or <i>Cariari</i> of
    Honduras, and even with the <i>Gurani</i> of South America. We submit
    the question for the investigation of the student, rather than with
    our endorsement.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> Whether a great continent ever existed in the
    Pacific Ocean since man’s appearance on the earth, or whether the great
    area occupied by Oceanica and the Coral Islands of the Central Pacific
    was once a continent, are questions which cannot now be determined.
    It is certain, however, as Professor Dana has shown in his study of
    the atolls and barriers of the Pacific, that if not a continent, at
    least a great archipelago measuring 6000 miles in length by from 1000
    to 2000 miles in breadth, has subsided to a depth ranging from 3000 to
    6000 feet. Professor Dana states that two hundred islands have thus
    been lost.<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> Professor Le Conte estimates the loss of land to equal
    20,000,000 square miles, and defines its boundaries by the Hawaiian
    and Feejee groups, north <span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>and south, and the Paumotu group and Pelews,
    east and west. He fixes the extreme subsidence at 1000 feet, since
    the average height of the high islands of the Pacific at present is
    not less than 9000 feet above the sea level, while some of them reach
    14000 feet.<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> Professor Dana is of the opinion that this vast area
    has subsided since the <i>Tertiary age</i>. Whether such is the case
    or not is a matter of conjecture, but it is certain that much of it
    has been accomplished within the human era. That a higher civilization
    once prevailed throughout Polynesia we need only cite the remains found
    on Easter Island by Captain Cook, and refer to the Appendix of Mr.
    Baldwin’s work, where ruins of a high order are named as existing on
    Ascension, Marshall, Gilbert, Kingsmill, Ladrones, Swallow, Strong’s,
    Navigators and Hawaiian Islands. A quadrangular tower forty feet high
    and several stone-lined canals are to be seen at the harbor at Strong’s
    Island. On the adjoining isle of Lele, cyclopian walls forming large
    enclosures are overgrown by forests. “These walls are twelve feet
    thick, and within are vaults, artificial caverns, and secret passages.”
    “Not more than five hundred people now inhabit these islands; their
    tradition is that an ancient city formerly stood around this harbor,
    mostly on Lele, occupied by a powerful people whom they called ‘Anut,’
    and who had large vessels, in which they made long voyages east and
    west, ‘many moons’ being required for these voyages.”<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> It is
    altogether probable that not only a higher civilization once prevailed
    in Polynesia, but that within the history of man, the greater extent
    of land, now submerged, made the passage to America comparatively
    easy. If we turn to the North Pacific, all doubts vanish in the
    presence of the most favorable conditions for a migration from our
    continent to the other. With Latham, we believe that if America had
    first been discovered from the west, and Alaska and the north-west
    coast been as well known as our Atlantic coast, North-eastern Asia
    would have naturally passed for the <em>fatherland</em> of North-western
    America.<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> It is scarcely <span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>necessary to occupy space in pointing
    out the facilities which the Aleutian Islands offer for a migration
    even in inferior boats, and at all seasons of the year. The climate,
    though cool, is not severe, owing to the proximity of the warm current
    of the Kuro-suvo, and it only requires an inspection of the map to
    convince the most conservative. Col. Barclay Kennon, formerly of the
    United States North Pacific Surveying Expedition, after referring
    to the conspicuousness of the volcano Petropaulski on the shores of
    Kamtschatka, says: “Proceeding along this coast to Cape Kronotski,
    which lies north of Petropaulski, the distance to Behring’s Island is
    about one hundred and fifty miles—course east. Fifteen miles only from
    it is Copper Island, and about one hundred and fifty miles south-west
    of it is Attou Island, the most westerly of the Aleutian group, which
    is an almost unbroken chain, connecting the American continent to the
    peninsula of Alaska.”<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> It is evident that the voyage from the
    Asiatic to the American coast can be made as far south as the Aleutian
    Islands without losing sight of land but a few hours at a time—a matter
    of no consequence to the intrepid navigators found everywhere among
    the aborigines upon the islands and coast.<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> The Kuro-suvo or Japan
    current sweeps along the Asiatic coast, bears away to the east, and
    describing a semicircle, bends its course southward to the shores of
    California and Mexico, until it reaches about the tenth parallel of
    north latitude, when it returns to the Japanese coast.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span></p>

  <p>This Gulf Stream of the Pacific, which nearly every season casts
    wrecks of Japanese junks upon our shores, no doubt has been an
    active agent in giving character to our ancient population.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>
    Added to these twofold facilities for communication—of currents and
    an almost continuous chain of islands—we have a third in the narrow
    channel at Behring’s Straits. These straits, according to Sir John F.
    Herschel, are now “only thirty miles broad where narrowest, and only
    twenty-five fathoms in their greatest depth.”<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> Sir Charles Lyell,
    in alluding to the above fact, remarks: “Behring’s Straits happen to
    agree singularly in width and depth with the Straits of Dover, the
    difference in depth not being more than three or four feet.”<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> With
    this statement before us while standing upon the deck of a vessel
    midway between Calais and Dover, with the shores of France and England
    in full view, we felt, as never before, how absurd is the opinion
    which has been advanced more than once, that no general migration
    was likely to take place across Behring’s Straits. As well say that
    no general migration was likely to take place across the Straits of
    Dover; yet we learn that Britain was known to be inhabited as early
    as the twelfth century <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span><a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> The weather at Behring’s
    Straits, though cold even in summer, is not nearly as cold as the
    winters of Japan.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> In winter the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>waters of the straits are frozen
    over generally as late as April, furnishing a continuous connection
    between the continents, while in summer the communication at present
    between the aborigines inhabiting opposite shores is continuous.<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>
    Frederick von Hellwald furnishes an argument for the naturalness of
    a migration to the American shores the fact that, “while the Asiatic
    projection near Behring’s Straits is almost a sterile rocky waste, the
    opposite coast presents a much more inviting appearance, abounding
    in trees and shrubs. Moreover, the climate when we pass southward of
    the peninsula of Alaska, is of a genial character, the temperature
    continuing nearly the same as far down as Oregon.”<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> The difference
    in the two shores is owing to the fact that the cold current from the
    Arctic Ocean passes southward along the Asiatic coast, while a portion
    of the water of the warm current passes up the American shore.<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>
    It is impossible to approximate the period of the world’s history in
    which the migration must have taken place. No doubt it was in a remote
    age, before the old world peoples had developed their present or even
    historic peculiarities and types of civilization. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>If this be true, the
    futility of all old world comparisons, and the unceasing search for
    analogies which has been going on since the discovery of the continent,
    is at once apparent.<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

  <p>Prof. Grote thinks the first migration may have taken place in the
    Tertiary period in Pliocene time, and that the subsequent advent
    of the ice period cutting off all communication with the old world
    until recent times, produced a modification in the race, and that man
    retired with the glacier on its return to the north, where we see his
    descendants in the Eskimo.<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> If Prof. Croll’s theory of climatic
    change resulting from the maximum eccentricity of the earth’s orbit be
    true, or even if the ordinary time at which the American glacial period
    is supposed to have occurred be taken into consideration, we hardly
    think the evidences of man’s pre-glacial residence on this continent
    are sufficient on which to base a safe hypothesis.<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> Of course Prof.
    Grote would assign a comparatively recent migration to the civilized
    nations. Whether a continuous land communication ever existed between
    the continents at the Aleutian Islands<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> or at Behring’s Straits
    cannot be determined, though the probabilities seem to favor the view
    that they were once united.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span></p>

  <p>Prof. Asa Gray has satisfactorily shown the intimate relationship
    between the North American and Asiatic vegetation, while many of our
    fauna are clearly of Asiatic origin.<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> However, it is of little
    moment in this discussion whether the land bridge ever existed; the
    conditions for migration from one continent to the other are now,
    and no doubt ever have been favorable, and that different peoples at
    different times have availed themselves of those conditions is equally
    certain. We have already alluded to the climatic conditions south of
    Alaska which would naturally allure a migrating tribe down the coast
    to Oregon and the Columbian region. Once there, however, a tribe of
    considerable numbers and enterprise would soon be stimulated to push
    farther, because of the demands for a more ample support than could be
    found on the Pacific coast in the region of the Columbia and Frazier
    Rivers. Still, progress to the south is practically cut off, since
    the dryness and sterility of the Californian coast, the ice-capped
    mountains intervening between the north and the Sacramento and San
    Joaquin rivers and the desert highlands which rise with bleak and
    forbidding aspect between the Sierra Nevada and the eastern Rocky
    Mountains, combine in forming a barrier sufficient to turn the course
    of a migration.<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> Add to this the fact that the country south
    of Oregon rises over 2000 feet above the head of the waters of the
    Columbia and Missouri rivers, and it is apparent that an outlet must be
    sought in another direction. Nature has provided the highway. Alluding
    to this fact and to the unbroken line of mounds from the north and west
    down the Missouri valley, Mr. Becker remarks: “On the head of (canoe)
    navigation we have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>what is known as ‘portages.’ These are depressions
    in the continuous range of the Rocky Mountains of such a nature that
    they fairly invite a travelling tribe to cross from the river system
    of the upper Columbia, emptying into the Pacific Ocean to that of the
    Missouri, on which a canoe need but be floated in order to arrive in
    the far distant Gulf of Mexico. Canoes can easily be carried from
    one river system to the other. Nothing like it exists in the whole
    mountain range southward, until we arrive at Nicaragua Lake in Central
    America.”<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> It will not require long for the matter of fact reader,
    who comprehends the well-nigh insurmountable difficulties which lie in
    the way of populating America in tropical or southern latitudes, and
    compares with them the facilities which the proximity of the continents
    and the topography of our country afford, to determine from what
    quarter America received the greater part of its inhabitants.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">CONCLUSION.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE dim uncertainty which envelopes the most ancient period of American
    antiquity, like that which obscures the beginnings of Egyptian,
    Assyrian and Trojan history, to say nothing of the origin of the
    venerable Asiatic civilizations, renders much of the effort in this
    field unsatisfactory. Still the results are of surpassing interest. A
    new cosmogony, mythology and traditional history full of weird poetic
    inspiration, an inspiration such as is begotten in contemplating the
    struggles of nature’s children after a higher development, is added to
    the fund of human knowledge. The poetry of the Quiché cosmogony must
    some day find expression in verse of Miltonic grandeur. The fall of
    Xibalba will no doubt afford the materials for a heroic poem which will
    stand in the same relation to America that the Iliad does to Greece.
    The doctrines of the benign and saintly Quetzalcoatl or Cukulcan
    must be classed among the great faiths of mankind, and their author,
    alone of all the great teachers of morals except Christ himself,
    inculcating a <em>positive</em> morality, must be granted a precedence
    of most of the great teachers of Chinese and Hindoo antiquity. It is
    the custom of many Europeans to regard America as having no heroic or
    legendary period, no heroes like Achilles, Æneas, Sigfried, Beowolf,
    Arthur and the Cid; but who will review the romance of American
    antiquity and longer entertain this view? A few years ago, writers
    dated North American history from the discoveries made by Columbus
    and his immediate successors. Now they go back to the Northmen for a
    starting-point. May not the beginning be pushed even farther back, and
    the <em>ancient history of America</em> receive the attention of the
    historiographer?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span></p>

  <p>The origin of the North American population cannot be positively
    settled at present, though the probabilities are that new facts will be
    brought to light establishing the relationship of the ancestors of the
    Nahuas with some ancient Asiatic race, as the Eskimo have clearly been
    proven to belong to the Arctic race which encircles the globe near the
    North pole.<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> We have seen that groups of facts unquestionably point
    to Northern Asia as the ancient home of a large share of the tribes of
    North America, civilized and savage. The autochthonic hypothesis which
    had its first great advocate in Dr. Morton, receives no support from
    his mistaken argument for the unity of the American race. We think
    we have shown, as did Prof. Wilson before us, that no such fact as
    ethnic unity exists in America. Dr. Morton’s own measurements of crania
    which we have classified, and the recent measurements of mound skulls,
    disprove the argument which he sought to establish. The autochthonic
    hypothesis owed much of its popularity to the support which it received
    from Prof. Agassiz’s doctrine of the separate creations of races of
    men, a hypothesis which has rapidly lost ground since the decease of
    its eminent advocate. It is impossible to determine whether the people
    of the mounds of the United States were preceded in this country by any
    other people. Certainly they had intercourse with some race having a
    cranial type quite different from their own, as several low-type skulls
    taken from the mounds testify. If the rude weapons found in New Jersey
    are as old as Dr. Abbott supposes<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>—belonging to the inter-glacial
    age—the question of man’s antiquity on this continent may have to
    be viewed in a different light from that in which it has hitherto
    appeared. It is conjectured that this supposed inter-glacial race were
    the ancestors of the Eskimo of to-day, and retired or were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>driven
    to the Arctic regions, where their racial characteristics became
    permanent. The traditional history of both Mayas and Nahuas seem to
    indicate an old world origin. The former people clearly claim an origin
    which, if their traditions are worth anything, must be assigned to some
    Mediterranean country. While, on the contrary, the Nahuas persistently
    state that they came from the north or north-west. It is certain that
    many of their cosmological traditions closely resemble those of Central
    and Western Asiatic peoples. Why should the traditions of the ancient
    Americans be less reliable than those of the most ancient Egyptians,
    Greeks, or Hindoos?<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

  <p>Tradition, language and architectural remains furnish us the data by
    which to trace the migrations of peoples. In addition to the testimony
    of tradition, the languages of the Mayas and Quichés present affinities
    to the west European and African languages; also to the languages
    of the West Indies and the Antilles. Whether the Quiché traditions
    concerning their ancient home have reference to the Atlantic coast of
    the United States is uncertain, though Señor Orozco y Berra believes
    their ancestors to have migrated from Florida to Cuba and thence
    to Yucatan. Linguistic and architectural evidences show that the
    Maya-Quiché family extended its civilization north as far as Panuco,
    and south as far as Honduras.</p>

  <p>The Nahua migrations are more numerous and their accounts somewhat
    obscure. It is not improbable that while few in number the Nahuas
    arrived on our north-western coast, where they found a home until they
    had become a tribe of considerable proportions. Crossing the watershed
    between the sources of the Columbia and Missouri Rivers, a large
    portion of the tribe probably found its way to the Mississippi and
    Ohio Valleys, where it laid the foundations of a wide-spread empire,
    and developed a civilization which reached a respectable degree of
    advancement.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span></p>

  <p>The remainder of the Nahuas, we think, instead of crossing the
    Rocky Mountains, migrated southward into Utah, and established a
    civilization the remains of which are seen in the cliff-dwellings
    of the San Juan Valley and such extensive ruins as exist at Aztec
    Springs. It must be conceded that this hypothesis rests on linguistic
    and traditional evidence, as no affinity between the architecture
    of the Cliff-dwellers and either the Mexicans or Mound-builders is
    traceable. We have in a preceding chapter summarized our reasons for
    considering the Mound-builders to have been Nahuas. The Olmecs, the
    first Nahuas to reach Mexico, came in ships from the direction of
    Florida, landed at Panuco, and journeyed southward until they came in
    contact with the advanced and already old civilization of the Mayas.
    The Toltecs came into Mexico by land from the North. The Chichimecs,
    their former neighbors in Hue hue Tlapalan, whether Nahuas or not
    originally, followed them and adopted their language. The Nahuatlaca
    tribes, speaking the same language, arrived centuries afterward from
    the same quarter—the North. Finally the Aztecs, the last of the Nahuas,
    reached Anáhuac four centuries before the Spanish conquest. Mr. Becker
    has conjectured that Aztlan (land of whiteness) was the name applied
    to the southern Mississippi Valley and the region of the Gulf States;
    that Hue hue Tlapalan (old red land), the ancient empire of the Nahuas,
    was situated on the great plains of the west and in the region occupied
    by the Cliff-dwellers and Pueblos, and further, that the “seven caves”
    or “ravines,” the Tulan Zuiva of the Quichés, is the region of the
    Colorado River, the land of cañons.</p>

  <p>At best these can be but conjectures, yet the probabilities are
    that Hue hue Tlapalan bordered upon the great Mississippi Valley.
    Traditional and architectural evidence lead us to this conclusion. The
    linguistic argument is wanting, except the statement of the historians
    that the people of the Floridian region spoke Nahua. It remains for
    some one to compare the Aztec with the languages of the southern
    Indians before the investigation is complete. While the probability is
    pre-eminent that the ancient Americans are of old world origin and that
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span> Mayas and Nahuas reached this continent from opposite directions,
    it is certain that the civilization developed by each people is
    indigenous—that it grew up on the soil where we find it, and was shaped
    by the wants of man as influenced and modified by the conditions of
    nature and physical surroundings. The most persistent investigation has
    failed to disclose any marked resemblance between the architecture,
    art, religion and customs of the North Americans considered as a whole
    and of any old world people. It is true that occasional analogies
    suggest intercourse and even relationship with particular races, as
    for instance the serpent and phallus worship common to the aboriginal
    Americans and the people of India. Sun-worship, so wide-spread, may
    also indicate an ancient community of residence for those peoples who
    practise it. The Calendar systems of Mayas and Nahuas present analogies
    to the systems employed by the Persians, Egyptians and certain
    Asiatic nations, and the presumption is very strong that the latter
    furnished the ground-plan upon which the Nahua system was constructed.
    The accuracy of the Aztec calendar must ever be a monument to their
    intellectual culture, and an undeniable proof of the advanced state of
    ancient Mexican civilization. The fact that Cortez found the Julian
    reckoning, employed by his own and every other European nation, to be
    more than ten days in error when tried by the Aztec system—a system
    the almost perfect accuracy of which was proven by the adjustments
    which took place under Gregory XIII in 1582 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>—excites our
    wonder and admiration. How the Nahuas, whether Toltec or Aztec we know
    not, were able to approximate the true length of the year within two
    minutes and nine seconds, thus almost rivalling the accuracy of the
    learned astronomers of the Caliph Almamon, is a mystery. The venerable
    civilization of the Mayas, whose forest-grown cities and crumbling
    temples hold entombed a history of vanished glory, no doubt belongs to
    the remotest period of North American antiquity. It was old when the
    Nahuas, then a comparatively rude people, first came in contact with
    it, adopted many of its features, and engrafted upon it new life. Like
    Rome, overwhelmed by the Teutons of the North, it no doubt succumbed
    to the vigorous aggressions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span> of the invaders, and was compelled to
    resign the dominion of much of its northern territory. The powerful
    empire of the Quiché-Cakchiquels was the result of the union of the
    old and new races. The otherwise inviting picture of ancient American
    civilization is marred by the introduction of human sacrifices which
    in each instance occurred in the period of the political decadence
    of the people practising it, and no doubt was the most potent factor
    in the downfall of both Toltec and Aztec monarchies. Still, when we
    reflect upon the Druidical horrors of the Britons at the time of the
    Roman conquest, and realize that our Anglo-Saxon ancestors in the sixth
    century sold their relatives and even their own children into slavery,
    and were but slightly removed from the condition of cannibals if they
    were not actually such, the ancient American civilization with its many
    humane features and advanced culture rises up in splendor before us, in
    marked contrast with our barbarous origin. Although this civilization
    was indigenous and peculiar to itself, we find all of the American
    tribes possessed of certain arts and traditions which seem common to
    mankind in all parts of the world. The character of flint weapons and
    implements are the same among all primitive peoples. The modes of
    producing fire by friction and of grinding grain differ little, if
    any, in America, from those employed by ancient peoples elsewhere. The
    first efforts toward the development of the architectural idea all
    round the globe, seem to find expression in the rude mound and then in
    the more perfect pyramid. These and other considerations which have
    been noted in the preceding pages, lead us to the conclusion that at a
    remote period, before racial and national characteristics had been well
    defined, this continent received its population from the old world, at
    different times and from different quarters.</p>

  <p>The uniformity with which the human mind operates in all lands for the
    accomplishment of certain ends, has in many instances resulted in the
    independent development of institutions common to several peoples. This
    fact, together with the probability that occasionally foreigners were
    cast upon the American shores, will be sufficient to account for many
    features which have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span> been discovered in Mexican and Central American
    architecture, art, and religion, presenting analogies with the old
    world. The fact that civilizations having such analogies are developed
    in isolated quarters of the globe, separated from each other by broad
    seas and lofty mountains, and thus indicating a uniformity of mental
    operation and a unity of mental inspiration, added to the fact that the
    evidence is of a preponderating character that the American continent
    received its population from the old world, leads us to the truth that
    God “hath made of one blood all nations of men.”</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MADISONVILLE EXPLORATIONS.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">SINCE the greater part of this work was put in type, the exploration
    of ancient mounds in several localities in the United States has
    yielded gratifying results. Most conspicuous for rich returns,
    both in pottery and human remains, are the researches which have
    recently been prosecuted with such rare intelligence and vigor by
    the Literary and Scientific Society of Madisonville, Ohio, in the
    aboriginal burying-grounds and among the mound-works of the Little
    Miami Valley. Through the liberality of the society and the courtesy
    of its secretary, Mr. Frank W. Langdon, we are enabled to present
    an authorized account of the explorations. We take this opportunity
    of expressing our obligations to the society, and especially to Mr.
    Langdon, who has kindly prepared the following report:</p>

  <p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Notice of Some Recent Archæological Discoveries in the Little
    Miami Valley.</span> <cite>By <span class="smcap">Frank W. Langdon</span>, Secretary of the
    Literary and Scientific Society of Madisonville, Ohio.</cite></p>

  <p>The valley of the Little Miami River, in South-western Ohio, has long
    been noted for the number and extent of its pre-historic earthworks,
    which, distributed on either side of the river, from its confluence
    with the Ohio to the well-known Fort Ancient and beyond, form an almost
    continuous chain of mounds, forts, circles, and embankments, extending
    for more than fifty miles, and constituting an important division of
    the great earthworks system of the Mississippi Valley.</p>

  <p>Of the few publications relating more especially to the ancient works
    of this series, one of the most important, perhaps, is the paper by
    Dr. Charles L. Metz, entitled “The Prehistoric Monuments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span> of the
    Little Miami Valley,”<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> accompanied by a chart showing the location
    and character of more than forty of these earthworks, situated in
    Columbia, Spencer and Anderson Townships of Hamilton County. The Hon.
    Joseph Cox, H. B. Whetsel, Esq., Mr. Charles F. Low, and the several
    other gentlemen composing the organization known as the Literary and
    Scientific Society of Madisonville, have also, at various times,
    given considerable attention to archæological investigations in this
    vicinity, and the valuable and interesting collections of objects
    of pre-historic art accumulated by these gentlemen afford abundant
    evidence of the long-continued occupation of this region by a numerous
    and somewhat intelligent people of whom we have no historic record.</p>

  <p>A renewed interest in the subject has been recently developed by the
    discovery, near Madisonville, of one of the cemeteries of this unknown
    people, and the explorations therein by the above-named society, are
    perhaps among the most interesting that have ever been conducted in the
    Mississippi Valley.</p>

  <p>This cemetery, which is distant about one and one-half miles south-east
    from Madisonville, occupies the western extremity of an elevated
    plateau overlooking the Little Miami River, and situated from eighty
    to one hundred feet above the water-line. It is bounded on the south
    by the river “bottom”; on the north and west by a deep ravine, through
    which flows a small stream known as Whisky Run; on the east the plateau
    slopes gradually up to the general level of the surrounding country,
    of which it is in fact a continuation or spur, its character of an
    isolated plateau being derived from its position between the eroded
    river valley and the deep ravine above referred to. The precipitous
    but well-wooded bluff which forms the southern limit of this plateau
    extends eastward, facing the river, for perhaps half a mile, and
    distributed along its edge are a number of mounds and other earthworks;
    at its base are the Cincinnati and Eastern and Little Miami Railways,
    the nearest station being Batavia Junction, distant about half a mile
    east of the cemetery.</p>

  <p>The original forest still covers the site of the cemetery, and
    measurements of some of the principal trees are recorded by Dr. Metz
    in his paper before mentioned, as follows: a walnut, 15½ feet in
    circumference; an oak, 12 feet; a maple, 9½ feet; an elm, 12 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>feet. The
    locality has long been known to local collectors and others interested
    in archæological matters, as the “Pottery Field,” so called on account
    of the numerous fragments of earthenware strewn over the surface; and
    it was until recently supposed to be a place where the manufacture of
    pottery had been carried on by the ancient inhabitants of the valley,
    the fragments found being considered the <i>debris</i>. A few scattered
    human remains had also been found in the adjoining ravines, but it was
    not until some time in March, 1879, that its true character and extent
    as a cemetery were brought to light.</p>

  <p>It then became apparent that some concerted action would be necessary,
    in order to secure the best scientific results from the discovery; and
    early in April excavations were begun under the auspices of the before
    mentioned organization, the proprietors of the premises, Messrs. A.
    J. and Charles K. Ferris, having kindly granted to it the exclusive
    privilege of making a thorough and systematic exploration of the
    ground. From that time until the present (July 19, 1879) excavations
    have been continued with a force varying from one to three men,
    assisted by members of the society, every foot of the ground gone over
    being thoroughly explored, and full notes taken as the work progressed.</p>

  <p>The following brief outline of the results, taken from the records of
    the society, will but serve to convey an idea of the general features
    of the discovery and of its importance to archæological science, time
    and space not permitting a detailed account in the present connection.</p>

  <p>Of the four or five acres of ground over which the cemetery is believed
    to extend, only a small segment of the south-western portion has been
    explored. The exploration, however, has been exceedingly thorough and
    comprises an extent of perhaps half an acre of ground, from which have
    been exhumed in all one hundred and eighty-five skeletons. Of these,
    however, but a small proportion are in a good or even tolerable state
    of preservation, as with the utmost care only about forty crania could
    be preserved sufficiently well for measurement. The preservation of
    even this number must probably be attributed to the favorable character
    of the soil, a compact gravelly drift, as the various surroundings,
    position of some skeletons under large trees, etc., all indicate for
    these interments a remote antiquity.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span></p>

  <p>With respect to the mode of burial, this is far from being uniform. A
    large majority of the skeletons are found at a depth of from two to
    three feet, in a horizontal position, face upwards; but exceptions
    to this rule are numerous, many interments being made in a sitting
    position, and some in groups of from three to six individuals
    irregularly disposed. There has been no attempt in any instance at
    the construction of a stone coffin, but in one case the skeleton was
    covered with a layer of small flat limestone from the adjacent stream.
    The heads of those in the horizontal position are generally directed to
    the east or south-east; but this rule is not constant, several being
    found at right angles to these. It is worthy of note, however, that,
    with scarcely an exception, those skeletons accompanied by the finer
    vases, pipes and other choice relics, have their heads directed east or
    south-east.</p>

  <p>During the progress of the work on April 12, a cranium, unaccompanied
    by other bones, was exhumed; in searching for the rest of the
    skeleton, a circular excavation, three and a half feet in diameter
    and four and a half feet in depth, was made, from which were taken
    bones sufficient to represent twenty-two skeletons. But two of the
    crania, both evidently those of females, could be preserved; they are
    remarkable for their whiteness and smooth texture as compared with the
    average crania from this cemetery. A sacrum taken from this pit has
    imbedded in its anterior surface, near the promontory, one of the small
    triangular flints known as “war arrows,” which had passed obliquely
    from above downwards, and to the right, necessarily penetrating the
    abdominal walls and viscera in order to reach its final lodging place.
    The bottom of the pit was paved with the common river mussel shells
    (<i>unios</i>), and there appeared to have been some attempt at a
    natural disposition of the bones, those of the lower extremities being
    placed at the bottom, the crania at the top.</p>

  <p>Among the human remains from this cemetery are many possessing features
    of surgical and anatomical interest, as, for instance, an adult male
    cranium in which complete anchylosis of the atlas to the condyles
    has occurred, the posterior arch remaining free. Other crania show
    evidences of severe injury with subsequent repair, and among the long
    bones are several showing characteristic lesions strongly indicative
    of rachitis and of syphilis, a fact of considerable interest in its
    relation to the geographical distribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span> of the latter disease, and
    also as bearing on the theory of its introduction into Southern Europe
    from America in the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p>Among the graves opened are several of children, who are usually buried
    in close proximity to adults, and with them are found various ornaments
    or toys of perforated shell, bone, etc., as well as small earthen
    vessels.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap0">Bowl from Ancient Cemetery, Little Miami Valley.</span><br>
      (Collection of W. C. Rogers, Madisonville, O.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The pottery ware which accompanies the skeletons is usually situated
    near the head and presents many features of special interest. It is
    made of clay, finely tempered with pounded unio shells, and much care
    has evidently been bestowed upon its manufacture, some pieces being
    scarcely thicker than an ordinary teacup. Many specimens are in a
    perfect condition, or nearly so, and they usually contain a single
    unio shell when found, the shell being evidently intended for use as a
    spoon. The vessels range in capacity from a third of a pint, or even
    smaller, up to a gallon or more, the smaller ones, as before stated,
    being usually found in the graves of children. They are symmetrical
    in shape and varied in design, some being artistically ornamented
    with scroll work, handles representing lizards, human heads, etc.,
    and are almost invariably provided with four handles. Among the
    few exceptions to this latter rule is an eight-handled bowl (see
    cut), in the collection of W. C. Rogers, Esq., which is a two-story
    affair, apparently made by combining two distinct vessels, and then
    removing the bottom of the upper one. Vessels having but two handles
    occasionally occur, and others with holes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span> lieu of handles; but
    these are exceptions to the general rule as above noted.</p>

  <p>The total number of vessels taken from the cemetery to date is
    eighty-eight. There is good reason to believe, however, that each
    interment has been originally accompanied by a vessel, the present
    disparity between the number of vessels and the number of skeletons
    being accounted for by the fragments thickly strewn over the surface
    and intermingled with the surrounding soil, which have doubtless at one
    time constituted portions of the missing burial urns. To the growth
    of trees, action of frost and rooting of hogs, the destruction of so
    much of this valuable ware must be attributed, and to the latter cause,
    irregularities observed in the disposition of some of the skeletons are
    probably due.</p>

  <p>Among the other articles of utility or ornament found in the graves
    are twelve pipes, of various patterns, three of them being made from
    the Minnesota Catlinite or Red Pipestone; also stone disks, axes
    and chisels, flint knives and spear-heads, and many ornaments and
    implements of bone, such as beads, awls, needles, perforated teeth,
    etc., together with others of unknown uses. Two small cylinders of
    rolled copper, about two inches in length, and two flat pieces of the
    same metal an inch or more square, are among the collections, as are
    also two stones bearing inscriptions as follows: one, an irregular
    piece of sandstone, measuring about 3 × 2 × 1 inches, on the flat
    surface of which are cut two parallel figures made of straight lines
    and apparently intended to represent arrows; this specimen is now in
    the writer’s collection. The other stone, which is in the collection of
    E. A. Conkling, Esq., is a flattened dark-green boulder measuring about
    3½ × 2½ inches, one side of which is completely covered with a network
    of lines from ⅛ to ¼ of an inch apart and crossing each other at nearly
    right angles, thus forming quadrangular divisions of various sizes.</p>

  <p>An interesting feature of these excavations has been the discovery of
    what may be designated as “ashpits”; being circumscribed deposits of
    ashes, shells, sand, etc., from two to three feet in thickness, placed
    at varying distances below the surface. A perpendicular section made
    of one of these pits answers to the following description, which will
    serve to convey a fair idea of them all. Diameter of pit, three feet;
    the first eighteen inches consisted of leaf mold and sandy soil; then
    followed nine inches of clay, burnt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span> earth and charcoal; next, ashes
    and charcoal, twelve inches; clay, three inches; white ashes, two
    inches; sand and unio shells, six inches; pure ashes, twelve inches;
    total depth, five feet two inches.</p>

  <p>Of these ashpits, more than fifty have been opened, situated in
    continuous rows near the edge of the bluff. They are quite uniform in
    size, measuring from three to four feet in diameter and from four to
    six feet in depth, and with one or two exceptions have not been found
    in any other than the above-mentioned situation. Intermingled with the
    ashes are pipes, implements of bone, shell, and stone, a mastodon’s
    tooth, bones of various wild animals, including birds and fishes, and
    in some of them large sherds of pottery-ware indicating vessels of from
    ten to twelve gallons capacity or even larger. With the exception of a
    single dorsal vertebra no human remains have yet been found in these
    pits, unless the ashes be so considered.</p>

  <p>From the uncharred condition of the above articles it is evident that
    the ashes have been placed in the pits <em>as ashes</em>, after having
    been burned elsewhere, as in no case do the relics or the walls of the
    pits show any traces of the action of fire.</p>

  <p>With respect to the length of time that has elapsed since these
    interments, mention has already been made of the situation of some of
    the skeletons under large trees, an instance of which may be cited: On
    Saturday, April 5, the ground was visited by Judge Cox and Mr. Low,
    in company with Dr. Metz, and in excavating beneath an oak tree, six
    feet two inches in circumference, a skeleton was discovered, its lower
    extremities extending under the tree; overlying the lower extremities
    of this skeleton was another, its body situated directly under the
    trunk of the tree and the skull so surrounded and penetrated by roots
    as to prevent its removal except in fragments. The bones of both
    skeletons were much decayed and exceedingly fragile.</p>

  <p>In forming an estimate as to the probable antiquity of these
    interments, the time that must necessarily have elapsed between the
    abandonment of the cemetery and the springing up of the forest; the age
    of the trees now present and of others that have fallen and decayed;
    the advanced state of decay in which the human remains are found; the
    character of the pottery-ware; and lastly, the total absence of any
    evidences of communication with civilization, in the shape of glass
    beads or other trinkets, must all be taken into account; and it does
    not appear at all unreasonable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span> to conclude that the use of this ground
    as a cemetery probably antedates the discovery of America by Columbus.</p>

  <p>As regards the particular race to which this people belonged,—whether
    they were identical with, or related to, the celebrated “stone-grave
    people” of Tennessee,<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> as some of their pottery-ware and the shape
    and dimensions of their crania would seem to indicate; or whether they
    were the last remnants of the once powerful nation that erected Fort
    Ancient and other gigantic works in this region,—these and similar
    queries remain as yet unanswered. More extended investigations and a
    careful comparison of large amounts of material from this and other
    localities, may be expected to assist in the solution of these obscure
    but interesting problems.</p>

  <p>At the present writing excavations are still in progress, with new
    developments daily, and a publication of the entire results, with full
    details and illustrations, may be looked for in due season.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE question as to whether man and the mastodon were contemporaneous in
    America, has long been a matter of dispute as the reader is aware after
    the perusal of our second chapter and other sources. The “elephant

    </span>
    pipe” figured in the accompanying cut has been the means of calling
    fresh attention to the subject. Dr. R. J. Farquharson, of the Davenport
    Academy of Sciences, who kindly furnished us the photo from which our
    illustration is a reduction, states that six or seven years ago Mr.
    Peter Mare, a farmer (whose estate was situated on both <span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>sides of the
    line dividing Muscatine and Louisa Counties, Iowa) found the elephant
    pipe while plowing corn on his land in Louisa County. The finder,
    who had no idea of its archæological value, kept it with a number of
    “Indian stones,” as he termed them, until last year (1878), when it
    became the property of the Davenport Academy. Dr. Farquharson says:
    “The ancient mounds were very abundant in that vicinity (Louisa Co.),
    and rich in relics which are deposited on the surface of the soil (not
    in excavations), as we found in exploring a number. In such a case
    it is not strange that a mound having been gradually removed by long
    cultivation, the relics so deposited should be reached and turned up
    by the plow.” * * * “The pipe, which is of a fragile sandstone, is of
    the ordinary Mound-builder’s type, and has every appearance of age and
    usage. Of its genuineness I have no doubt. Together with the ‘Elephant
    mound’ of Wisconsin, the elephant head of Palenque (depicted in Lord
    Kingsborough’s great work), our pipe completes the series of what the
    French would call ‘documents’ proving the fact of the contemporaneous
    existence on this continent of man and the mastodon.”<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> The above
    facts, as stated by Dr. Farquharson, were substantially embodied in a
    paper read by Mr. Pratt before the Davenport Academy, April 25, 1879.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE CHARNAY EXPLORATION.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE exploring expedition under French and American patronage, led by
    M. Désiré Charnay, began its labors in Mexico, May 1st, 1880, and
    continued them nearly a year. During this time a large number of ruins,
    scattered over the area extending from Teotihuacan and Tollan, on the
    north, and Palenque, on the south, are reported to have been examined.
    How thorough the examination was, or how scientifically accurate
    were the published reports, it would at present (September, 1881) be
    impossible to determine. Suffice it to say that they are generally
    viewed with distrust, partly on account of the disjointed, haphazard
    form in which they have appeared in the <cite>North American Review</cite>
    (September, 1880-June, 1881—doubtless without blame on the part of the
    editor), where the splendid heliotype illustrations have been rendered
    nearly valueless by the frequent omission, from the text and elsewhere,
    of descriptive reference; and partly on account of the over-confident
    style of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>writer. It is to be hoped that the ground for criticism
    may be removed when M. Charnay shall formally publish his reports.</p>

  <p>It would be superfluous in this connection to summarize his work, since
    his papers are accessible to all.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note, however, that he reports Teotihuacan, on the
    authority of several authors, to have contained twenty-seven thousand
    dwellings, besides its temples, and that the heaps of ruins which
    remain justify the statement. The whole area of five or six miles
    in diameter was found covered with heaps of ruins. Cement roadways,
    containing broken pottery, seemed to afford evidence of occupancy
    in even a more ancient epoch than that in which Teotihuacan was
    founded. Excavations revealed two halls of a supposed temple at the
    base of one of the pyramids. One of these halls is reported to be
    nearly fifty feet square, in the middle of which stood six pillars
    which had served to sustain the roof. At Tula, the ancient capital of
    Tollau, north-west of the city of Mexico, hitherto so fruitless of
    archæological, and especially of architectural remains, M. Charnay
    made remarkable discoveries of pyramids, and several Toltec houses of
    immense proportions, one of which contained forty-three apartments,
    besides corridors and a staircase. Sculptures were numerous, and bricks
    of burnt clay, twelve inches long by five inches wide, were found to
    have been used in constructing stairways.</p>

  <p>Near the village of Comalcalco, thirty-five or forty miles
    north-west of San Juan Bautista, the capital of Tabasco, vast ruins
    were discovered, particularly pyramids, towers, and edifices, all
    forest-grown, equalling and even surpassing in proportions those at
    Palenque. Upon a pyramid 115 feet high an edifice of brick and mortar
    234 feet in length was explored.</p>

  <p>At the village of Palenque, M. Charnay found the two bas-reliefs seen
    by Waldeck and Stephens a half century ago, now built into the outer
    wall of a church (see this work, p. 391).</p>

  <p>At the ancient city itself the explorer discovered the ruins to be
    more extensive than ever heretofore supposed, and estimates that it
    would require the labor of five hundred men for six months, under the
    direction of a corps of topographers, simply to determine the general
    plan of the city. Eight hundred and sixty-one square feet of casts of
    bas-reliefs were taken. It was ascertained at Palenque, by breaking off
    portions of the vesture upon the stucco reliefs, that the human body
    had in all cases been first carefully modeled, and that the drapery had
    subsequently been superposed. Whether this fact throws light simply
    upon the process employed, or indicates a reaction or evolution in art,
    is equally interesting and uncertain.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="subheadc">HOUSE ARCHITECTURE OF THE MOUND-BUILDERS AND PUEBLOS.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AMONG the unsolved problems of American archæology is that of the
    use to which the extensive systems of embankments attributed to the
    Mound-builders were put. The Newark (Ohio) system of works, now
    covering two miles square, but formerly presenting twelve miles of
    embankment, reaching at some points a height of thirty-five feet,
    with sufficient width for a carriage-way on top, has been a veritable
    sphinx to all inquirers. Nor does it stand alone in an architectural
    aspect. Its square is precisely of the dimensions of a similar figure
    found at Hopetown, in the Scioto Valley. Its circles are connected
    with squares or octagons, a typical combination of features generally
    prevalent in mound structures. Furthermore, its trenches are all within
    the enclosures. The probability is that the clew to the solution of
    the problem has come to light. The discovery of what are pronounced
    to be mound-works, in connection with the Pueblo ruins of Colorado
    and New Mexico and Arizona, has given us the hint. Mr. Wm. H. Holmes
    in “A Notice of the Ancient Ruins of South-western Colorado, examined
    during the Summer of 1875,”<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> shows us the Mound and Pueblo ruin in
    close proximity. In describing a ruined village on the Rio La Plata,
    he says: “North of this, about 300 feet, is a truncated rectangular
    mound, 9 or 10 feet in height and 50 feet in width by 80 in length.
    On the east end, near one of the angles, is a low, projecting pile
    of débris that may have been a tower. There is nothing whatever to
    indicate the use of this structure. Its flat top and height give it
    more the appearance of one of the sacrificial mounds of the Ohio Valley
    than any other observed in this part of the West. It may have been,
    however, only a raised foundation, designed to support a superstructure
    of wood or adobe.... South of this, and occupying the extreme southern
    end of the terrace, are a number of small circles and mounds, while
    an undetermined number of diminutive mounds are distributed among the
    other ruins.” Mr. W. H. Jackson, in the same document (p. 29) that
    contains Mr. Holmes’ report, mentions the remains of “many circular
    towns” <span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>on a high plateau between the Montezuma and the Hovenweep. The
    year following, the lamented scholar, Mr. Lewis H. Morgan, acting on
    the suggestion or originating a hypothesis of his own, announced in the
    <cite>North American Review</cite> for July, 1876, what has since been called
    his “Pueblo Theory.” A fuller exposition of his views were embodied
    in his paper “On Houses of the American Aborigines,” published in the
    <cite>Report of the Archæological Institute of America for 1879–1880</cite>.
    Mr. Morgan illustrates the prevalence of communal houses among the
    aborigines east of the Mississippi, citing the long houses of the
    Iroquois; and west of the river the communal lodges of the Minnitares
    and Mandans, and of Columbia River Indians seen by Lewis and Clark in
    1805. The writer further illustrates the communal architecture of the
    aborigines by discussions relating to the joint tenement houses of the
    Pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona. Having thus laid his foundation, he
    applies the communal idea and its expression in the Mandan and Pueblo
    structures in a conjectural restoration of the mound villages. He
    supposes that, as adobe would not withstand the frosts and rains of
    the Ohio Valley, the Mound-builder people resorted to the structure of
    wooden edifices. He says: “They might have raised these embankments
    of earth, enclosing circular, rectangular, or square areas, and
    constructed their long houses upon them.” Mr. Morgan would build upon
    the squares and circles houses having a wooden framework, upon which
    turf and grass were placed both upon roof and sides. In order that this
    should be possible, the sides are supposed to have been inclined at the
    same angle with the embankment, the superstructure being a continuation
    of the earthern foundation so far as outline and geometrical figure
    is concerned. To preserve analogy with the closed, windowless
    ground-storey of New Mexico Pueblos, Mr. Morgan supposes that the
    outer side or sides of the edifice were closed, presenting only blank
    walls of heavy turf or gravel to view; while the walls facing within
    the enclosure were windowed, and pierced with doors. The entrances to
    the enclosures, he supposes, were guarded with palisades. There the
    defensive feature of the Pueblo house was preserved. In his elaborate
    work, the “Houses and House Life of the American Aborigines,”<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> that
    last touch of a vanished hand, the author has discussed at length the
    development of the joint tenement house among the Mound-builders. After
    illustrating the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>principle, as applied in the restoration of High Bank
    works (Ross County, Ohio), he adds: “These embankments, therefore,
    require triangular houses of the kind described, and long houses as
    well, covering their entire length. But the interior plan might have
    been different; for example, the passage-way might have a long exterior
    wall, and the stalls or apartments on the court side, and but half as
    many in number; and, instead of one continuous house, in the interior,
    450 feet in length, it might have been divided into several, separated
    from each other by cross partitions. The plan of life, however, which
    we are justified in ascribing to them, from known usages of Indian
    tribes in a similar condition of advancement, would lead us to expect
    large households formed on the basis of kin, with the practice of
    communism in living in each household, whether large or small.” The
    plausibility of Mr. Morgan’s hypothesis is, to say the least, striking.
    However, his supposition that the Mound-builders and Pueblos were of
    the same race, is not unattended with difficulties. Conspicuous among
    them is the marked dissimilarity of the ceramic ornament employed by
    the two peoples. Nothing is more stable than the art of a race or
    age. Nothing more truly reveals the inner life of a people than its
    pottery. The Mound-builders and Pueblos each had their ceramic types.
    But they were wholly unlike—apparently the work of unrelated races.
    Yet, community of burial, as well as community of residence, to which
    may be added similarity of cranial type, are facts that declare for Mr.
    Morgan’s hypothesis as to the relation of the peoples in question.<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

      <a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Prof. Jos. Leidy, in <cite>Hayden’s 6th Ann. Report of
        the U. S. Geological Survey of the Territories</cite> (1872), pp.
        652–3, describes the stone implements found in the Bridger basin in
        southern Wyoming. He remarks, “The question arises, who made the stone
        implements and when, and why should they occur in such great numbers in
        the particular localities indicated. My friend, Dr. J. Van A. Carter,
        residing at Fort Bridger, and well acquainted with the language,
        history, manners, and customs of the neighboring tribes of Indians,
        informs me that they know nothing about them. He reports that the
        Shoshones look upon them as the gift of God to their ancestors. They
        were no doubt made long ago, some probably at a comparatively late
        date, that is to say, just prior to communication of the Indians with
        the whites, but others probably date centuries back.”

      <a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> It would be foreign to the object of this work to enter
        upon a discussion of the antiquity of man in Europe. Were we to follow
        the example of several writers on the antiquities of America, we might
        present a resumé of the splendid achievements of science in determining
        the approximate age of man, as an inhabitant of different portions of
        the old world, but such condensed accounts at best are unsatisfactory
        and often detrimental to science because of their very slenderness. The
        evidences of man’s antiquity being far more remote than the generally
        accepted historic period, antedating its beginning by several thousand
        years, no doubt exist. The discoveries in the Liége caverns, in the
        caves of Languedoc and in the cave of Engihoul in Belgium; in the
        Neanderthal and Engis caves; at Abbeville and Amians; the valley of the
        Somme; the basin of the Seine; of the Thames; and of the lake dwellers
        of Switzerland, as well as the shell-heaps of Denmark, point to an
        antiquity which half a century ago it would have been heresy to have
        dreamed of. We have but to refer to the admirable work of Sir Charles
        Lyell: <cite>The Antiquity of Man</cite> (Phil., 1863), and to the well-known
        works of Lubbock, Tylor, Vogt, and others. A good treatment of the
        subject in brief will be found in Foster: <cite>Pre-Historic Races of the
        U. S.</cite> (1873), and a pointed and popular reference to it in Bryant’s
        <cite>History of the U. S.</cite>, vol. I. N. Y., 1876.
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> <cite>Evidences of the Antiquity of Man in the U. S.</cite>,
        by Col. Charles Whittlesey. A memoir of 20 pp. Perhaps the chief
        importance of the above-cited cave discoveries is derived from the
        eminence of the antiquarian who cites them, rather than in their real
        value to science. In the case of the Elyria cave—examined by Dr. E.
        W. Hubbard, Prof. J. Brainerd, and the author of the memoir—“the
        grindstone grit,” resting on shale, formed a grotto of considerable
        size. Four feet of the floor of the cave, consisting of charcoal, ashes
        and bones of the wolf, bear, deer, rabbit, squirrels, fishes, snakes
        and birds (“all of which existed in this region when it became known
        to the whites”), was removed and three human skeletons discovered. The
        author states that the three had been crushed by a large slab of the
        overhanging sandstone falling on them, but fails to state how much of
        the overlying material consisted of this sandstone slab. He remarks:
        “Judging from the appearance of the bones, and the depth of the
        accumulations over them, two thousand years may have elapsed since the
        human skeletons were laid on the floor of this cave.” The Louisville
        cave discovery is no more satisfactory than the above. It is scarcely
        necessary to remark that all the evidences are of a comparatively
        recent interment, and much less than two thousand years would have been
        sufficient to produce the conditions described. See also discoveries
        at High Rock Spring, Saratoga, N. Y., cited by Col. Whittlesey, p. 10,
        and more fully treated by Dr. McGuire in the “<cite>Proceedings of the
        Boston Soc. of Nat. Hist.</cite>,” vol. xii, p. 398, May, 1839, in which
        the latter claims to find traces of the Red man 5470 years ago. It is
        not probable that Dr. McGuire’s <em>traces</em> are those of the Indians,
        nor is it certain that they were left by human beings at all, since the
        pine tree (found at a considerable depth and worn as he supposes by the
        feet of Indians) was as liable to have been worn by the feet of animals
        as of men. See also Dr. Abbott, <cite>The Stone Age in New Jersey</cite>,
        Smithsonian Report, 1874, p. 246 <i>et seq.</i> See this work, pp. 127–8.

        in diameter at the base, at the southern end of the prairie, about
        twenty-five miles from Olympia; and scattered over the prairie for a
        distance of fifteen miles are many smaller mounds, not more than four
        feet high and twenty or thirty in diameter. * * * A few days ago one
        of the engineers of the Northern Pacific Railroad opened one of them
        and found the remains of pottery; and a more thorough examination of
        others revealed other curious relics, evidently the work of human
        hands; in fact, in every mound that has yet been opened there is some
        relic of a long-forgotten race discovered.” In quoting the above, Dr.
        Foster remarks that the great mound was no doubt a natural eminence
        artificially rounded off.

        seven feet high above the level, and many thousands in number. Being
        anxious to ascertain if they contained any relics, I subsequently

        The proof is conclusive that the head-waters of the Missouri was one
        of their ancient seats. The same gentleman (Mr. Barrandt) describes
        a remarkable mound in Lincoln County, Dakota, situated eighty-five
        miles north-west of Sioux City, on the west fork of the Little Sioux
        of Dakota or Turkey Creek. The mound is known as the “Hay Stack.”
        Its dimensions are 327 feet in length at the base on the north-west
        side, and 290 on the south-east side, and 120 feet wide. It slopes
        at an angle of about 50°, is from thirty-four to forty feet in
        height, the north-east end being the higher. To the summit, which is
        from twenty-eight to thirty-three feet wide, there is a well-beaten
        path. The remarkable feature of the mound is the fact that part of
        the north-east side is walled up with soft sandstone and limestone,
        brought a distance of at least three miles from an ancient quarry. The
        remainder of the surface is pronounced to be of calcined clay. The
        mound contained a large interior circular chamber, in which the bones
        of animals, thirty-six pieces of pottery, and a mass of charcoal and
        ashes were found.—<cite>Smithsonian Report</cite> for 1872, pp. 413 <i>et

      <a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> Since this is a contested point, both as to the presence
        of the works of the Mound-builders in the North-west and as to their
        great antiquity, I subjoin a portion of a report on these mounds
        made by Gen. H. W. Thomas, U. S. A., to Dr. Thomas of the Surveying
        Expedition, in the <cite>Sixth Annual Report of the U. S. Geological
        Survey</cite> under Dr. Hayden in 1872, pp. 656–7:

      <blockquote>
        <p>“‘Lewis and Clarke reported seeing Indian mounds 1000 miles above
          the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri, but this report
          is not verified.’ So says Mr. John D. Baldwin, A. M., in his work
          entitled ‘Ancient America.’</p>

        <p>“I now and here propose to contribute my mite toward the
          verification of the statement of Lewis and Clarke.</p>

        <p>“The few men whom duty or wild inclination have from time to
          time brought into this, for the most part, uninhabited region of
          treeless prairie, have all known of the existence of thousands of
          artificial mounds. What was in them they knew not, and but two or
          three, to my knowledge, have ever been opened. On August 16, 1872,
          I opened one on the high table-lands that spread out on both sides
          of a little stream called the James. The point is about 47° north
          latitude, and 98° 38´ longitude west from Greenwich. It is within
          three miles of the line of the North Pacific Railroad. The mound is
          circular in form, 30⁸⁄₁₀ feet in its shorter, and 35³⁄₁₀ feet in
          its longer diameter, and five feet high. I opened four trenches,
          three feet wide, from the outer edge, meeting in the centre,
          forming a cross when finished. I then excavated the entire mound
          from the centre outward, until there was nothing more to find.
          For results I had several two-bushel bags full of bones, eight
          skulls, many pieces of skulls too small to be of value (there must
          have been at least twenty-five bodies buried there), a rough-hewn
          stone ten inches high and five and a half inches in diameter, in
          shape resembling closely a conical shell, a cutting half an inch
          deep around the centre. (This was evidently tied with thongs to a
          stout handle, and used in pulverizing their maize.) A portion of a
          shell necklace, two flints, two heads of beaver, and some bones of
          animals unknown, and a large quantity of bivalves, much like the
          clam (<i>Mya oblongata</i>) of our Atlantic coast, but thicker, and
          the interior surface much more pearly.</p>

        <p>“The mounds and their contents are apparently of great antiquity.
          They are, in every case, on the very highest point in their
          immediate neighborhood, and perfectly drained. The climate is
          excessively dry; so dry that the James River is entirely dry at
          a point about 500 feet above the contemplated railroad-bridge
          across the river. Notwithstanding this, many of the bones crumbled
          into white dust on being brought to the air, like those found in
          Herculaneum and Pompeii, and it was absolutely impossible to get
          out a single one in anything like perfection. Around and over
          these bodies stones and sticks were placed, doubtless to preserve
          the remains from the coyote and the fox. The wood could be rubbed
          into fine yellow-brown dust between the thumb and forefinger. Any
          trace of excavation around the mound for dirt to heap it with had
          been entirely obliterated. The upright position of the skulls also
          indicated that the bodies were buried in a sitting posture. The
          leg-bones, however, lay lower and horizontal.</p>

        <p>“The number of mounds indicates a denser population than ever has
          been known here, or than the natural resources of this region can
          now support by the chase. At the same time the number of dry lakes
          scattered all over would indicate that at some remote period the
          country may have been a better one than now, and supported a larger
          population.”</p>

        Recent and possibly more exact surveys of the Alligator give the
        figures as somewhat less than the above. Isaac Smucker, a very
        reliable antiquarian of Licking Co., Ohio, in an address before the
        Ohio State Archæological Convention, held at Mansfield in September,
        1875, corrects the figures in the following statement: “The Alligator
        mound is upon the summit of a hill or spur, which is nearly 200 feet
        high, six miles west of Newark, and near the village of Granville.
        The outlines of the Alligator (or Crocodile) are clearly defined. His
        entire length is 205 feet. The breadth of the body at the widest part,
        twenty feet, and the length of the body between the fore-legs and
        hind-legs is fifty feet. The legs are each about twenty feet long. The
        head, fore-shoulders and rump have an elevation varying from three to
        six feet, while the remainder of the body averages a foot or two less.”

        features of these remains is the enclosure or ridge of <em>earth</em>
        (not brick, as has been erroneously stated), extending around three
        sides of an irregular parallelogram; the west branch of Rock River
        forming the fourth side on the east. The space thus enclosed is
        seventeen acres and two-thirds. The corners are not rectangular, and
        the embankment or ridge is not straight. The earth of which the ridge
        is made was evidently taken from the nearest ground, where there are
        numerous excavations of very irregular form and depth; precisely such
        as may be seen along our modern railroad and canal embankments. These
        excavations are not to be confounded with the hiding-places (caches) of
        the Indians, being larger and more irregular in outline. Much of the
        material of the embankment was doubtless taken from the surface without
        penetrating a sufficient depth to leave a trace at the present time. If
        we allow for difference of exposure of earth thrown up into a ridge and
        that lying on the original flat surface, we can perceive no difference
        between the soil composing the ridge and that found along its sides.
        Both consist of a light yellowish sandy loam. The ridge forming the
        enclosure is 631 feet long at the north end, 1419 feet long on the west
        side, and 700 feet on the south side; making a total length of wall
        2750 feet. The ridge or wall is about twenty-two feet wide, and from
        one foot to five in height.” * * * After describing one of the mounds
        of this enclosure, he remarks: “The analogy between these elevations
        and the ‘temple mounds’ of Ohio and the Southern States, will at once
        strike the reader who has seen the plans and descriptions. They have
        the same square or regular form, sloping or graded ascent, the terraced
        or step-like structure, and the same position in the interior of the
        enclosure. This kind of formation is known to increase in numbers and
        importance as we proceed to the south and south-west, until they are
        represented by the great structures of the same general character on
        the plains of Mexico.”

      <a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> Through the courtesy of Dr. R. J. Farquharson I am
        enabled to append the original report made by Mr. Gass to the Davenport
        Academy, Jan. 26, 1877. It is as follows:

      <blockquote>
        <p>“We broke the surface on the north-east slope of the mound about
          ten or twelve feet from the opening on the west side made in
          1874. The earth was frozen to a depth of about three and a half
          feet. Five or six inches below the surface we came upon a layer
          of shells one or two inches in thickness, which sloped downward
          toward the south-east, reaching a depth of two feet or rather more
          below the surface, and extending for a distance of ten or twelve
          feet. Between the surface and this first layer of shells a number
          of small fragments of human bones were found scattered through
          the soil. Under this shell layer was a stratum of earth of from
          twelve to fifteen inches in thickness, resting on a second layer of
          shells, from three to four inches in thickness. Both shell layers
          sloped downward nearly parallel with each other.</p>

        <p>“Below the second shell layer the earth was of the nature of a
          light mould, darker in color than the earth above and thickly
          interspersed with fragments of human bones. These circumstances
          arrested my attention and caused me to proceed from this time on
          with the greatest caution. At a depth of about fifteen inches under
          the lowest part of the shell layer exposed in this excavation—the
          shell stratum at this point being five or six inches thick—the
          inscribed slates were found. The slate is the same as that usually
          found overlying coal beds in this vicinity, and is such as is
          frequently seen cropping out from the hill-sides or in isolated
          slabs in the beds of streams. Both plates lay close together on the
          hard undisturbed clay bottom of the mound.</p>

        <p>“The engraved side of the smaller tablet was upward, and also
          that side of the larger one presenting the heavenly bodies,
          hieroglyphics, etc. The larger plate being partially divided by
          natural cleavage, its upper layer was unfortunately broken in
          two by a slight stroke of the spade. The two plates were closely
          encircled by a single row of weathered limestones. These stones are
          irregular in shape, but almost of the same size, their dimensions
          being about three by three by seven or eight inches, and the
          diameter of the circle about two feet.</p>

        <p>“In the immediate vicinity were found a number of fragments
          of human bones, one being a portion of a skull saturated with
          carbonate of copper. A small piece of copper was found; also many
          fragments of slate and a piece of bone artificially wrought.”</p>

        our knowledge of the mounds. The first mound examined yielded eight
        skulls, two of which were preserved. The third mound opened yielded
        the skeletons of four adults and several articles of interest, such
        as pieces of mica, a lump of galena and a dove-colored arrow-head.
        From the fifth mound opened, a remarkably well-preserved skeleton was
        recovered. Dr. Farquharson, of the Davenport Academy of Sciences,
        has contributed one of the most valuable tables of mound-cranial
        measurements ever published.

        1876, vol. i, pp. 274–5. The following description is given in
        <cite>Squier and Davis’s Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley</cite>:
        “The material is fine-grained, compact sandstone of a light-brown
        color. It measures five inches in length, three in breadth at the
        ends, and two and six-tenths at the middle, and is about half an inch
        in thickness. The sculptured face varies very slightly from a perfect
        plane. The figures are cut in low relief (the lines being not more than
        one-twentieth of an inch in depth), and occupy a rectangular space
        four inches and two-tenths long by two and one-tenth wide. The sides
        of the stone, it will be observed, are slightly concave. Right lines
        are drawn across the face near the ends, at right angles, and exterior
        to these are notches, twenty-five at one end and twenty-four at the
        other. The back of the stone has three deep longitudinal grooves, and
        several depressions, evidently caused by rubbing—probably produced by
        sharpening the instrument used in the sculpture.” [Mr. Gest, however,
        does not regard these as tool marks, but thinks they are of peculiar
        significance.] “Without discussing the singular resemblance which the
        relic bears to the Egyptian <em>Cartouch</em>, it will be sufficient
        to direct attention to the reduplication of the figures, those upon
        one side corresponding with those upon the other, and the two central
        ones being also alike. It will be observed that there are but three
        scrolls or figures—four of one and two of each of the others. Probably
        no serious discussion of the question whether or not these figures are
        hieroglyphical is needed. They more resemble the stalk and flowers of
        a plant than anything else in nature. What significance, if any, may
        attach to the peculiar markings or graduations at the end, it is not
        undertaken to say. The sum of the products of the longer and shorter
        lines (24 × 7 + 25 × 8) is 368, three more than the number of days in
        the year; from which circumstance the suggestion has been advanced
        that the tablet had an astronomical origin, and constituted some sort
        of a calendar.” We may here add that Col. Chas. Whittlesey published
        at Cleveland, Ohio, in <cite>Historical and Archæological Tract No. 9</cite>
        (Feb. 1872) of the Western Reserve Historical Society, a statement that
        the “Cincinnati Tablet” was a fraud. But we are informed that he is
        since convinced of its genuineness.

        Anthropological Conventions to Fort Ancient in September, 1877, and
        states that during the visit the significance of the walls of the lower
        enclosure was discovered. “They bear a resemblance,” he remarks, “to
        the form of two massive serpents, which are apparently contending with
        one another. Their heads are the mounds, which are separated from the
        bodies by the opening which resembles a ring around the neck. They
        bend in and out and rise and fall, and appear like two massive green
        serpents rolling along the summit of this high hill. Their appearance
        under the overhanging forest trees is very impressive”—p. 50. See also

        Lancaster is an earth wall, evidently for defence. The ditch is on the
        outside of the wall, where it should be according to modern ideas of
        defence. In this particular the earthwork differs from all the circles
        and so-called ‘forts,’ either circular or square, which I have seen,
        these having the ditch on the inside.”

      <a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">[40]</a> Dr. Patton has described some interesting mounds near
        Vincennes, Indiana. A giant mound, which towers above many others of
        considerable proportions, is called the Sugar-loaf Mound, and stands on
        a promontory which overlooks the rich valley of the Wabash. The height
        of the Sugar-loaf is seventy feet, with a circumference at the base
        of one thousand feet. Dr. Patton in June, 1873, sank a shaft in this
        mound to the depth of forty-six feet. The composition of the mound was
        of siliceous sand, nowhere found in the region except in other mounds.
        At ten feet below the summit bones were found, but much decayed.
        Immediately below them was a layer of charcoal and ashes. Thirty feet
        deeper the same conditions were repeated, and the bones again were so
        brittle as to render it impossible to save them. A bed of calcined clay
        was next entered which could not be penetrated with the instruments
        at command. One mile south of the Sugar-loaf is a pyramidal mound
        forty-three feet high, with a circumference of 714 feet at the base and
        a platform on top fifteen feet wide and fifty feet in length. Others of
        as great proportions are described. <cite>Smithsonian Report</cite>, 1873,

      <a id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="label">[58]</a> A sensational description of this mound which appeared
        in the <cite>St. Louis Times</cite> is used by Mr. S. M. Hosea as the
        basis of an article on Sacrificial Mounds in the above number of the
        <cite>Cincinnati Quarterly Jour. of Science</cite>, p. 62. The account
        contains some wonderful statements, which are evidently made by some
        unscientific person, and hence are utterly worthless. Although, judging
        from internal evidence, we have little faith in the reliableness of the
        correspondent, we give a paragraph for what it is worth: “The approach
        or causeway which leads across the trench from the north is ten feet
        in width. Ascending from this causeway to the summit of the mound
        are the remains of a rude flight of stairs, constructed originally
        of roughly-hewn stones. Most of these steps are now displaced, and
        quite a number have rolled down into the trench below, but there is
        unmistakable evidence that they were at one time arranged in regular
        order of ascent, and could doubtless be again replaced in position by
        an intelligent architect.” “By a series of investigations, I found that
        about a foot beneath the surface there was a regular solid platform
        of stone covering the entire top of the mound. This platform, though
        constructed by rude and unmechanical hands, is placed in position
        with a precision and firmness that might well defy the ravages of the
        elements in all coming ages. About twelve feet from the northern edge
        of the mound, and directly on a line with the approach and stairway,
        I noticed a very perceptible elevation of the earth, covering an
        area of about twenty by fifteen feet; and driving a pick into the
        elevated ground, the point struck upon solid rock a few inches below
        the surface. * * * Pushing our work, we soon unearthed a piece of
        workmanship that an antiquarian would have worked a week to bring to
        light. The newly-discovered curiosity consisted of a flat rock twelve
        feet long, ten feet wide, and eleven inches thick. The centre of the
        stone was hollowed to a depth of six inches, with a margin of about one
        foot around the edge.” “At the south end of the stone, a round hole
        five inches deep and four in diameter was drilled. Amongst the dirt
        taken out of this place hewn in the stone, was a large fossil tooth
        and a piece of small broken stone column, and several bits of pottery
        ware.” This description is very suggestive of the Mexican Temple or
        Teocalli, but unfortunately for the facts, Dr. Headlee, who made the
        measurements given in the text a short time subsequently, failed to
        find any certain evidences that either a stairway or temple had existed
        on the mound.

        121, 122, remarks: “There is a class of mounds west of the Mississippi
        Delta and extending from the Gulf to the Arkansas and above, and
        westward to the Colorado in Texas, that are to me, after thirty
        years’ familiarity with them, entirely inexplicable. In my Geological
        Reconnoissance of Louisiana in 1841–2, I made a pretty thorough report
        upon them. I afterwards gave a verbal description of their extent
        and character before the <cite>New Orleans Academy of Sciences</cite>.
        These mounds lack every evidence of artificial construction based on
        implements or other human vestigia. They are nearly all round, none
        angular, and have an elevation hemispheroidal of one foot to five feet,
        and a diameter from thirty feet to one hundred and forty feet. They
        are numbered by millions. In many places, in pine forests and upon the
        prairies, they are to be seen nearly tangent to each other as far as
        the eye can reach, thousands being visible from an elevation of a few
        feet. On the gulf-marsh margin, from the Vermillion to the Colorado,
        they appear barely visible, often flowing into one another, and only
        elevated a few inches above the common land. A few miles interior they
        rise to two and even four feet in height. The largest I ever saw were
        perhaps one hundred and forty feet in diameter and five feet high.
        These were in Western Louisiana. Some of them had abrupt sides, though
        they are nearly all of gentle slopes. There is ample testimony that the
        pine trees of the present forests antedate these mounds. The material
        for their construction is like that of the vicinity everywhere, and
        often there is a depression in close proximity to the elevation.” We
        can make no conjecture concerning the use of those mounds described by
        Prof. Forshey, except to suggest that they in all probability served as
        foundations for dwellings in a low country, which at that time may have
        been moister and more marshy than at present. If such was the case,
        the whole region must have presented the appearance of a continuous
        community instead of the proper proportion of country and village. This
        crowded state of affairs could have been produced by the pressure from
        enemies in the north, and the lack of agricultural lands evidently was
        sufficient alone to cause a migration to the south.

        Charles Rau in his <cite>Catalogue of the Archæological Collection of
        the National Museum</cite>, Washington, Smithsonian Contribution No. 287
        (1876), granted me through the courtesy of Professor Henry. A few also
        are from the memoir by Prof. Jos. Jones on the <cite>Aboriginal Remains
        of Tennessee</cite>. Smithsonian Contribution No. 259 (1876). For an
        able classification of these Mound Relics (a work which I could not
        undertake in a volume not devoted exclusively to the Mound-builders),
        I refer the reader to Rau’s Memoir above cited, as being altogether
        the most satisfactory attempt of the kind of which I have any
        knowledge. For a classification of works in Ohio, see <cite>Antiquities of
        Ohio</cite>: Report of the Committee of the State Archæological Society
        to the Centennial Commission of Ohio (Columbus, Ohio, 1877, 8vo).
        The incompleteness of the work is to be regretted. Ohio, out of its
        vast fund of material, certainly ought to furnish a more satisfactory
        contribution to the subject of archæology. The work comprises seven
        chapters, of which the last is the least satisfactory of all, for
        while bearing the title “Location of Ancient Earthworks in Ohio,”
        it enumerates only one hundred and sixteen out of the ten thousand
        mound-works in the State. Still the memoir is not without value. Its
        chapters on Stone Relics, Copper Relics, and Insignia and Ornaments are
        comparatively thorough.

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="label">[67]</a> <cite>Ancient Monuments</cite>, p. 143, the following general
        description is given: “The altars or basins found in these mounds are
        almost invariably of burned clay, although a few of stone have been
        discovered. They are symmetrical, but not of uniform size or shape.
        Some are round, others elliptical, and others square or parallelograms.
        Some are small, measuring barely two feet across, while others are
        fifty feet long by twelve or fifteen feet wide. The usual dimensions
        are from five to eight feet. All appear to have been modelled of fine
        clay brought to the spot from a distance, and they rest on the original
        surface of the earth. In a few instances a layer or small elevation of
        sand had been laid down, upon which the altar was formed. The height of
        the altars, nevertheless, seldom exceeds a foot or twenty inches above
        the adjacent level. The clay of which they are composed is usually
        burned hard, sometimes to the depth of ten, fifteen, and even twenty
        inches. This is hardly to be explained by any degree or continuance of
        heat, though it is manifest that in some cases the heat was intense. On
        the other hand, a number of these altars have been noticed which are
        very slightly burned; and such, it is a remarkable fact, are destitute
        of remains.”

        Sault, le premier endroit que se présente où se retrouve du cuivre
        en abondance, est une Isle que est éloignée de quarante on cinquante
        lieuës, scituée vers le côté du Nord, vis a vis d’un endroit qu’on
        appelle Missipicoüatong. Les sauvages racontent que c’est une Isle
        flottante, que est quelquefois loing, quelquefois proche, selon les
        vents qui la poussent, et la promenent de côté et d’autre. Ils ajoûtent
        qu’il y a bien longtemps que quatre sauvages y furent par rencontre,
        s’etans égarez dans la brume, dont cette Isle est presque toujours
        environnée. C’étoit du temps qu’ils n’avoient point encore eu de
        commerce avec les François, et n’avoient aucun usage ny des chaudieres
        ny des haches. Ceux-cy donc voulans se preparer à manger, firent à leur
        ordinaire: prenant des pierres qu’ils trouvoient au bord de l’eau, les
        faisaient rougir dans le feu et les jettaient dans un plat d’ecorce
        plein d’eau pour la faire boüillir et faire cuire par cette industrie
        leur viande. Comme ils choisissoient ces pierres, ils trouvoient, que
        c’étoient presque tous morceaux de cuivre; ils se servirent donc des
        unes et des autres, et aprés avoir pris leur repas, ils songerent à
        s’embarquer au plustost, craignant les Loups Cerviers et les Lievres,
        qui sont en cét endroit grands comme des Chiens, et qui venoient
        manger leurs provisions et même leur Canot. Avant que de partir, ils
        se chargerent de quantité de ces pierres grosses et menuës, et même de
        quelques plaques de cuivre; mais ils ne furent pas bien éloignez du
        rivage, qu’une puissante voix se fit entendre à leurs oreilles, disant
        tout en colere: Qui sont ces voleurs qui m’emportent les berceaux
        et les divertissemens de mes enfans? Les plaques de cuivre sont les
        berceaux, parce que parmy les sauvages ils ne sont faits que d’un ou
        deux aix joints ensemble, sur lesquels ils couchent leurs enfans; et
        ces petits morçeaux de cuivre qu’ils enlevoient, sont les jouets et
        les divertissemens des enfans sauvages, qui joüent ensemble avec des
        petites pierres.” The voice which the savages heard was believed to be
        that of a spirit called Missibizi, a certain water-god. “Quoy qu’il en
        soit, cette voix étonnante jetta tellement la frayeur dans l’esprit de
        nos Voyageurs, qu’un des quatre mourut avant que d’arriver à terre;
        peu de temps aprés un second fut enlevé, puis le troisièma; de sorte
        qu’il n’en resta qu’un, lequel s’étant rendu en son Pays, raconta
        tout ce qui s’étoit passé, pues mourut fort peu apriés.” The Father
        adds that the savages never afterward could be induced to approach
        the island for fear of being seized by the Genii presiding over its
        treasures.—<cite>Relations des Jesuités l’année 1670</cite>, p. 84, tome iii.

        of them were applied, it is believed, was the making of signals, or
        possibly rude music. One of the tubes taken from the Tippet Mound near
        Newark, Ohio, and figured in the report, has its upper end flattened
        like a whistle or flute, and has a hole penetrating it just below the

        The Huron slates were most frequently employed in the manufacture of

        in mounds or in deposits below the surface of the soil. There is little
        doubt, for instance, that there were persons who devoted their time

        numerous mica plates in a mound on the east bank of the Little Miami
        River, about twenty-five miles east of Cincinnati. He states, that
        at the base of the mound, on a level with the surrounding country,
        the remains of several skeletons were found, placed with their heads
        together and lying in a horizontal position. “Lying upon or immediately

        diameter. These plates were disposed in such a way as to cover an area
        somewhat larger than that occupied by the crania beneath. However,
        it could not definitely be determined whether the design had been to
        make a continuous or common roof over the faces as a group, or whether
        each face had a covering of its own.” The writer ventures the rather
        fanciful conjecture that the mica in this and many other cases served

        Mound-works by Rev. Stephen D. Peet in the same document, p. 103, is
        very satisfactory, and corresponds to that adopted in this chapter. The
        learned article by Judge Force of Cincinnati in the same document, vol.

        Foster. In this connection I refer the reader to the argument of
        Mr. John H. Becker of Berlin, in the <cite>Congrès International des
        Américanistes</cite>, Luxembourg, 1877, tom. i, pp. 345–6: “These northern
        nations * * * have not quite forgotten the former existence and the
        exodus of these Nahua Mound-builders in and from the western prairie
        country. Cusick’s remarkable history of the Iroquois (Schoolcraft,
        vol. v) states again and again that ‘their hunters were opposed by big
        snakes,’ that the ‘great horned snake appeared on Lake Ontario,’ that
        the ‘lake serpent traversed the country, and they were compelled to
        build fortifications in order to save themselves from the devouring
        monsters,’ that ‘a snake with a human head prevented the intercourse
        of their several villages, as it had settled near the principal path
        of communication,’ also ‘that it retreats,’ etc., etc. Now, in order
        to understand the force of these passages, it is necessary to remind
        the reader that the Nahua race were perhaps even more properly and
        generally designated as the ‘Culhua’ the ‘Snake’ race, and one branch,
        remotely connected with them in blood and language, though wofully
        degenerated, the Snakes or Shoshones of Oregon, etc., carry the name to
        this very day. * * * ‘An expedition was sent towards the Mississippi
        River; they crossed it, reached an extensive meadow; they discovered a
        <em>curious animal</em>, a <em>winged fish</em>; it flew about the tree,
        it moved like a <em>humming bird</em>’ * * * the <em>humming bird</em> was
        the totem of the last tribe of Nahuas, arriving in Anahuac from Aztlan.
        The Cherokee tradition, told by Timberlake, is equally significant:
        ‘The prince of rattlesnakes lives in the glens of the mountains. His
        palace is guarded by obedient subjects. * * * And in the myth of the
        Algonquins, the god-hero Michabo is in conflict with the shining prince
        of serpents who lives in the lake; he destroys the reptile with a dart;
        clothes himself with the skin of his foe, and <em>drives the rest of the
        serpents to the south</em>.’”

      <a id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88" class="label">[88]</a> Foster, pp. 172–3, remarks: “Squier and Davis hastily
        stated that none of these works occupied the alluvial bottoms (an error
        which Mr. Squier subsequently corrected), and from this statement the
        most erroneous conclusions as to their antiquity have been drawn.
        There is nothing to indicate but that those works were constructed
        after the surface had assumed its present configuration, and that the
        climate had become essentially as it is now. That they should not
        occur as abundantly on the bottoms as on the river terraces is not
        to be wondered at, when we consider the great fluctuations of the
        Mississippi and its tributaries. The extreme range between low and
        high water of the Upper Mississippi at its mouth is thirty-five feet;
        that of the Missouri at its mouth about the same; and that of the Ohio
        at Louisville, forty-two feet. Hence, during the flood time a greater
        portion of the bottom lands are subject to overflow, and it would be
        natural for the Mound-builders to shun such situations. Where the
        immediate valleys lie above high water, we find their works. Of this
        the ‘American Bottom’ is a notable instance.”

        when they were forsaken, the ground, like all newly-cleared land in
        Ohio, would for a time be monopolized by one or two species of tree,
        such as the yellow locust and the black or white walnut. When the
        individuals which were the first to get possession of the ground had
        died out one after the other, they would, in many cases, instead of
        being replaced by other species, be succeeded, by virtue of the law
        which makes a rotation of crops profitable in agriculture, by other
        kinds, till at last, after a great number of centuries (several hundred
        years perhaps), that remarkable diversity of species characteristic
        of North America, and far exceeding what is seen in European forests,
        would be established.”

        miles between Pilatka and Salt Creek Dr. Wyman made some collections
        of interest. The banks were composed mostly of the <i>Ampullaria
        Depressa</i>, the <i>Paludina Multilineata</i> and <i>Unio
        Buckleyi</i>. The bank at King Phillip’s Town, 450 feet long by 120
        feet wide, and in some places eight feet thick, yielded fragments
        of pottery and decayed animal bones. At Black Hammock, on the St.
        Johns, a mound 900 feet long and from 100 to 150 in width, yielded
        the following: such marine shells as the strombus-gigos, pyrula
        carica and P. perversa. These had been shaped into hatchets, gouges
        and chisels. Scarcely any stone implements were found in any of the
        mounds examined. A chisel and twenty-five arrow-heads were collected
        in the vicinity of the above shell-bank. The following animal remains
        were found: bear, deer, raccoon, opossum, terrapin, turtle, alligator,
        cat-fish and garpike. But few bones of birds were found. Prof. Wyman
        can only explain the presence of so many of the now scarce species,
        the Ampullarius and Paludinas, on the supposition that they were much
        more plentiful and are now becoming extinct, or that the heaps where so

        Zustand dieser Naturwesen beurkundet, dass die amerikanische Natur
        schon seit Jahrtausenden den Einfluss einer verändernden und
        umgestaltenden Menschenhand erfahren hat. Auf den Antillen und dem
        Festlande fanden die ersten Conquistadores den stummen Hund als
        Hausthier und auf der Jagd dienend, ebenso das Meerschweinchen in
        St. Domingo in einem heimischen Zustande.... Das Llama war in Peru
        schon seit undenklicher Zeit als Lastthier benützt worden, und kam
        nicht mehr im Zustand der Freiheit vor; ja sogar das Guanaco und die
        Vicunna scheinen damals nicht ganz wild, sondern in einer beschränkten
        Freiheit den Urbewohnern befreundet, gelebt zu haben, da sie, um
        geschoren zu werden, eingefangen, so dann aber wieder freigelassen
        würden.... Die Cultur dieser Pflanze (Maize) aus welcher die Peruaner
        auch Zucker bereiteten, ist uralt; man findet sie, und die Banane, den
        Baumwollenstrauch, die Quinoa- und die Mandioca-Pflanze ebenso wenig
        wild in America als unsere Getreidearten in Asien, Europa und Africa.
        Die einzige Palme, welche von den Indianern angebaut wird, hat durch
        diese Cultur den grossen, steinharten Saamenkern verloren, der oft in
        Fasern zerschmolzen, oft gänzlich aufgelöst ist. Ebenso findet man die
        Banane, deren Einfuhr nach America geschichtlich nicht nachgewiesen
        werden kann, immer ohne Saamen. Man weiss aber aus anderen Erfahrungen,
        welch’ lange Zeit nothwendig ist, um den Pflanzen einen solchen Stempel
        von der umbildenden Macht menschlichen Einflusses aufzudrücken. Gewiss,
        auch in America sind die dort heimischen Nutz-Pflanzen der Menschheit
        seit undenklichen Zeiten zinsbar unterworfen.”

        valueless to science; still, it is due to the memory of the latter,
        to admit that he was the most indefatigable and successful collector
        in his department in this country. Though unscientific himself, his
        service to science must ever be recognized. The great Mastodon in the
        British Museum is a monument to his persevering research. Perhaps the
        disposition to acknowledge his services, has unduly biased the judgment
        of many in favor of his groundless claim.

      <a id="Footnote_153" href="#FNanchor_153" class="label">[153]</a> General Thomas gives the following account of this
        form of skull discovered by him, p. 657: “It is unlike that of any
        human being to-day alive on this continent; the frontal bone being
        low, receding, growing narrow and pinched from the brows up; the top
        of the head depressed in the centre. The cavity of the cranium is
        full seven inches long, and a scant four and a half inches wide. The
        orbital ridges or eyebrows are excessively developed, like those of
        the great Gibbon monkey. In fact the whole skull resembles that of the
        great Gibbon monkey. The malar or cheek bones run down very low and
        deep toward the lower jaw, are set very far to the front, and are not
        wide at top, but widen very much toward the bottom. The nose, and here
        is the anomaly, is much more aquiline than that of the Indian. The
        superior maxillary is one-third deeper and much more prominent than
        the Indian’s. The inferior maxillary is of uncommon prominence, depth,
        and power, far exceeding that of the Indian. The mouth is narrow and
        long, more dog-shaped than the Indian’s. The <i>foramen magnum</i> or
        aperture at base of skull, where the spinal cord enters the head, is
        peculiarly small. The <i>condyloid processes</i> are full, oblong, flat
        on the working surfaces, and at such an angle as to set the head upward
        and back more than any race we know to-day on this continent. Set one
        of these skulls, without the lower jaw, on the table, and a line drawn
        from the upper jaw perpendicularly upward would be a good inch and a
        half in front of the forehead. Set on the lower jaw and it would be
        two inches.” Mr. R. D. Guttgisal, formerly an engineer on the Mexican
        Central Railroad, in connection with some friends, opened a mound at
        Chihuahua, on the line of that railroad. The skulls resembled those I
        have described (so he informs me) in every particular. He especially
        remembers the somewhat bird-shaped head, and the excessively small
        <i>foramen magnum</i>. The bodies were not interred horizontally there,
        but leaning backward as if in a rocking-chair. Professor H. H. Smith,
        University of Pennsylvania, has one of the skulls.

        transpired in the condition of man from his first appearance in
        America, says: “But even if we attribute to these changes all the
        importance which ever has been claimed for them, they will not require
        an antiquity of more than three thousand years. I do not, of course,
        deny that the period may have been very much greater, but in my
        opinion, at least, it <em>need</em> not be greater.”—<cite>Pre-Historic
        Times</cite>, p. 234, London, 1865.

      <p>Dr. Foster, after giving many of the reputed proofs of man’s antiquity
        here, sums up the argument in the following language: “The evidence, it
        must be confessed, rests, in most cases, upon the testimony of a single
        observer, and besides, there has not been a recurrence of ‘finds’ in
        the same deposit (except in the gravel beds of Colorado and Wyoming,
        which require further investigation to command an unqualified belief),
        as in the valley of the Somme and in the European caves, which is so
        conclusive as to the existence of man as contemporary with the great
        Pachyderms.”—<cite>Foster’s Pre-Historic Races</cite>, p. 71.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_158" href="#FNanchor_158" class="label">[158]</a> The narrowness of the attainments of the “educated” in
        Spain in the 17th century is portrayed by Buckle: “Books, unless they
        were books of devotion, were deemed utterly useless; no one consulted
        them, no one collected them; and until the 18th century, Madrid did
        not possess a single public library. * * * De Torres, who was himself
        a Spaniard, and was educated at Salamanca early in the 18th century,
        declares that he had studied in the university for five years before
        he had heard that such things as the mathematical sciences existed. So
        late as the year 1771, the same university publicly refused to allow
        the discoveries of Newton to be taught; and assigned as a reason, that
        the system of Newton was not so consonant with revealed religion as the
        system of Aristotle.”—<cite>History of Civilization in England</cite>, vol.
        ii, pp. 72–3. New York, 1861. Of course these remarks apply to Spain’s
        period of misfortune and decline, but it must also be remembered that
        the spirit of intolerance which alone brought about that condition was
        at its height about the time of the discovery of America.

        How the Abbé and the Emperor could have been so blinded to its real

        following passage occurs on p. 66 of the above work: “The most careful
        study concerning the origin of the red-skins, made on the spot,
        has confirmed us in the belief that there is nothing in science to

        the following from the translation by Cullan, London, 1807: “We do
        not doubt that the population of America has been very ancient, and
        more so than it may seem to have been to European authors: 1. Because
        the Americans wanted those arts and inventions, such, for example,
        as those of wax and oil for light, which on the one hand being very
        ancient in Europe and Asia, are on the other most useful, not to say
        necessary, and when once discovered are never forgotten. 2. Because the
        polished nations of the new world, and particularly those of Mexico,
        preserve in their traditions and in their paintings the memory of the
        creation of the world and of the building of the Tower of Babel, the
        confusion of languages and the dispersion of the people, though blended
        with some fables, and had no knowledge of the events which happened
        afterwards in Asia, in Africa, or in Europe, although many of them
        were so great and remarkable that they could not easily have gone from
        their memories. 3. Because neither was there among the Americans any
        knowledge of the people of the old continent, nor among the latter any
        account of the passage of the former to the new world.” He then cites
        Votan. See further on early views, Gottfried Wagner’s <cite>De Originibus

        are already before that public—to whose final judgment (upon its
        merits or demerits) the present author submits the first history of
        ancient America with all humility; but he will yield to none in the
        conscientious belief in the truth of the startling propositions and the
        consequent conclusions.” With such convictions there is no opportunity

        are native and indigenous to the soil. There is no proof that they

        the old world. They are a separate and as distinct a race as either
        the Ethiopian, Caucasian, or Mongolian. In the absence of all proof
        to the contrary, it seems to me to be both rational and consistent

      <a id="Footnote_223" href="#FNanchor_223" class="label">[223]</a> After presenting several arguments together with
        accompanying proofs, Agassiz says: “This coincidence between the
        circumscription of the races of man and the natural limits of different
        zoological provinces characterized by peculiar distinct species of
        animals, is one of the most important and unexpected features in
        the Natural History of Mankind, which the study of the geographical
        distribution of all the organized beings now existing upon earth has
        disclosed to us. It is a fact which cannot fail to throw light at some
        future time upon the very origin of the differences existing among
        men, since it shows that man’s physical nature is modified by the same
        laws as that of animals, and that any general results obtained from
        the animal kingdom regarding the organic differences of its various
        types must also apply to man. Now there are only two alternatives
        before us at present: 1st. Either mankind originated from a common
        stock, and all the different races with their peculiarities, in their
        present distribution, are to be ascribed to subsequent changes—an
        assumption for which there is no evidence whatever, and leads at once
        to the admission that the diversity among animals is not an original
        one, nor their distribution determined by a general plan established
        in the beginning of the creation; or 2d, we must acknowledge that
        the diversity among animals is a fact determined by the will of the
        Creator, and their geographical distribution part of the general plan
        which unites all organized beings into one great organic conception;
        whence it follows that what are called human races down to their
        specializations as nations are distinct primordial forms of the type of
        man.” * * * He concludes in these words: “The laws which regulate the
        diversity of animals and their distribution upon earth apply equally
        to man <em>within the same limits and in the same degree</em>; and all
        our liberty and moral responsibility, however spontaneous, are yet
        instinctively directed by the All-wise and Omnipotent to fulfill the
        great harmonies established in Nature.”—<cite>Types of Mankind</cite>, pp.

      <a id="Footnote_228" href="#FNanchor_228" class="label">[228]</a> As an illustration of complex classification, we have
        the following: “From an old and well-filled European graveyard may be
        selected specimens of <i>klimocephalic</i> (slope or saddle skull),
        <i>conocephalic</i> (cone-skull), <i>brachycephalic</i> (short-skull),
        <i>dolichocephalic</i> (long-skull), <i>platycephalic</i> (flat-skull),
        <i>leptocephalic</i> (slim-skull), and other forms of crania equally
        worthy of penta or hexa-syllabic Greek epithets.”—<i>Owen (R.)</i>,
        <i>Anatomy of Vertebrates</i>, vol. ii, p. 570. London, 1866, 8vo.
        Foster, in <i>Pre-Historic Rates of the United States</i>, in addition
        to the long and short skulls, adopts also the <i>orthocephalic</i>
        (erect-head), with the longitudinal diameter 100; he assumes the
        transverse diameter for dolichocephalæ to be less than 73; for
        orthocephalæ, to range between 74 and 79, and for brachycephalæ, 80 and upwards.

        <cite>Smithsonian Report</cite>, 1862, pp. 250 <i>et seq.</i> Dr. Wilson
        clearly shows that in one set there is the characteristic Mongol
        auxiliary of prominent cheek bones, while in the other the bones of
        the face are small and delicate. In twenty-six measurements he finds
        proof that the Peruvians were distinct from the Mexicans. Thirty-one
        dolichocephalic crania as compared with twenty-two brachycephalic
        crania convince him of the error of Morton and establish a diversity
        among the tribes of the North-east. He thinks analogies are traceable
        between the Esquimaux and the type of elongated skull; at all events he
        is satisfied that the form of the skull is as little constant among the
        tribes of the new world as among those of the old.

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_231" href="#FNanchor_231" class="label">[231]</a> This author (Dr. Morton), who has given us such numerous
        and valuable facts, as well as the linguists who have studied these
        American languages with indefatigable zeal, have arrived at the
        conclusion that both race and language in the new world are unique. I
        am obliged to avow that the facts advanced by Morton himself, and that
        the study of numerous skulls with which he has enriched the museum of
        Stockholm, have conducted me to a wholly different result. I can only
        explain the fact by surmising that this remarkable man has allowed the
        views of the naturalist to be warped by his linguistic researches. For,
        if the form of the skull has anything to do with the question of races,
        we cannot fail to see that it is scarcely possible to find anywhere
        a more distinct distribution into dolichocephalæ and brachycephalæ
        than in America. It would be only necessary, in order to show this, to
        direct attention to certain of the delineations in his own work, where
        the skull of the Peruvian infant (Pl. 2), the Lenni-Lenape (Pl. 32),
        the Pawnee (Pl. 38), the Blackfoot (Pl. 40), etc., as clearly present
        the dolichocephalic form as on the other hand his Natchez (Pl. 30 and
        31) and the greater part of his representations of the skulls of Chile,
        Peru, Mexico, Oregon, etc., are distinct types of the brachycephalic.
        Conclusive, however, as the plates are, I should scarcely have ventured
        to advance these remarks, if the rich series of our own collection, and
        the numerous and excellent figures of Blumenbach, Sandifort, Van der
        Hoeven, etc., did not declare in favor of my opinion. (<cite>Retzius</cite>
        in <cite>Smithsonian Report</cite>, 1859, p. 264.)

      <p>Latham, in <cite>Natural History of the Varieties of Man</cite>, p. 452,
        says: “As to the conformation of the skull, a point where (with
        great deference) I differ with the author of the excellent <cite>Crania
        Americana</cite>, the Americans are said to be <i>brakhy</i>-kephalic,
        the Eskimo <i>dolikho</i>-kephalic.” He quotes Morton’s tables to
        contradict his (Morton’s) conclusions.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_232" href="#FNanchor_232" class="label">[232]</a> “Tried by Dr. Morton’s own definitions and
        illustrations, the Scioto Mound skull differs from the typical
        cranium in some of its most characteristic features. Instead of the
        low, receding, unarched forehead, it has a finely-arched frontal
        bone with corresponding breadth of forehead. The wedge-shaped vertex
        is replaced by a well-rounded arch curving equally throughout; and
        with the exception of the flattened occiput, due to artificial
        though probably undesigned compression in infancy, the cranium
        is a uniformly proportioned example of an extreme brachycephalic
        skull.”—<cite>Pre-Historic Man</cite>, vol. ii, p. 127.

        skulls found in an ancient cemetery near Mexico, which was uncovered
        in digging intrenchments to protect the Mexican capital against the
        armies of the United States. They are remarkable for the shortness
        of their axis, large flattened occiput, obliquely truncated behind,
        the height of the semicircular line of the temples, the shortness and
        trapezoid form of the parietal plane. They present an elevation or
        ridge along the sagittal suture; the base of the skull is very short,
        the face slightly prognathic, as among the Mongol Kalmucs. (Retzius in

      <a id="Footnote_256" href="#FNanchor_256" class="label">[256]</a> We can no longer doubt, then, that this practice of
        giving an artificial form to the skull has subsisted from a remote
        epoch among the Oriental nations. As Thierry, moreover, pronounces
        it to be a Mongol usage, I have submitted the question in the memoir
        before spoken of, whether this fact does not speak in favor of an
        ancient communication between the old and the new world? Such a
        communication seems, indeed, to be now placed beyond doubt by the
        proofs which have been accumulated from time to time, through the
        efforts of numerous and zealous inquirers. It would seem likely that
        the usage in question has been introduced by the Mongols into America,
        where it has become diffused even among tribes not of the Mongol
        stock. (Retzius in <cite>Smithsonian Report</cite>, 1859, p. 270; also the

        twenty-five recorded cases of such an event. Now, as the space of one
        year is the shortest possible time allowed by authorities for such
        a cure to take place, and as during all this time the parts must be
        kept absolutely at rest, and the person so afflicted being entirely
        helpless, the inference is a strong one that these people were not in
        a savage state. They must necessarily have been in such a state, in
        the progress of advancement in civilization, as to be possessed of an
        accumulation of food, the requisite leisure of persons nursing the

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_320" href="#FNanchor_320" class="label">[320]</a> The explanation given by Cabrera is as follows: “Let
        us suppose then, with Calmet and other authors whom he quotes, that
        some of the Hivites who were descendants from Heth, son of Canaan,
        were settled on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and known from the
        most remote parts under the name of Hivim or Givim, from which region
        they were expelled, some years before the departure of the Hebrews
        from Egypt, by the Caphtorims or Philistines, who, according to some
        writers, were colonists from Cappadocia, others considering them to
        be from Cyprus, and more probably, according to a third opinion, from
        Crete, now Candia; that to strengthen their native country Egypt, and
        to protect themselves from all assault, they built five large cities,
        viz.: Accaron, Azotus, Ascalon, and Gaza [fifth wanting in account],
        from whence they made frequent sallies upon the Canaanite towns and all
        their surrounding neighbors (except the Egyptians, whom they always
        respected), and carried on many wars in the posterior ages against
        the Hebrews. The Scriptures (Deuteronomy, chap. ii, verse 23, and
        Joshua, chap. xiii, verse 4) inform us of the expulsion of the Hivites
        (Givim) by the Caphtorims, from which it appears that the latter
        drove out the former, who inhabited the countries from Azzah to Gaza.
        Many others were settled in the vicinity of the mountains of Eval and
        Azzah, among whom were reckoned the Sichemites and the Gabaonites; the
        latter by stratagem made alliance with Joshua, or submitted to him.
        Lastly, others had their dwellings about the skirts of Mount Hermon,
        beyond Jordan to the eastward of Canaan (Joshua, chap. ii, verse 3).
        Of these last were Cadmus and his wife Hermione or Hermonia, both
        memorable in sacred as well as profane history, as their exploits
        occasioned their being exalted to the rank of deities, while in regard
        to their metamorphosis into snakes (Culebras) mentioned by Ovid,
        <cite>Metam.</cite>, lib. 3, their being Hivites may have given rise to this
        fabulous transmutation, the name in the Phœnician language implying
        a snake, which the ancient Hebrew writers suppose to have been given
        from this people being accustomed to live in caves under ground like
        snakes.”—<cite>Cabrera, Teatro Critico</cite>, pp. 47–8. On p. 95 he reaches
        the conclusion that the Votanites were Carthaginians.

      <a id="Footnote_323" href="#FNanchor_323" class="label">[323]</a> The description of its contents drawn by Brasseur de
        Bourbourg from the part in his possession is briefly as follows:
        The second volume of Ordoñez comprised the history of the ancestors
        of Votan, a descendant of Shem by the Hivo-Phœnician line; of their
        emigration from the Eastern Continent to the Occident; of their voyage
        with their first legislator by the Usumasinta River and its affluents
        to the Plain Palenque; the foundation of the great monarchy of the
        Quichés as well as that of Nachan, which was the capital; of the
        founding of the three royal cities of Mayapan, Tulha, and Chiquimula.
        The Abbé finds allusion to this work in Torquemada, Juarros, Cogolludo,
        Lizana, and particularly in Sahugun, book iii of his <cite>Hist. Gen.</cite>,
        where it is claimed to treat of the original inhabitants of Palenque.
        He then states that the work was written in Guatemala at the close of
        the eighteenth century, and was sent to Spain or taken thither by its
        author for publication. In 1803 it was found in the hands of Sr. Gil
        Lemos of Madrid, where it had been left for publication. Its contents
        becoming known to the Council of the Indias, it was suppressed like
        many others on the early history of America. Ordoñez, who for ten years
        afterwards was canon of the Cathedral at Ciudad Real, died without
        seeing his work published. See Brasseur de Bourbourg, <cite>Cartas</cite>, p.

        biblioteca de la Universidad de Guatemala, publicado por la primera
        vez, y aumentado con una introduccion y anotaciones por el Dr. C.
        Scherzer.</span> Father Ximenez, a Dominican and curate of Chichicastenango
        of Guatemala, wrote about 1720, and subsequently. His work, because of
        its condemnation of the oppression of the Indians, was suppressed, but
        was finally discovered in June, 1854, in the library of the University
        of San Carlos, in Guatemala, by Dr. Scherzer. Father Ximinez describes
        the work as a literal copy of an original Quiché book, made in Roman
        letters by Quiché copyists, after the introduction of Christianity into
        Guatemala. The copy is stated ambiguously to have been made to replace
        the original <cite>Popol Vuh</cite>—national book—which was lost. How a book
        which had been lost could be copied literally, the Father fails to
        tell us. Internal evidence, however, sustains the claim that it was
        written by native Quichés. In 1860, Brasseur de Bourbourg undertook
        a new translation of the <cite>Popol Vuh</cite>, from the Ximinez document
        (containing the Quiché and Spanish). This he did among the Quichés and
        with the aid of the natives, and as a result it is believed that a much
        more literal translation than that made by Ximenez was obtained. In our
        examination of Quiché history we have compared both translations and
        shall draw from them directly, but shall also take advantage of the
        excellent condensations and renderings which Mr. Hubert H. Bancroft has
        made. See <cite>Native Races</cite>, vol. iii, p. 42, note, for the leading
        facts as we have stated them.

        convinced that it is useless to attempt to arrive at the true date,
        just as it is impossible to determine any date with certainty in all
        the ancient American chronology. We will not go so far as Mr. Bancroft,
        who says that “the departure from Hue hue Tlapalan seems to have
        taken place in the fifth or sixth century.” The claims for the fourth
        century, we think, are just as good as for the others, if not better.

      <a id="Footnote_420" href="#FNanchor_420" class="label">[420]</a> The following account is from Franc. Gemelli Carreri’s
        <cite>Voyage Round the World</cite>, Churchill’s <cite>Voyages</cite>, London,
        1732, 6 vol. fol. (book iv, cap. iii), p. 485: “The ancient histories
        of Mexico make mention of a flood, in which all men and beasts
        perished, and only one man and woman were saved in a boat, which in
        their language they call <i>Acalle</i>. The man, according to the
        character by which his name is expressed, was called Cox-cox, and the
        woman Chichequetzal. This couple coming to the foot of the mountain,
        which, according to the picture, was named Culhuacan, went ashore, and
        there they had many children, all born dumb. When they multiplied to a
        great number, one day a pigeon came, and from the top of a tree gave
        them their speech, but not one of them understood the others’ language,
        and therefore they divided and dispersed, every one going to take
        possession of some country. Among these they reckoned fifteen heads
        of families who happened to speak the same language, joined together
        and went about to find some land to inhabit. When they had wandered
        one hundred and four years they came to the place they call Antlan,
        and continuing their journey thence, came first to the place called
        <i>Capultepec</i>, then to Culhuacan, and lastly to the place where
        Mexico now stands.”

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_422" href="#FNanchor_422" class="label">[422]</a> We should be guilty of a fault if we were to convey
        the idea that no deluge legend other than this was current among the
        Aztecs. The Codex Chimalpopoca records a flood in which mankind were
        drowned and turned into fishes. In Mr. Bancroft’s graceful rendering we
        learn that “the waters and sky drew near each other; in a single day
        all was lost, the day Four Flower consumed all that there was of our
        flesh. And this was the year Ce-Calli; on the first day, Nahui-Atl,
        all was lost. The very mountains were swallowed up in the flood, and
        the waters remained, lying tranquil during fifty and two spring-times.
        But before the flood began, Titlacahuan had warned the man Nata and
        his wife Nena, saying: Make now no more pulque, but hollow out to
        yourselves a great cypress, into which you shall enter when, in the
        month Tozoztli, the waters shall near the sky. Then they entered into
        it, and when Titlacahuan had shut them in, he said to the man: Thou
        shalt eat but a single ear of maize, and thy wife but one also. And
        when they had finished eating, each an ear of maize, they prepared to
        set forth, for the waters remained tranquil and their log moved no
        longer; and opening it they began to see the fishes. Then they lit a
        fire by rubbing pieces of wood together and they roasted fish.” The
        account states that the deities then descended and transformed the
        fishes into dogs. (Brasseur de Bourbourg, <cite>Hist. Nat. Civ.</cite>, tom.
        i, pp. 425–7. Bancroft, vol. iii, pp. 69, 70.) We cannot with gravity
        give the Tezpi legend preserved in Michoacan. If the reader will refer
        to the Mosaic account of the flood, he will only need to substitute the
        name of Tezpi for Noah, a vulture for the raven, and a humming-bird
        for the dove, and the Tezpi legend substantially will be before him.
        Of course the detail of the Mosaic account is wanting; nevertheless
        it is certain that the Tezpi legend is the product of the fancy of
        some over-zealous priest, who thought he could see a stricter analogy
        between the Nahua deluge tradition and the Scriptural account than
        really exists.

      <a id="Footnote_426" href="#FNanchor_426" class="label">[426]</a> E. G. Squier in <cite>Notes on Cent. Am.</cite>, p. 349, makes
        the following remark: “It is a significant fact, that in the map of
        their migrations, presented by Gemelli, the place of the origin of the
        Aztecs is designated by the sign of water (Atl standing for Atzlan), a
        pyramidal temple with grades, and near these a <em>palm-tree</em>. This
        circumstance did not escape the attention of the observant Humboldt,
        who says, ‘I am astonished at finding a palm-tree near this teocalli.
        This tree certainly does not indicate a northern origin.’” We might add
        that we are equally surprised that so generally able a writer as Mr.
        Squier should resort to so absolutely weak an argument. Sr. Ramirez
        has clearly explained that all the figures and their adjuncts are but
        hieroglyphic parts of proper names. The palm-tree no doubt plays its
        part. M. Waldeck (<cite>Voyage Pitt.</cite>, p. 45) makes the same remark
        as Mr. Squier—that it indicates a southern origin. Gondra (Prescott’s
        <cite>Historia Conq. Mex.</cite>, cited by Bancroft, vol. v, p. 306, note)
        replies that this may be a thoughtless insertion of the painter.
        The possibility that an unskillful artist should unintentionally
        represent a tree of which he had no knowledge is so great, that any
        argument dependent upon it hangs upon a slender thread. Over against
        Mr. Squier’s claim we desire to place the simple inquiry, Does the
        Elephant Mound of Wisconsin indicate that its constructors were natives
        of Asia, where the elephant is common, or that they lived in the epoch
        of the American Mastodon? It is well-known that the latter phase of
        the question could not be true, since the condition of the mound
        contradicts such great antiquity.

        of Cibola” in 1540, saw a roofless building called Chichilticale, or
        “red house.” Castañeda says it was built of red earth and had formerly
        been occupied by people from Cíbola. This is of interest, especially
        since it is quite certain that the seven cities visited were identical
        with the Pueblo towns around old Zuñi on the Zuñi River in New Mexico

      <a id="Footnote_463" href="#FNanchor_463" class="label">[463]</a> “It was ever a source of wonder to us why these ancient
        people sought such inaccessible places for their homes. They were
        doubtless an agricultural race, but there were no lands here of any
        considerable extent which they could have cultivated. To the west
        of Oraiby, and of the towns of the Province of Tusayan, in northern
        Arizona, the inhabitants have actually built little terraces along the
        face of the cliff, where a spring gushes out, and there made their site
        for gardens. It is possible that the ancient inhabitants of this place
        made their lands in the same way. But why should they seek such spots?
        Surely the country was not so crowded with population as to demand the
        utilization of a region like this. The only solution which suggests
        itself is this: We know that for a century or two after the settlement
        of Mexico, many expeditions were sent into the country now comprising
        Arizona and New Mexico for the purpose of bringing the town-building
        people under the dominion of the Spanish government. Many of their
        villages were destroyed, and the inhabitants fled to regions at that
        time unknown, and there are traditions among the people who now inhabit
        the pueblos which remain, that the cañons were these unknown lands.
        It may be that these buildings were erected at that time. Sure it is
        that they had a much more modern appearance than the ruins scattered
        over Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.”—<cite>Major Powell
        in Scribner</cite>, vol. ix, p. 525. <i>Id.</i>, <cite>Explorations of the
        Colorado River of the West</cite>, pp. 87, 88.

      <a id="Footnote_513" href="#FNanchor_513" class="label">[513]</a> The original accounts furnished by actual explorers of
        Copan are as follows: 1st, by the Licenciado Diego García de Palacio,
        who prepared an account of his duties and their performance, for the
        king, Felipe II of Spain, dated March 8, 1576, and preserved in the
        Muñoz collection of MSS. The account has been published several times,
        at least once in the United States, in Palacio, <cite>Carta Dirijida al
        Rey</cite>, Albany, 1860, and translated into English by E. G. Squier;
        2d, an account by Fuentes y Guzman, in a MS. dated 1689. However, so
        much as related to Copan was published in 1808 in Juarros, <cite>Compendio
        de la Hist. de la Ciudad de Guatemala</cite>, trans. in English in 1823;
        3d, by Col. Juan Galindo, an officer in Central American service
        (explorations made in 1835), published communication in <cite>Am. Antiq.
        Soc. Trans.</cite>, vol. ii, pp. 545–50, and in <cite>Antiq. Mex.</cite>, tom.
        i, div. ii, pp. 73, 76; 4th, Stephens and Catherwood in 1839, published
        in <cite>Incidents and Travels in Central America</cite>, vol. i, pp, 95–160.
        New York, 1841.

      <p>The ruins have been visited by two or three persons since described
        by Stephens, but the public has not enjoyed the benefit of their
        researches, as we believe nothing has since been published on Copan.
        Brasseur de Bourbourg, who visited the ruins in 1863 and 1866,
        testifies to the perfect accuracy of the descriptions and plates in
        Stephens’ and Catherwood’s work. A considerable number of notices of
        Copan have been made up by different writers from these sources. The
        latest and best of such notices is that by Mr. Bancroft, <cite>Native
        Races</cite>, vol. iv, pp. 77–105, from whose bibliographical note we have
        drawn somewhat for the above facts.</p>

        548, the same author in a note translates the following interesting
        passage from Sr. Garcia y Cubas: “The pyramids of Teotihuacan, as they
        exist to day, are not in their primitive state. There is now a mass of
        loose stones whose interstices covered with vegetable earth have caused
        to spring up the multitude of plants and flowers with which the faces
        of the pyramids are now covered. This mass of stones differs from the
        plan of construction followed in the body of the monuments and besides
        the falling of these stones, which has taken place chiefly on the
        eastern face of the Moon, has laid bare an inclined plane perfectly
        smooth, which seems to be the true face of the pyramid. This isolated
        observation would not give so much force to my argument if it were not
        accompanied by the same circumstances in all the monuments.” This inner
        smooth surface has an inclination of 47°, differing from the angle of
        the outer faces. Sr. Garcia y Cubas, conjectures that the Toltecs, the
        descendants of the civilized architects of these monuments, fearing
        that they would be despoiled by the savages who followed them, covered
        up their sacred places with the outer coatings described. See Appendix.

      <a id="Footnote_547" href="#FNanchor_547" class="label">[547]</a> Quemada was at first mentioned by early writers as one
        of the stations in the Aztec migration. Captain Lyon published in
        his <cite>Journal</cite>, vol. i. pp. 225–44, the result of explorations
        performed by him at Los Edificios in 1826. Another report was made by
        Sr. Esparza from data furnished him by Pedro Rivera in 1830, which
        appeared in Esparza’s <cite>Informe presentado al Gobierno</cite>, pp. 56–8,
        and <cite>Museo Mex.</cite>, tom. i, pp. 185 <i>et seq.</i> Herr Berghes
        made a pretty good survey of the ruins in 1831: his observations were
        published by Nebel. Herr Burkart, a companion of Berghes, published a
        description in his <cite>Aufenthalt und Reisen in Mexico</cite>, tom. ii, pp.
        97–105. Nebel published his observations in his <cite>Viaje</cite>. Several
        authors have made up notices from these sources without adding any
        original information. A list of these, as well as those given above,
        may be found in Bancroft’s <cite>Native Races</cite>, vol. iv, pp. 578–9.

      <a id="Footnote_597" href="#FNanchor_597" class="label">[597]</a> Mr. Bancroft remarks, “He happens, however, here to have
        selected two Egyptian subjects which almost find their counterparts in
        America. In the preceding volume of this work, page 333, is given a cut
        of what is called the ‘Tablet of the Cross’ at Palenque. In this we
        see a cross and perched upon it a bird, to which (or to the cross) two
        human figures in profile, apparently priests, are making an offering.
        In Mr. Stephens’ representation from the Vocal Memnon we find almost
        the same thing, the differences being, that instead of an ornamented
        Latin cross, we have here a <i lang="la">crux commissa</i>, or <i lang="la">patibulata</i>;
        that instead of one bird there are two, not on the cross but
        immediately above it, and that the figures, though in profile and
        holding the same general positions, are dressed in a different manner,
        and are apparently binding the cross with the lotus instead of making
        an offering to it; in Mr. Stephens’ representation from the obelisk of
        Carnac, however, a priest is evidently making an offering to a large
        bird perched upon an altar; and here again the human figures occupy the
        same position. The hieroglyphics, though the characters are of course
        different, are, it will be noticed, disposed upon the stone in much the
        same manner. The frontispiece of Stephens’ <cite>Cent. Amer.</cite>, vol. ii,
        described on p. 352, represents the tablet, on the back wall of the
        altar, Casa No. 3 at Palenque. Once more here are two priests clad in
        all the elaborate insignia of their office, standing one on either side
        of a table or altar, upon which are erected two batons, crossed in such
        a manner as to form a <i lang="la">crux decussata</i>, and supporting a hideous
        mask. To this emblem they are making an offering.”—<cite>Bancroft’s Native
        Races</cite>, vol. v, pp. 60–1, note.

      <a id="Footnote_655" href="#FNanchor_655" class="label">[655]</a> “It is impossible on reading what Mexican mythology
        records of the war in heaven, and of the fall of Zoutemoque and
        the other rebellious spirits; of the creation of light by the word
        Touacatecutli, and of the division of the waters; of the sin of
        Yztlacohuhqui, and his blindness and nakedness; of the temptation of
        Suchiquecal and her disobedience in gathering roses from a tree, and
        the consequent misery and disgrace of herself and all her posterity—not
        to recognize scriptural analogies. But the Mexican tradition of the
        deluge is that which bears the most unequivocal marks of having been
        derived from a Hebrew source. This tradition records that a few
        persons escaped in the Ahuehuete, or ark of fir, when the earth was
        swallowed up by the deluge, the chief of whom was named Patecatle or
        Cipaquetona; that he invented the art of making wine; that Xelua, one
        of his descendants, at least one of those who escaped with him in the
        ark, was present at the building of a high tower, which the succeeding
        generation constructed with a view of escaping from the deluge should
        it again occur; that Tonacatecutli, incensed at their presumption,
        destroyed the tower with lightning, confounded their language and
        dispersed them; and that Xelua led a colony to the New World.”—<cite>Mex.

        baptism: “The midwife took the infant in her arms naked, and carried it
        into the court of the mother’s house, in which court were strewed reeds
        or rushes, which they call Tule, upon which was placed a small vessel
        of water, in which the said midwife bathed the said infant; and after
        she had bathed it, three boys being seated near the said rushes, eating
        roasted maize mixed with boiled beans, which kind of food they named
        Yxcue, which provision or paste they set before the said boys, in order
        that they might eat it. After the said bathing or washing, the said
        midwife desired the said boys to pronounce the name aloud, bestowing a
        new name on the infant which had been thus bathed; and the name which
        they gave it was that which the midwife wished.”—<cite>Mex. Antiq.</cite>,

        Indians was not confined to the human species.” Also vol. viii, p. 155:
        “The head of the Totonac high-priest, was anointed by the blood of

        the following: “A certain ecclesiastic wrote to a priest commissioned
        by Las Casas, that he met a principle-lord, who, on being questioned
        respecting the ancient religion which they professed, told him that
        they knew and believed in the God who was in Heaven, and that this
        God was the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and that the Father was named
        Yzona, who had created man; and that the Son was called Bacab, who was
        born of a virgin of the name of Chiribirias, and that the mother of
        Chiribirias was named Yxchel; and that the Holy Ghost was named Echvah.
        Of Bacab, the Son, they said he was put to death and scourged and
        crowned with thorns and placed with his arms extended upon a beam of
        wood, to which they did not suppose that he had been nailed, but that
        he was tied, where he died and remained dead during three days, and on
        the third day came to life and ascended into heaven, where he is with
        his Father; and that immediately afterwards Echvah, who is the Holy
        Ghost, came and filled the earth with whatsoever it stood in need of.”

        may have reached those remote parts at an early day. On pp. 281–9 he
        gives a list of words chosen from the Quiché, Cakchiquel and Zutohil,
        showing analogies with languages of Northern Europe, especially with
        the Scandinavian. Also see the same author in the <cite>Nouv. Ann. des
        Voy.</cite>, 6th series, vol. iii, 1855, pp. 156–7. The Abbé in a letter
        to the <cite>New York Tribune</cite>, November 21st, 1855, in referring
        to the early inhabitants of Vera Paz, says: “<em>They came from the
        east</em>—not from the south-east, <em>but from the north-east</em>. I
        speak only of the tribes of Quiché-Cakchiquel and Zutohil. They came
        from the north-east, certainly passed through the United States, and as
        they say themselves, <em>they crossed the sea in darkness, mist, cold
        and snow</em>. I suppose they must have come from Denmark and Norway.
        They came in small numbers, and lost their white blood by their mixture
        with the Indians whom they found—whether in the United States or in
        these regions, certainly there must have been a Tula in our northern
        European countries. But what is more convincing of this migration or
        passage, I find the same result by a comparison of the languages. I
        cannot speak of the structure of them, but by what I have observed is
        that the fundamental forms and words of the languages of these regions
        (except the Mexican) are intimately connected with the Maya or Tzendal,
        and that all the words that are neither Mexican nor Maya belong to our
        languages of Northern Europe, viz.: English, Saxon, Danish, Norwegian,
        Swedish, Flemish and German, some even appear to belong to the French
        or Persian.”

      <a id="Footnote_717" href="#FNanchor_717" class="label">[717]</a> Dr. Farrar, referring to the Basque, says: “What is
        certain about it is, that its structure is polysynthetic, like the
        language of America. Like them, and them only, it habitually forms its
        compounds by the elimination of certain radicals in the simple words;
        so that, <i>e. g.</i>, <i>ilhun</i>, twilight, is contracted from
        <i>hill</i>, dead, and <i>egun</i>, day; and <i>belhaun</i>, the knee,
        from <i>belhar</i>, front, and <i>oin</i>, leg. It was this fact that
        made Larramendi give to his treatise on Basque grammar the title of
        ‘The Impossible Overcome.’ The most daring of all the hypotheses which
        have been suggested points to the conceivable existence of some great
        Atlantis; to the possibility of the ‘Basque area being the remains of
        a vast system, of which Madeira and the Azores are fragments belonging
        to the Miocene period.’ Be this as it may, the fact is indisputable
        and is eminently noteworthy that, while the affinities of the Basque
        roots have never been conclusively elucidated, there has never been
        any doubt that this isolated language, preserving its identity in a
        western corner of Europe between two mighty kingdoms, resembles in its
        grammatical structure the aboriginal languages of the vast opposite
        continent, and those alone.”—<cite>Families of Speech</cite>, pp. 132–3.

        Wörtern beruhen (da zufällig diese Buchstaben-combinationem in
        der Azt. Sprache nicht vorkommen, aber ihren Wesen nach recht gut
        vorkommen könnten). Solche Wörter sind: <i>iztocoti</i> = Muschel
        (dazu Eigenname <i>iztocoti</i> No. 923); <i>majati</i> = jagd (caza),
        <i>mamati</i> = Hof, <i>muztati</i> = Regenbogen: <i>cucustlati</i> =
        Nasenloch, <i>natlaycazte</i> = Rippen; <i>otniquit</i> = Jungfrau;
        <i>mamatle</i> = Schiff; <i>oumatle</i> = Leib; <i>aguequetle</i>
        = Hunger; <i>capitzitle</i> = Dieb; <i>tahechitle</i> = larga:
        <i>temextixitle</i> = Kuss; <i>cuachitle</i> = reisen; <i>cuchitle</i>
        = pincher; <i>meyali</i> = Schmerz. Es giebt noch eine höhere Gattung
        von Nutka-Wörtern (der Span. Reise), welche (besonders durch die
        Aechtheit ihrer Endung von der vorigen verschieden) ganz und gar
        wie mexicanische Wörter aussehen, und (so weit sie substantiva
        sind) mexicanische sein würden, wenn es der Sprache beliebt hätte
        diese bestimmten Lautgestalten zu bilden: <i>inapatl</i> = Rücken;
        <i>tlexatl</i> = Matte; <i>tzahuacatl</i> = 9; <i>chamiehtl</i> = Iris;
        <i>naguatzitl</i> = Zwerg; <i>naschitl</i> = Tag; <i>jacamitl</i> =
        viereckig; <i>huatzacchitl</i> = Husten; <i>nectzitl</i> = trinken;
        <i>pugxitl</i> = heben; <i>cocotl</i> = Seeotter; <i>amanutl</i>
        = espinilla; <i>apactzutl</i> = Bart; <i>ictlatzutl</i> = Mund;
        <i>iniyutl</i> = Kehle; <i>jayutl</i> = Fluth; <i>tlatlacastzeme</i>
        = Blätter (wie ein Mex. Plural in <i>me</i>); <i>coyactzac</i> =
        Fuchsbalg. Noch mehr Wörter finden sich, wenn man für die Mex.
        Sprache unnatürliche und zu harte Consonanten—Verbindungen übersieht.
        Diese letzte höhere Gattung vorzüglich, doch auch die erstere meint
        Alexander von Humboldt in der obigen Stelle (S. 363). So gawinnt die
        Nutka-Sprache durch eine reiche Zahl von Wörtern und durch grosse
        Züge ihres Lautwesens, einzig von allen anderen fremden, die ich
        habe aufdecken können, in einem bedeutenden Theile eine täuschende
        Aehnlichkeit mit der Aztekischen oder Mexicanischen; und so wird die
        ihr schon früher gewidmete Aufmerksamkeit vollständig gerechtfertigt.
        Ihrer Mexicanischen Erscheinrung fehlt aber, wie ich von meiner Seite
        hier ausspreche jede Wirklichkeit.”—<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 371.</p>

      <p>We have no means at hand of testing the following statement from

        California since the discovery of gold, bear a striking resemblance
        to the Indians, and are known to be able to converse with them in
        their respective languages to an extent that cannot be the result of
        mere coincidence of expression.”—<cite>Cronaise, The Natural Wealth of
        California</cite>, p. 31. Probably a mistake.</p>

        to climb upon their houses, and the houses tumbling down fell to the
        ground; they wished to climb upon the trees, and the trees shook them
        off; they wished to enter into the grottoes, and the grottoes closed
        themselves before them.’ In the <cite>Codex Chimalpopoca</cite>, the author,
        speaking of the destruction which took place by fire, says: ‘The third
        sun is called <cite>Quia-Tonatiuh</cite>, sun of rain, because there fell
        a rain of fire; all which existed burned, and there fell a rain of
        gravel.’ They also narrate that whilst the sandstone which we now see
        scattered about, and the <i>tetzontli</i> (amygdaloide poreuse) boiled
        with great tumult, there also rose the rocks of vermillion color. Now
        this was in the year <i>Ce Tecpactl</i>, One Flint, it was the day
        <i>Nahui-Quiahuitl</i>, Fourth Rain. Now, in this day, in which men
        were lost and destroyed in a rain of fire, they were transformed into
        goslings; the sun itself was on fire, and everything, together with the
        houses, was consumed.” Brasseur recounts a Haytian legend concerning
        the origin of the sea and isles: “There was, they say, a powerful man
        called Iaia, who, having murdered his only son, wished to bury him;
        but not knowing where to put him, enclosed him in a calabash, which he
        placed afterwards at the foot of a high mountain, situated a little
        distance from the place where he lived; on account of his affection
        for his son he often went to the spot. One day, having opened it (the
        calabash), there came out whales and other very large fishes, of which
        Iaia, full of fear, having returned home, told his neighbors what
        had happened, saying that this calabash was filled with water and
        innumerable fishes. This news being spread abroad, four twin brothers,
        desiring to obtain fish, went to the place where the calabash was.
        Just as they had taken it in their hand to open it, Iaia came, and
        they seeing him, threw the calabash on the ground, in their fear of
        him. This (the calabash) having burst, on account of the great weight
        which was enclosed in it, the waters gushed forth, and the interminable
        plain, which stretched farther than the eye could reach, was flooded
        and covered with water. The mountains alone, because of their great
        height, were not submerged in this great inundation. So they believed
        that these mountains were the islands and the other divisions of the
        earth which we see in the world.”—<cite>Brasseur de Bourbourg</cite>, in
        <cite>Landa’s Relacion</cite>, pp. xxi–iv.

        observation, it is evident that the voyage from China to America can
        be made without being out of sight of land more than a few hours at a
        time. To a landsman, unfamiliar with long voyages, the mere idea of
        being ‘alone on the wide, wide sea’ with nothing but water visible,
        even for an hour, conveys a strange sense of desolation, of daring
        and adventure. But in truth it is regarded as a mere trifle, not only
        by regular seafaring men, but even by the rudest races in all parts
        of the world; and I have no doubt that from the remotest ages, and on
        all shores, fishermen in open boats, canoes, or even coracles, guided
        simply by the stars and currents, have not hesitated to go far out
        of sight of land. At the present day, natives of the South Pacific
        islands undertake, without a compass, and successfully, long voyages

        relationship of America to Asia.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
